1979	Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert shot and killed her neighbor's dog.	In October 2022, a widely shared Facebook post accused Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of shooting and killing a neighbor's dog in Garfield County, Colorado, a previous month. The post, which was deleted after it gained attention from media outlets (including Snopes), claimed that Boebert shot and killed the dog, a husky named Omega, on Aug. 17 after it supposedly attacked the congresswoman's goats.It was true that a dog was fatally shot around Boebert's property, according to her office and the Garfield County Sheriff's Office. However, according to both groups, it was a different neighbor ‚Äî not Boebert ‚Äî who shot the dog. The sheriff's office emailed us this statement:In reference to the August 17, 2022 shooting of a dog at or near the Boebert residence in Silt, CO, [a] summons was issued for the shooting,¬†(not to Representative Lauren Boebert as she was not the shooter). That case was turned-over to the District Attorney‚Äôs Office for further examination and determination of final charges. We do not know the disposition of that case.¬†The Daily Mail reportedly spoke to the person who claimed responsibility for the dog's death, Brady Hogan. He corroborated Boebert‚Äôs account: that he shot the dog on her property after it attacked goats and other animals. We attempted to reach Hogan ourselves to independently verify his experience, and we will update this story when, or if, we hear from him.We also attempted to reach the person who authored the viral Facebook post, Yaritza Mendoza, and we are waiting for a response. (After the post gained attention, Mendoza¬†reportedly told The Daily Mail that she was now unsure of her original story.)[Read more: Lauren Boebert‚Äôs Alleged Dog Shooting Story, Explained]	false

"In June 2020, as protests against police violence and racial justice took place around the U.S. and elsewhere, a video spread on social media supposedly showing a clip from the Japanese anime series ""Sailor Moon"" in which the main characters call cops ""dirty pigs,"" ""fascists,"" and ""class traitors"":The images in this clip truly come from an episode of ""Sailor Moon,"" but these captions are not ""100% accurate"" as one Twitter user claimed.The images come from an episode entitled ""Fight to the Finish,"" in which the Sailor Soldiers fight a group of impostor police officers that were created by antagonist Jedite.¬†A description of the episode from the ""Sailor Moon"" fandom wiki reads: ""As a safety precaution, members of the Keishich≈ç, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, are stationed in the airport, but Jedite puts them all to sleep before replacing them with fakes to attack the Sailor Scouts.

1807	President Trump rolled back rules protecting residents of nursing homes.	"On 24 December 2017, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was scaling back an Obama-era policy that ramped up the use of fines on skilled nursing facilities for actions that endangered vulnerable patients:The Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury, part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president.The shift in the Medicare program‚Äôs penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry. The American Health Care Association, the industry‚Äôs main trade group, has complained that under President Barack Obama, federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve.As would be expected, the Times report (which was published on Christmas Eve) resulted in a number of aggregated stories crafted to play up the outrage angle with sensational headlines reporting, essentially, that the president was going to kill Grandma on Christmas. Over-the-top wording as in this headline, ""Trump Will Permit Abuse Of Elderly In Nursing Homes,"" prompted readers to inquire whether the story was true.Elder abuse is a crime, and that has not changed. However, the Trump administration did begin the process of rolling back an Obama administration policy that uses hefty fines as leverage against facilities that cause serious harm to patients. The Trump administration issued two Notices of Proposed Rule-Making (NPRMs) in May and June of 2017 which will reverse rules requiring the presence of a designated facility grievance officer to handle allegations of wrongdoing, and prohibiting nursing homes from requiring patients to sign pre-dispute arbitration agreements as a condition of admission. These changes do not mean that rampant, unchecked abuse will be allowed to take place, as some headlines have suggested however.In November 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also issued a moratorium on a requirement that nursing homes develop a baseline care plan for new patients within 48 hours of admission, along with seven other requirements on things like behavioral health care, psychotropic medication and facility assessments.The effects of the rollbacks are not yet known, but Toby Edelman, senior attorney for the Center for Medicare Advocacy, told the Times, ""They‚Äôve pretty much emasculated enforcement, which was already weak."" According to federal records reviewed by the Times, four in every ten nursing homes have been cited at least once since 2013 for a serious violations such as neglect, mistreatment and failing to protect residents from accidents and bed sores.CMS put an 18-month moratorium on a requirement that nursing homes develop a basic care plan for new patients within 48 hours. This rule was put in place after the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found in a study published in 2014 that one in five Medicare patients experienced medical complications within an average 15 days of admission to nursing facilities, most of which were serious, preventable and resulted in millions in additional medical expenses billed to Medicare.However in a memo to state health departments, CMS noted that the moratorium does not mean violation of requirements will result in no enforcement. Requirements that fall under the purview of the moratorium, like the baseline care plan, will simply be handled differently until the end of the moratorium period.In a statement, Center for Medicare Advocacy policy attorney Dara Valanejad told us:The Center for Medicare Advocacy is greatly concerned by the Administration's actions rolling back the minimum standards of care set out in the Medicare and Medicaid Requirements of Participation. CMS should be protecting the rights of residents, who should be its primary focus, not referring to the nursing home industry as its ‚Äúcustomer.‚Äù The minimum nursing home standards were implemented because there was an unmet need for urgent resident protections. For example, the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reported in 2014 that one in five residents experienced harm within the first month of admission (the average was 15.5 days) to a skilled nursing facility, 20 percent of these cases resulted in life-sustaining interventions or death, and 59 percent of these adverse events were ‚Äúclearly or likely preventable.‚Äù The Baseline Care Plan, one of the Phase 2 Requirements that CMS placed an 18-month moratorium on, requires nursing homes to develop a basic care plan within 48 hours to address the type of problems that the OIG found. How can nursing home residents and their families feel safe knowing that such vital requirements, meant to protect them from harm, injury, or death, will not be properly enforced?Per the Times report, the American Health Care Association sent a letter to then-President Elect Trump in December 2016 asking for ""relief"" from regulations and complained to CMS:Rather than spending quality time with their patients, the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn‚Äôt increase the quality of care they provide."	true

Reid said:¬†The video that circulated on social media a couple of weeks ago was never part of a Ford ""ad campaign"" anywhere. It began as an attempt by our team in Europe to turn a negative into a positive with in-kind response to a social comment in 2021 asserting that a color of the then-new Ranger Raptor truck was 'very gay' ‚Äì something which offended colleagues and customers. Doing so was consistent with Ford's values to include, support and protect people of all genders, races and sexual orientations. No such vehicle has been sold by Ford in Europe or elsewhere.In September 2021, ABC 10 News reported that Ford of Germany had created the car in response to a social media post that referred to the ""Performance Blue"" color option on Ranger Raptors as ""very gay.""

6083	"The vice president of Pfizer said human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil is ""deadly."""	"In late February 2018, an article posted to ""alternative health"" blog HealthNutNews.com¬†began circulating, leading readers to believe that the vice president of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer had ""blown the whistle"" on Gardasil, a vaccine that protects against¬†human papillomavirus, an umbrella term for several viruses spread by intimate contact which can¬†lead to cervical cancer if left untreated. The headline on the story cautions that the vaccine is ""deadly.""The article is a misleading and confusing hodgepodge of conflicting information, including quotes from medical professionals taken out of context and purposely mischaracterized. For example, the ""Pfizer vice president"" referenced in the headline is Dr. Peter Rost, who was not the vice president but a vice president of marketing for Pfizer, and who was fired in 2005 after a public skirmish with his employer in which he claimed to be a whistleblower over drug pricing.Of course, it's unclear how a an executive would ""blow the whistle"" on a product his company doesn't make anyway ‚Äî Gardisil is manufactured by Merck, not Pfizer.The HealthNutNews.com story contradicts its own headline within the first two paragraphs:The former vice president of Pfizer, Dr. Peter Rost, can be seen in the video clip below, discussing what many of us have been saying for years: the Gardasil vaccine is dangerous and Big Pharma just wants to keep people unhealthy. The clip below, taken from the yet to be released ‚ÄúOne More Girl‚Äù documentary ‚Äì features Dr. Rost revealing how vaccines and Big Pharma drugs are designed to keep people in a state of dis-ease.NOTE: Dr. Rost doesn‚Äôt directly say ‚ÄúGardasil is dangerous‚Äù but he‚Äôs discussing the vaccine in the documentary ‚ÄúGardasil: One More Girl.‚Äù Again, the topic IS THE GARDASIL VACCINE. Although he might not use the words, that vaccine is the topic of the interview.In the roughly two-minute video embedded in the story, Rost never mentions Gardasil or any vaccine at all. Instead, he appears to be talking in general terms about his views on the pharmaceutical industry's ""buying influence"" over academic institutions and building too-cozy relationships with researchers who should be unbiased in testing drugs ‚Äî hardly an earth-shattering revelation about a specific vaccine or treatment.The article also contains two quotes from two medical publishing professionals, neither of whom was talking about vaccines or their efficacy:‚ÄúIt is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine.‚Äù ‚Äì Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime editor-in-chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ) ‚Äú‚ÄúThe case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.‚Äù ‚Äì Dr. Richard Horton, the current editor-in-chief of the Lancet ‚Äì considered to be one of the most well respected peer-reviewed medical journals in the world.Both Angell and Horton edit two prominent medical journals, and both have written editorials that criticize scientific studies and concerns over conflicts of interest created by relationships between researchers and pharmaceutical companies. Neither mentioned vaccines, however. In an e-mail, Horton told us:Yes, this is a wonderful example of selective quotation. I believe that quote is taken from a report of a meeting I attended and wrote about. ‚ÄúThe case against science‚Äù is one extreme view that is worrying scientists because of a concern about the reproducibility of some studies. We have to face up to criticisms of science today in order to defeat those criticisms.Angell's quote was taken from a 2015 op-ed in the New York Review of Books, in which she wrote:The problems I‚Äôve discussed are not limited to psychiatry, although they reach their most florid form there. Similar conflicts of interest and biases exist in virtually every field of medicine, particularly those that rely heavily on drugs or devices. It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of TheNew England Journal of Medicine.One result of the pervasive bias is that physicians learn to practice a very drug-intensive style of medicine. Even when changes in lifestyle would be more effective, doctors and their patients often believe that for every ailment and discontent there is a drug. Physicians are also led to believe that the newest, most expensive brand-name drugs are superior to older drugs or generics, even though there is seldom any evidence to that effect because sponsors do not usually compare their drugs with older drugs at equivalent doses. In addition, physicians, swayed by prestigious medical school faculty, learn to prescribe drugs for off-label uses without good evidence of effectiveness.This fear-mongering about alleged dangers of HPV vaccines is not based in any fact. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccines are safe for most of the public, though (like any drug) they may have side effects, or in rare cases, may result in an allergic reaction. It's not the first time a vaccine has been falsely accused of causing ailments, when they in fact guard the general public from outbreaks¬†‚Äî a previous HealthNutNews.com story falsely reported that vaccines were causing 2018's deadly influenza season.HPV vaccines have been controversial in part because they guard young girls against a sexually-transmitted virus that can lead to cervical cancer; thus, critics often blur the line between religious and anti-science hysteria when discouraging their use. As¬†Joseph Uscinski, associate professor of political science at the University of Miami, pointed out, paranoia about this particular vaccine is enabled by parents who are afraid that providing girls with the vaccine will somehow promote promiscuity:When they hear that the vaccine is actually bad for the kids, it sort of makes them feel it's okay not to give it to them.He pointed to 2011, when former Minnesota representative and far-right Christian activist Michele Bachmann attacked then-presidential candidate and Texas Governor Rick Perry for an HPV vaccine mandate, falsely saying it causes ""mental retardation.""¬†Uscinski said:"	false

634	"Echoing Adolf Hitler's exact words from 1928, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor said, ""We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity. Our movement is Christian."""	"On Aug. 1, 2022, we received mail from our readers asking us to find out if U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., had repeated a 1928 utterance by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler about Christianity. The original Hitler quote, which we authenticated previously, read, ""We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity. Our movement is Christian.""A meme that appeared in several public Facebook posts (and likely quite a few private postings as well) also attributed that statement to Greene, as if she were echoing Hitler's exact words. However, we found no record of Greene repeating Hitler's statement about Christianity.¬†While it's true that Hitler said these words, we were unable to find any evidence that Greene ever repeated the quote.We looked to reporting from Salon and HuffPost. It appeared that the idea to add Greene to the Hitler meme was likely inspired after she was interviewed at the conservative Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit (SAS). The student event took place on July 23, 2022 in Tampa, Florida. The same date was mentioned in the meme under Greene's name.On or around July 23, Greene was interviewed by Tayler Hansen with the conservative Next News Network. A video of the interview was published on Twitter:During the interview, the following exchange took place, in which Greene called herself a ""Christian nationalist"":Hansen: What do you think is the primary focus of the GOP going into 2022? What should it be opposed to what is it?Greene: Oh wow. That's such a good question, because there's a lot of things it should be. I think Republicans really need to recognize the people they represent, ok? Their voters. Not the lobbyist donors. Not the corporate backs. Not those people. That's not who the Republican Party should represent.We need to be the party of nationalism. And I'm a Christian and I say it proudly: We should be Christian nationalists. And when Republicans learn to represent most of the people that vote for them, then we will be the party that continues to grow without having to chase down certain identities or chase down, you know, certain segments of people. We just need to represent Americans. And most Americans, no matter how they vote, really care about the same things, and I want to see Republicans actually do their job. That's what I want to see.In addition to the interview, Greene spoke onstage at the student event in Tampa about why she refers to herself as a ""nationalist."" At the 4:07 mark in the following YouTube video, Greene said, ""If you're a nationalist, that means you care about your country, which we should. Now, all of our tax dollars are hard-earned tax dollars, they should go towards our country, isn't that right?""Greene added remarks at the 8:18 mark in the video about referring to herself specifically as a ""Christian nationalist"":I also call myself a Christian nationalist. And that's not a bad word. That's actually a good thing, right? And there's nothing wrong with leading with your faith, because we should lead with our faith, because if we're doing that then we're doing the right thing. Doesn't mean we're perfect. It just means we're doing the right thing, and I think that's what the Republican Party needs to be about. The Republican Party also needs to be the party that cares about the American worker, not the corporations.The ""Christian nationalist"" remarks from Greene led to backlash from Christian groups Faithful America and Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, as well as colleagues in Congress.In sum, the meme's claim that Greene repeated the words Hitler uttered about Christianity in 1928 is false."	false

4269	"A video shows a ""leader"" of the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP), Raz Simone, giving a semi-automatic weapon to a fellow protester."	"On June 15, 2020, right-wing commentator Andy Ngo tweeted a video showing Raz Simone, described by some as the leader of the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) in Seattle, ‚Äúhanding out a long rifle to another person inside the Seattle BLM.‚Äù Simone, a Seattle-based rapper and activist, is often described ‚Äî at least in conservative media reports ‚Äî as the leader of this particular Black Lives Matter protest. Such protests swept across the U.S. after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man, while in the custody of a white police officer in Minneapolis.¬†The clip is genuine and comes from a 5 1/2-hour Facebook Live video streamed on Simone‚Äôs profile. The moment highlighted by Ngo, in which Simone appears to give a gun to a self-identified 18-year-old he does not appear to know, begins at around the 2:08:00 mark. While the CHOP has no formal leader, Simone has been active in ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù operations and in mediating discussions between protesters and the city. Simone‚Äôs livestreamed videos from the CHOP have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. In those videos, he can be seen speaking to crowds, to individual protesters, and to city personnel.Although it was shared on June 15, 2020, the video Ngo tweeted took place on the night of June 8, 2020, which was the first night of the CHOP protest. The day before, Nikolas Fernandez drove toward a crowd of protesters and shot one in the arm before fleeing toward the police. That evening, police cleared the protest, which had been blocked from progressing past the Seattle Police East Precinct, using flash bombs and chemical irritants.¬†The next day, with tensions heightened, police removed barriers that had blocked protesters from the East Precinct, secured the building, and gradually removed officers from the area. As described in The Stranger, an alternative bi-weekly newspaper, protesters took the opportunity to occupy the area abandoned by police:For several minutes, others in the crowd moseyed around in the intersection, wondering what to do next. Suspicion understandably reigned. Why did the cops decide to pack up their shit and abandon their post? Were they trying to set up the protesters, expecting them to burn the place down to prove a point?Organizers first gathered people to the center of the intersection on 12th and Pine and encouraged the crowd to keep the peace. ‚Ä¶ They drained water from water barriers and set up a perimeter one block in every direction from the station. Bicycle fencing, cement blocks, and cars formed street barricades. On 11th and Pine, a cardboard sign duct-taped to a barrier read, ""You Are Entering Free Capitol Hill.The move, according to an explanation from Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan five hours after the fact, was meant to ‚Äúproactively de-escalate interactions between protestors and law enforcement outside the East Precinct.‚ÄùBut the first night in ‚ÄúFree Capitol Hill,‚Äù while peaceful, was characterized by paranoia. In an unexpected development, protesters were now ‚Äî in their eyes ‚Äî responsible for their own security, and a rumor developed that members of the right-wing group Proud Boys were going to move into the protest area to set fires and stir chaos.Simone repeatedly refers to this rumor with other protesters in the five-hour long video shot that night, and the moment highlighted in the Ngo video stemmed from a (false) report of Proud Boys gathering at one of the barricades."	true

As the world raced to reach herd immunity in the fight against COVID-19, Canada implemented what the government called some of the ‚Äústrongest‚Äù border measures in the world. In March 2021, Canadian officials announced that any travelers entering the nation would be required to ‚Äúimmediately quarantine in designated government facilities‚Äù if they tested positive for the virus.Snopes readers asked our team to verify the travel restrictions put in place after the claim went viral following the March 31 airing of ‚ÄúTucker Carlson Tonight.‚Äù During the broadcast, Fox host Tucker Carlson called the policy a ‚Äúlegitimately dangerous authoritarianism.‚Äù‚ÄúOn Monday, the country‚Äôs Prime Minister Justin Trudeau outlined his government‚Äôs new corona regulations. Canadians hoping to return to their country must be tested before and after takeoff,‚Äù said Carlson.The television personality went on to quote the below authentic tweet from Trudeau, which was shared on Twitter on March 29.¬†The basic claim is true. As of this writing, travelers flying into Canada were required to show a negative COVID-19 test result before boarding the plane and must also take a second test once they have arrived in the country. Visitors have to wait at an approved hotel ‚Äî at their own expense ‚Äî while they await a negative test result.‚ÄúIf your results come back negative for COVID-19, you‚Äôll be able to head home and finish your mandatory quarantine there,‚Äù tweeted the prime minister. ‚ÄúIf your test results come back positive, you‚Äôll need to immediately quarantine in designated government facilities. This is not optional.‚ÄùThose driving across the land border will also be required to show a negative test result taken within the last 72 hours. Additionally, they will also need to take a test upon arrival and a third toward the end of their 14-day mandatory quarantine.As of April 1, 2021, the temporary border restriction between the U.S. and Canada was still in place, prohibiting all discretionary or optional travel between the two nations. All travelers entering Canada, regardless of citizenship, were required to follow testing and quarantine requirements, which included a mandatory quarantine of at least 14 days after entering regardless of symptoms. At the time of this writing, those who had been vaccinated, tested negative, or recovered from COVID-19 were still required to quarantine. Those flying into Canada were required to spend three nights at a government-authorized hotel that must be booked and pre-paid before entering the country.Additionally, travelers must demonstrate that they have a suitable plan in place for their quarantine before entering Canada, and foreign nationals without one may be denied entry. Those who arrive in Canada without a suitable plan to quarantine would be directed to a ‚Äúfederal designated quarantine facility‚Äù for the full 14-day quarantine period.‚ÄúThese border measures are some of the strongest in the world ‚Äî and they‚Äôre in place to keep you, your loved ones, and your communities safe,‚Äù tweeted Trudeau.Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) are in charge of overseeing the federal quarantine facilities, and have actively spoken out against claims that they resemble internment or concentration camps.

Here is an example of one such post:The truth is, unsurprisingly, more nuanced, but the bottom line is that, contrary to what the above Twitter posts state, the effect of the legislation in question isn't that the Biden administration or Democrats will be ""tapping into"" or ""spying on"" bank or cash app accounts. This is a misleading characterization.What the legislation does is significantly lower the threshold for reporting taxable transactions made using cash apps like Venmo, PayPal, or Zelle for goods and services to the IRS. And when you reach that threshold, the app companies will then be required to send a tax form called a 1099-K to both you and the IRS.A 1099-K is, according to PayPal, an ""informational tax form that is used to report goods and services payments received by a business or individual in the calendar year.""As of this writing, the current threshold for such reporting is $20,000 and 200 payments in goods and services. Come Jan. 1, 2022, that reporting threshold will drop down to $600.This could have a significant impact on platform users' tax returns. Here's how Bloomberg Tax described how users might experience the change:For example, a model train collector may have paid $5,000 for model train pieces over several years that they now sell for $8,000, and the marketplace that introduced the seller to the buyer and through which the sale took place may charge the seller a total fee of $800. It may cost the model train seller $200 in postage to send the pieces to its buyers. The Form 1099-K that the seller will receive from the TPSO will report $8,000 in gross proceeds paid. However, the seller‚Äôs taxable gain from that sale would only be $2,000. As a result, collectors and other online sellers will need to keep extensive records of their expenses going forward to avoid over-reporting of income and overpayment of tax.Also, consider the alternative‚Äîa teenager who walks dogs to earn extra money. If their income in 2022 exceeds $600, their expenses may be limited to the fees charged by the website that connects them to pet owners, but they will owe income tax‚Äîand possibly self-employment tax‚Äîon the income they earn."	false
4879	"Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg was named the ""highest paid activist"" by People With Money magazine."	"In September 2019, as the spotlight shined bright on teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg, detractors attempted to discredit her with a variety of false rumors. For instance, some started sharing a doctored photograph of Thunberg with alt-right boogeyman George Soros (the original photograph featured former Vice President Al Gore). Others shared a miscaptioned image purportedly showing Thunberg with a member of ISIS (Thunberg was not in this photograph.)Another image purported to show Thunberg on the cover of People with Money magazine after she was named the ""highest paid activist.""¬†This is not a genuine magazine cover.¬†This image was created by the website MediaMass from a template the site has frequently employed in the past. Since at least 2013, MediaMass has created dozens of fake magazine covers of ""highest paid"" people. These doctored images have featured celebrities such as John Legend, Chuck Norris, Bob Dylan, Susan Boyle, and Reba McEntire:These covers are all identical with the exception of the main image. It appears that MediaMass simply places a basic template over a photograph of a celebrity.Here's a look at the blank template:¬†MediaMass published its fake magazine cover featuring Thunberg in an article titled ""Greta Thunberg Highest-Paid Activist in the World."" While the article initially reads like a genuine magazine piece, an update after the first paragraph explained that the rumor was false. Those who clicked on the explanation were directed to a disclaimer about MediaMass' content:¬†The website mediamass.net is the medium of our satire to expose with humour, exaggeration and ridicule the contemporary mass production and mass consumption that we observe.Also it will not only mock the producers (mainstream media, journalists) as it is common when questioning and criticizing mass media, but also the consumers as one cannot exist without the other. Sensationalism, lack of verification of information, ethics and standards issues are only symptoms of the actual social and economic order. This is particularly obvious when observing the role of social networking sites in spreading rumours."	false
1828	Various restaurants around the world were shut down for serving  for serving human meat.	"Rumors that some restaurant was shut down for serving human meat have been circulating online for years and flare up again from time to time, as in one report published by the web site news.states-tv.com in 2017 that claimed one such restaurant was called ""Rose Kitchen"" and was located in a hotel in Pretoria, South Africa:A hotel restaurant in pretoria, south africa has been shuttered by authorities for serving human flesh. According to our local correspondent, suspicious residents told police of rumors that the restaurant was cooking human meat for customers. Police then raided the restaurant, where they discovered fresh human heads that were still bleeding. The blood was in the process of being drained into a plastic bag.The restaurant, named Rose Kitchen, is a popular eating place in Sunnyside Pretoria.¬†However, news.states-tv.com and other web sitea, such as Meganews360 and CNN Channel, published near-verbatim  versions of the very same story, with the setting of the ""human flesh"" restaurant changed to Valletta, Malta, or Nairobi, Kenya, or Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.Although this text has made frequent appearances on disreputable web sites, these stories were all based on an errant and error-filled¬†article published by BBC Swahili in May 2015. The BBC eventually removed the article, then released a statement saying that¬†there was absolutely no truth to the story:The story about the Nigerian restaurant which we published here was a mistake and we apologise. It was incorrect and published without the proper BBC checks. We have removed the story and have launched an urgent investigation into how this happened.The BBC Swahili service‚Äôs reputation for accuracy and balance remains of paramount importance to us and we are taking the appropriate steps to insure that mistakes like this do not happen again.It is likely that the BBC conflated a genuine report from 2013 about two skulls being discovered in a Nigerian hotel room and a poorly sourced tabloid story about a restaurant serving human meat, the combination which created a rumor that then took on a life of its own.Despite the BBC's retraction, uncorrected versions of this story are still available on news sites such as MSN and the UK's Express as of this writing. Disreputable¬†web sites have also managed to keep this rumor in circulation by reposting the above-displayed text (occasionally changing the location) along with gruesome photographs of the alleged¬†precooked cadavers:Neither of these¬†images show actual human meat ‚Äî they are both props originally created to promote the zombie video game¬†Resident Evil 6.Another version of the hoax promotes the claim that restaurants in Tokyo serving human meat had opened; reporter Benjamin Fulford posted one such story, discussing a ""noodle shop featuring broth made from human bones and flesh,"" on 1 April 2016. However, Fulford made it clear that the piece was meant as an April Fool's joke by identifying himself as a reporter from ""CNN"" -- Cannibal News Network."	false
5018	Amazon allows customers in the United States to rent certain textbooks for a fee.	"In August 2019, the attentions of many Snopes readers evidently turned toward the upcoming academic year, and for some, the fall 2019 college semester. With that, we received multiple inquiries about whether the online retail giant Amazon really operates a program for college students to rent textbooks. It does.¬†Customers can go to the Amazon Textbooks Store here, search for new or used textbooks, pay a fee to rent them (typically until the end of the upcoming semester, whichever it might be), and have them shipped to their home, provided they live in the U.S. Customers must ship the textbook back to Amazon by its due date, or be charged an extension or buyout fee, which are set out under 'Rental Details' on the book page, in order emails and within a customer's order history.The textbook rental program was first launched in 2013, an Amazon spokesperson told us. Customers are not required to have an Amazon Prime or Amazon Prime Student membership in order to use it.¬†This page on the Amazon website addresses frequently asked questions, and this one contains the rental program's terms and conditions. We found two sample textbooks through the search function in the textbooks store section of the site, in order to test out the rental system. The return due date on both was Dec. 18, the end of the fall 2019 semester for many.In one case, a chemistry textbook with a list price of $300 was available for purchase for between $153 and $204 and available to rent for $30.61. For students who are not interested in owning the book, that represents a savings of 90% off the list price, and 80% off the purchase price of a used copy.¬†In the other case, we found a copy of the commonly used ""A Writer's Reference."" It had a list price of $81, the new paperback version was available for purchase for $79, the eTextbook was available to buy for $55, a plastic comb copy was available to buy new for $101, and a new copy of the spiral-bound version was available for purchase at $67. Students could also rent the spiral-bound version for $45, or rent the eTextbook until Dec. 12, for a minimum of $32 (the rental price increased as the rental period lengthened).¬†The two rental options represented savings of 33% and 42%, when compared to purchasing the spiral-bound or eTextbook versions, respectively. However, we also found that a used copy of the plastic comb version was available to purchase for just under $5 ‚Äî that's more than six times cheaper than the cheapest rental version and also allows a customer to keep the book. This somewhat complicated example illustrates that, although renting textbooks through the program could allow for significant savings in some cases, it does not always appear to be the most affordable option.¬†The rental program also appears, in general, to be targeted more towards particularly expensive reference books, such as those used in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) field, rather than the slimmer (and cheaper) books that professors in the humanities often assign in their curricula. However, we did find that some textbooks with list prices under $50, in various fields of study, were available to rent through the program.¬†We asked Amazon whether the company was consulting or collaborating with colleges and universities, in an effort to ensure the availability of textbooks that were, in fact, being assigned in curricula in the forthcoming fall 2019 semester. A spokesperson told us the company ""works with publishers of popular textbooks to try to ensure that books listed on curricula are available through Amazon‚Äôs rental program."""	true

3677	Jeffrey Epstein was spotted driving around at his New Mexico ranch, according to a YouTube clip showing a man in a red truck who resembles Epstein.	"Some conspiracy theories refuse to die.

It may be completely possible that he has ridden off into the New Mexico sunset.‚ÄùWe know that this is completely false. Multiple reputable sources have confirmed to the media before that Epstein is in fact dead, including Dr. Barbara Sampson, the chief medical examiner in New York City, who ruled his death a suicide by hanging. Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist hired by Epstein‚Äôs brother, disputed the official findings and claimed that he had been strangled instead. Baden also observed the autopsy done by city officials.Epstein‚Äôs Zorro Ranch, known for being the place where many of his accusers say they were trafficked and raped, is comprised of both public and private property.

In Sept. 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order saying that all federal employees would have to be vaccinated by Nov. 22, 2021. Another order required vaccinations of all contractors who did business with the federal government.¬†According to the White House website:Building on the President‚Äôs announcement in July to strengthen safety requirements for unvaccinated federal workers, the President has signed an Executive Order to take those actions a step further and require all federal executive branch workers to be vaccinated. The President also signed an Executive Order directing that this standard be extended to employees of contractors that do business with the federal government.Conservative website The Blaze reported that this meant that members of Congress and their staff did not fall under this mandate. This is correct.¬†The vaccine mandate refers to employees working in the executive branch of government. This covers the president, the vice president, and their offices, which include their advisors and staffers, the cabinet appointed by the president, and heads of various federal agencies. The mandate covers federal agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Treasury, and more. The armed forces are also included in the executive branch. According to the White House, the total number of people employed in this branch are 4 million.¬†The legislative and judicial branches are separate from the executive branch, and do not fall under this vaccine mandate. Biden also cannot mandate as president that all Americans get vaccinated.

The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) wants to cover funeral expenses for families whose loved ones died due to COVID-19. According to its website, the agency would ‚Äúprovide financial assistance for COVID-19-related funeral expenses incurred after January 20, 2020,‚Äù and will implement this program starting April 2021.FEMA also said it would be sharing a dedicated toll-free number where people can apply for this assistance.

We are dedicated to helping ease some of the financial stress and burden caused by the virus.Under the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, FEMA will provide financial assistance for COVID-19-related funeral expenses incurred after January 20, 2020.We are working with stakeholder groups to get their input on ways we can best provide this assistance, and to enlist their help with outreach to families and communities. FEMA will begin to implement COVID-19 funeral assistance in April.

There is no requirement for the deceased person to have been a citizen of the United States. FEMA will also ask for documentation of funeral expenses and‚Äîif applicable‚Äî proof of funds received from other sources.This policy has also heightened fears of inefficiencies and fraud. A Politico report detailed how messy data surrounding the recording of COVID-19 deaths would result in potential challenges.

3740	A photograph shows a skeleton of a Kiwi bird and its unusually large egg.	"On Dec. 9, 2020, a photograph supposedly showing the skeleton of a Kiwi bird and its unusually large egg was shared on social media:We have not been able to source this specific picture, but we have seen similar ones showing models of a kiwi bird skeleton and an egg in its body. The following image, for example, comes from the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. North Island Brown Kiwi, Apteryx mantelli, collected 26 August 1940, Rotorua, New Zealand. CC BY 4.0. Te Papa (OR.016582)The kiwi, a flightless bird about the size of a hen that is native to New Zealand, has one of the largest egg-to-body ratios of any bird. According to the Audubon Society, a kiwi egg can ""can weigh up to a quarter of its body mass.""To put that into perspective, here's an excerpt from a 2017 article from Live Science:[The egg] can be up to 20 percent of her body weight, though, which is comparable to a 120-lb. (54 kg) woman giving birth to a 24-lb. (11 kg) baby, according to the San Diego Zoo. The female lays one to two eggs at a time, up to three times per year.[...]Unlike other birds, chicks kick their eggs open and are covered in feathers as soon as they hatch. They look like tiny versions of their parents. After a few days, the chick will leave the burrow and hang out with dad for around 20 days. After that, they may stay in their parent's territory for a while or trek out to find their own.In addition to producing one of the largest eggs of any bird, the kiwi also has one of the shortest beaks. That might seem like a misstatement, judging by the photos above, but the length of a bird's beak is determined by measuring the distance from its nostrils to the tip of its beak. While most birds' nostrils are close to their heads, the kiwi's nostrils are at the ends of its beak. So, technically speaking, the kiwi has one of the shortest beaks of any birds.¬†Here's a video from the Aukland Zoo about the amazing and unusual kiwi:"	true

What happens to him now - check the comments.""The post said to ""check the comments."" In the comments of the ""sad news"" post, we found a link that went to an article on¬†recipmo.com.

This was an effort to fool people into believing they're reading People.com. In reality, the article was hosted by¬†swopfind.com, electricalpanelparts.com, and perhaps others.As we had seen in the past, any later attempts to refresh the articles showed a different page without the fake People.com article as a way of hiding the scam from prying eyes. This tactic was likely accomplished through the use of an inline frame (iframe).The article claimed that Selleck endorsed a product named Nature's Boost CBD Gummies. However, he has never endorsed any such products. For years, his image and likeness have been used without authorization to sell CBD oil and gummies.To put it simply, Selleck has been a spokesperson before for other products, but he's never had anything to do with CBD gummies. Also, scammers might want to pay attention to the news, as fellow actor Clint Eastwood previously won millions of dollars in two lawsuits against online marketers associated with the CBD industry, which had used his image and likeness without permission.In addition to the Facebook post that led to the misleading CBD gummies article, we also located multiple YouTube videos from 2022 that also pushed the Selleck death hoax.The videos showed titles that claimed he died ""10 minutes ago"" from ""a dangerous incurable disease"" or ""died on the way to the hospital.""

Betts, the suspected shooter, was listed on electoral rolls as having a birth year of 1994 (which comports with Dayton police's confirmation that his age was 24), and was registered to vote in Greene County, Ohio, and took part in elections there since 2012 ‚Äî that is, both before and after the death of Connor D. Betts in Connecticut in 2014.¬†Connor D. Betts and Connor S. Betts did each have a sister named Megan, however they are also two separate individuals. According to Dayton police, Megan Betts was 22 years old when she was shot to death during the Aug. 4 massacre of which her brother is suspected. On the Greene County, Ohio, voter rolls, she was listed as having been born in 1997 and residing at the same address as Connor S. Betts, her brother and the Dayton shooting suspect. Her full name was listed as Megan Kathleen Betts.¬†By contrast, we have cross-referenced news archives and court records and confirmed that the full name of Connor D. Betts' sister is highly likely to be Megan B. Betts, and that she was highly likely to have been born in 1986, not 1997. Each Megan Betts is or was a completely different person, separated by more than a decade in age, and bearing little or no physical resemblance to one another.¬†The third plank of the conspiracy theories was the claim that Connor D. Betts and Connor S. Betts had the same physical appearance, meaning they must have been the same person. Setting aside the fact that Connor D. Betts did in fact die in 2014, and¬†any claims to the contrary were liable to be deeply hurtful to his loved ones, the two men did not look the same.¬†At first glance, some photographs showed a certain passing resemblance between them, but a closer examination revealed that any similarities were no more than superficial. A photographic tribute to Connor D. Betts, posted shortly after his death in 2014, contained dozens of photographs of him. The full scope of those photographs demonstrates clearly that he and Connor S. Betts were completely different individuals.¬†At first glance, the coincidences involved in this conspiracy theory might appear impossibly unlikely to some observers, giving rise to the conclusion that ""something else"" must surely be afoot. In reality, they are not so unlikely at all.According to Social Security Administration (SSA) data, ""Connor"" was the 48th most popular boy's name in Connecticut in 1992 (the year in which Connor D. Betts was born). In 1986, the year in which Megan B. Betts was born, ""Megan"" was the 22nd most popular girl's name in the state. There are therefore lots of Connors and lots of Megans in the state of Connecticut, and the possibility of finding two siblings with those names and respective ages, is much greater than it otherwise would be, due to the popularity of those first names.¬†"	false
6370	In a Jan. 2, 2018, Twitter thread, Chelsea Clinton wished the Church of Satan a Happy New Year.	"Twitter threads sometimes make for strange bedfellows.With more than 2 million followers, Chelsea Clinton¬†certainly qualifies as an experienced tweeter, yet in January 2018 she found herself in the awkward position of having to publicly deny that she's a Satan worshiper¬†‚Äî all because she jumped into a Twitter thread to lend moral support to Chrissy Teigen.¬†Our cautionary tale begins with a 30 December attack on Teigen by a ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theorist bent on implicating the supermodel in an imagined pizza parlor pedophile ring run by and for highly placed Democrats (such as Chelsea Clinton's parents).Teigen found the smear quite disturbing, writing:Alright. I debated saying something about this but I'm pretty disturbed over here. The fact that there are people with these...thoughts...is really scary. pic.twitter.com/9OtWKHxUgR‚Äî christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) December 30, 2017Yeah yeah it's ""just Twitter"" but I'm pretty sure this *sick* person is saying we are darksided pizzagate pedophiles who traffic our daughter. Ummmmm this is really scary shit.‚Äî christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) December 30, 2017
Enter Chelsea Clinton, one of Chrissy Teigen's many Twitter followers. She sent Teigen a message of support and encouragement:Chrissy, sending you & beautiful Luna a huge hug. It is awful & never ok when people threaten or demean any child. I've lost count of the Twitter accounts who've threatened Charlotte with #FGM. While I never bother to report threats against me, I now report every one against her.‚Äî Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) December 31, 2017
Whereupon the thread turned into something of a free-for-all. A random troll using the name ""Rogue Hooters Staff"" (account since deleted) hurled an obscenity at Clinton:Someone who witnessed this exchange notified Hooters (a restaurant chain most notable for the skimpy attire of its female waitstaff and passable wings) of the bogus account, prompting the official (verified) Hooters account to tweet a disavowal, in turn prompting Clinton ‚Äî trust us, this will all make sense as you read through the rest of the thread below¬†‚Äî to tag the Church of Satan:There are two ways to take that last tweet (""It's been so long! Happy New Year!""). One is in the spirit in which it was obviously intended,¬†namely as a jocular, tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the absurdity of sharing a Twitter thread with the likes of @Hooters and @ChurchofSatan.The other is to pretend it might actually mean Clinton is a devil worshiper.A number of scornful tweets went the latter route, stating or implying that Clinton worships Satan. One example (since deleted) said, ""At least @ChelseaClinton is open about worshiping #Satan. #ChurchOfSatan If only @HillaryClinton could be as honest.""Clinton replied with what amounted to a denial:Oh goodness gracious. We can be civil, cheerful, respectful to & friends with people who don't share our religious beliefs. Sometimes, we even marry them. I'm a Methodist & my husband is Jewish, thank you for asking. A very happy New Year to you Rhonda! https://t.co/8UH9SP8EWO‚Äî Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 3, 2018
However, the reminder that she, like her mother, is a lifelong Methodist failed to hush that rather large subset of the Twitterverse devoted to spreading Clinton hatred.A former vice presidential candidate chimed in, along with others:Nope. Sadly, this is not a joke. https://t.co/74OU4tElX5‚Äî Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) January 4, 2018If you have to deny worshiping Satan, you more than likely worship Satan. #QAnon #PizzaGate #FollowTheWhiteRabbit #Pedogate https://t.co/BeLBU9ECPu‚Äî JT - MAGA ???‚ò†Ô∏è (@jt_maga) January 4, 2018Chelsea upside cross sways pics for years and all, thst Chrissy who goes to spirit cooking and your mom too; just talking to these people Church of Satan and owl people is too much! #sickclubofpedos #PEDOgate #QANON #FOLLOWTHEWHITERABBIT #THESTORM pic.twitter.com/Pmm69AnmIj‚Äî (Jamie)J.A.L.F.T (@jametteriley) January 3, 2018@ChelseaClinton Like mother like daughter.

We can't help but note the concerted effort to plug Chelsea Clinton's alleged Satanic sympathies into pre-existing narratives impugning the entire Clinton family.Consider the recurring hashtags in the tweets on this subject, which include #QAnon, #Pizzagate, #FollowTheWhiteRabbit and #Pedogate. In certain circles these signify conspiracy theories¬†accusing the Clinton family of all manner of ""deep-state"" shenanigans, from assassination plots to election rigging to pedophile rings.Some of the critical tweets allude to something called ""spirit cooking."" This refers to a series of performance art events mentioned in WikiLeaks e-mails, which were pounced upon by conspiracy theorists as proof that the Clintons and their inner circle practice occult rituals (although in reality it was nothing of the kind).Others revisit low-resolution¬†images¬†floating around the Internet for years allegedly showing Chelsea Clinton wearing a necklace with an ""inverted"" or ""upside-down"" cross ‚Äî supposedly a sign of Satan worship. When we asked a Clinton spokesperson about it, however, we were told that she owns no such piece of jewelry. Clinton occasionally wears a Greek (equal-sided) cross that could conceivably be mistaken for (or manipulated in images to look like) an inverted one.¬†We asked the spokesperson, point-blank, if Chelsea Clinton is a Satan worshiper. The answer, unsurprisingly, was no. The spokesperson confirmed that Clinton is a Methodist, and could in fact be found¬†as recently as New Year's Eve 2018 attending her non-Satanic Methodist church services in New York City.We also checked in with a representative of the Church of Satan, the Rev. Raul Antony, who confirmed an important piece of background information, namely that prior to the Chrissy Teigen Twitter thread there had never been any direct contact between Chelsea Clinton and the Church of Satan. As Clinton said in one of her tweets, ""In 2017, @ChurchofSatan & I were put on a few threads together."" Antony told us they were tagged into those threads by Pizzagate conspiracy theorists.We asked him to address the widespread assumption that members of the Church of Satan‚Äîwhich, to be clear, is a 50-year-old organization distinct from all other groups and individuals purporting to identify themselves as ""Satanic""‚Äîactually worship the devil.¬†""No,"" he said. ""We reject all theism and recognize all gods and religions [including Satan] to be man-made social institutions. Still, we find symbols and religion to be an important part of the human experience and embrace the symbol of Satan as the representation of carnality, individualism, and rational self-interest.""We thought we might as well ask him if Chelsea Clinton is a Satanist."	true
2949	The CDC is a private, nonprofit corporation.	"While there are legitimate concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest between corporations donating to the CDC directly and indirectly, the author of a viral claim confuses a government agency (the CDC) with an independent 501(c)(3) public charity (the CDC Foundation). The Foundation is independent of the U.S. government and the former's contributions to the CDC make up a proportionally small amount of its overall budget. Since November 2020, an identically worded bit of text alleging that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ""is a private nonprofit corporation"" has been shared across multiple social media platforms. The claim has its origins on the website Armstrong Economics ‚Äî which sells a variety of self-published conspiracy books by the titular Martin Armstrong ‚Äî and would become a well-shared bit of copy-and-paste ""copypasta,"" reproduced in part below:Did you know the CDC is a private nonprofit corporation? [...]The CDC is quasi-government under the Department of Health and Human Services which strangely has sources of funding that are predicated on the fact that it also has a private 501(c)(3) public charity, like the Clinton Foundation.The CDC Foundation receives charitable contributions and philanthropic grants from individuals, foundations, corporations, universities, NGOs and other organizations to advance the work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.This is NOT a government-funded organization. It is not exclusively a government-funded [sic] ‚Äì very curious.Natural News, which boasts a massive audience of conspiracy theorists, republished it in December 2020. At the time of this writing, versions of this copypasta still creep up on various social media platforms. On May 3, 2021, a Facebook account named The Daily Callout published it along with a picture of purported CDC funding sources. Commenters to that post were evidently confused:The allegations leveled against the CDC are not all that coherent in these posts. The copypasta suggests the CDC is both a non-profit and a ""quasi-government"" agency. Further, those issues are tangled up in the separate issue of corporate donations to the CDC. The title of the post, however, provides Snopes with a clearly stated contention: ""Did you know the CDC is a private nonprofit corporation?"" You most likely did not know this, because it is, in fact, not true.The CDC is a federal agency housed in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The confusion stems from the fact that, in 1992, Congress mandated the creation of a non-profit foundation ‚Äî the CDC Foundation ‚Äî that would ""not be an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government"" and whose purpose would be ""to support and carry out activities for the prevention and control of diseases, disorders, injuries, and disabilities, and for promotion of public health."" As part of that goal, the foundation has an endowment and accepts charitable gifts from a variety of entities, including corporations, which are forwarded to the CDC to support specific initiatives.¬†""The government has unique capacities as well as limitations. The same is true for the private and philanthropic sectors,"" the CDC Foundation argues on its website. ""We believe that people, groups and organizations have greater positive impact and can accomplish more collectively than individually."" Funds raised by the CDC foundation are donated to various programs and initiatives within the CDC.The CDC Foundation is one of two ways corporations can legally provide funds to the CDC. Donations to the CDC foundation are an indirect route as, by law, ""officers, employees, and members of the board of the Foundation shall not be officers or employees of the Federal Government."" Direct gifts by corporations to the CDC are also allowed under a portion of the U.S. Code that authorizes the secretary of HHS ""to accept on behalf of the United States gifts made ... for the benefit of the Service or for the carrying out of any of its functions.""For both direct gifts to the CDC and gifts made via the CDC Foundation, conditional funding is allowed so long as those requirements are not, as outlined in CDC policy documents:The acceptance of corporate donations earmarked for specific causes ‚Äî both to the CDC Foundation and to the CDC itself ‚Äî have caused apparent conflicts of interest. In 2015, the medical journal BMJ published an editorial outlining several examples of potential conflicts, including these examples:In 2010, the CDC, in conjunction with the CDC Foundation, formed the Viral Hepatitis Action Coalition, which supports research and promotes expanded testing and treatment of hepatitis C in the United States and globally. Industry has donated over $26m to the coalition through the CDC Foundation since 2010. Corporate members of the coalition include Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie, Gilead, Janssen, Merck, OraSure Technologies, Quest Diagnostics, and Siemens‚Äîeach of which produces products to test for or treat hepatitis C infection. [...]In 2012, [a company named] Genentech earmarked $600,000 in donations to the CDC Foundation for CDC‚Äôs efforts to promote expanded testing and treatment of viral hepatitis. Genentech and its parent company, Roche, manufacture test kits and treatments for hepatitis C.The CDC argues that it has policies in place to prevent such conflicts. Its website states that ""when we engage with the private sector ‚Ä¶ we maintain our scientific integrity by participating in a gift review process that is rigorous and transparent. CDC‚Äôs gift acceptance policy requires a comprehensive gift review prior to accepting a gift. This includes CDC Foundation (CDCF) gifts and gifts given directly to [the] CDC, whether they are monetary or non-monetary."" These processes have been refined and standardized several times since 2014.While the issue of potential corporate influence over public health policy merits scrutiny, it is also important to consider the scale of private funding compared to the overall congressionally appropriated budget of the CDC. In the 2020 fiscal year, the CDC received $13 million in conditional gifts from the CDC Foundation and $10 million in conditional and unconditional direct contributions from the private sector. This is a drop in the bucket compared to the nearly $8 billion in funding the CDC receives from Congress:"	false

4167	"A WhatsApp video message known as ""Argentina Is Doing It"" spreads malware that irreparably hacks viewers' cell phones."	"In July 2020, WhatsApp users reported receiving a message that claimed a video on the platform titled ""Argentina is doing it"" was spreading malware that would hack the cell phones of people who received the media file. The warning alert looked like this:The warning alert makes several assertions: that video footage detailing Argentina's response to the coronavirus pandemic was going to start circulating online; that that video file would irreparably compromise information on viewers cell phones in 10 seconds, and that the national news outlet, CNN, had reported on the malware scheme and/or the video about Argentina.By July 16, cautionary messages about the alleged file were spreading on Twitter, as well. Numerous Snopes readers requested that we investigate the warning alert and purported video.¬†The warning ‚Äî like similarly-worded messages that have circulated on WhatsApp in recent years ‚Äî appeared to be a hoax.First, we looked for evidence of the alleged video about the South American country's response to the pandemic, and whether that footage had been spreading a virus that hacks people's phones.Meanwhile, we contacted CNN to determine the legitimacy of the claim that the news outlet had reported on the scheme, or the ""Argentina is doing it"" video. Blair Cofield, a CNN spokesperson, said in an email to Snopes: ""This is false. There is nothing on CNN platforms with that message.""In sum, it appeared that no one online actually saw or received a link to the ""Argentina is doing it"" video, per our analysis.Additionally, we searched for details to explain the extent to which the scheme removed or stole recipients' cell information, and the underlying motivation behind the warning message. We found no evidence to explain the cell operating system on which the malware runs.On a web page to explain the platform's privacy and security issues, WhatsApp says such messages that aim to deceive users often contain instructions to forward the message (""Pass the information on to your family and friends"") and claim you can avoid punishment (getting your phone hacked) if you act in a certain way. The ""Argentina is doing it"" message checked both those¬† boxes.The WhatsApp page goes on to say people should disregard such messages, and ""to avoid exposing your contacts to potential harm, please never forward these messages to them."" A cybersecurity writer for Forbes wrote in March 2020:""These hoax WhatsApp messages are the modern equivalent of the old chain letter that urged the reader to send copies on to ten people, or something terrible would happen to them. ... the real problem with this kind of hoax messaging that goes viral is that it can then turn into what it purports to be: a malware distribution tool.""Given the fact that no evidence shows that the ""Argentina is doing it"" video exists, nor that it is part of a malware scheme to hack cell phones ‚Äî as well as the similarities in language between this viral message and previous WhatsApp hoaxes ‚Äî we rate this claim ""False."""	false
5252	"U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke once said he would like to throw elderly people and wounded veterans ""in the garbage."""	"In late 2018 and early 2019, U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke emerged as a popular early choice among Democrats considering their party's potential presidential candidate in 2020.The Texas Congressman gained national prominence during 2018 when he came unexpectedly close to unseating incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and winning what would have been an historically rare Democrat victory in a state-wide election in Texas.As his campaign gained momentum, O'Rourke became the subject of intense nationwide scrutiny and even misinformation, some of which we cataloged previously.At the turn of the year, as focus in political circles shifted to the likely Democratic presidential contenders for 2020, a meme emerged on social media which attributed an inflammatory and highly damaging quotation to O'Rourke: ""If I could throw two kinds of people in the garbage it would be the elderly and wounded veterans. When a tool breaks you don't fix it, you throw it in the damn trash.""The quotation was fabricated: O'Rourke has never uttered or written the words attributed to him in the meme, nor did he ever express a similar sentiment to the effect that he regarded old people and veterans as non-functioning tools which should be discarded. A search of news archives, Congressional records and O'Rourke's 2018 campaign web site failed to reveal any such remarks (which would have drawn national attention had he made them).On his campaign web site, O'Rourke laid out his policy positions on the two groups in question. Of veterans, he said that ""Our veterans should receive the care and dignity they have earned. That begins with ensuring that every veteran can receive access to quality healthcare, timely resolutions to their disability claims and appeals, and sustainable housing.""Of seniors, O'Rourke wrote that ""Texas seniors have built the families, communities, and businesses we now enjoy.

52	The JR-15 is a real, scaled-down rifle designed to be ‚Äúsafe and instructive‚Äù for children.	"As 2023 began with a number of harrowing stories about children shooting themselves or others due to their access to guns, one company was¬†selling a rifle that they said was ""safe and instructive"" for children. The JR-15 is a real rifle for children that was introduced in 2022 by the Wee1 Tactical firearm company.¬†It generated a lot of controversy when it first came out, including comments from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who criticized the marketing, which included a skull-and-crossbones design with a pacifier.At the 2022 Shot Show, a trade event for gun enthusiasts held in Las Vegas, the Wee1 Tactical vendor stall showcased the JR-15. Eric Schmid, who was described as the owner of Wee1, touted it as a ""scaled down AR-15."" The stall at that time still had skull and crossbones-style logos, with what appeared to be a little boy skull wearing a mohawk and with an eyepatch and green pacifier, and a little girl skull with pigtails, eyepatch, and pink pacifier.¬†In a ""Product Spotlight"" video, Schmid spent most of the video showing how the safety mechanisms worked on the rifle, and described the logo as ""cool,"" saying ""that keeps the wow factor with the kids.""There are no baby skulls in more recent marketing, but the JR-15 is currently (as of early 2023) being advertised with a specific focus on safety. In a publicity flyer shared by the Violence Policy Center, the company states:Safety was so much at the forefront of our thought process that we developed and patented a tamper resistant safety that puts the adult in control of the firearms safety switch. The switch itself requires strength and dexterity to release. When this is engaged, the standard safety switch on the rifle cannot be released. Thus, adding a level of safety found on no other firearm of any size. Always remember that the most important safety feature of any youth firearm is the adult supervising all activity.¬†The flyer even features a picture of a child holding a rifle, aided by an adult. On its website, the JR-15 is advertised as a ""small piece of American freedom"":Since our nation's founding, families have passed on a love for hunting and shooting sports from one generation to another. Parents and guardians wishing to preserve this tradition have taken the responsibility for introducing children to the safe, responsible use of firearms. The JR-15, a 22LR sporting rifle, is designed to facilitate that, making a young person's first shooting experiences safe and instructive.We are excited and honored to provide a quality product that will assist families in safely passing on the proud American tradition of responsible gun ownership to the next generation of recreational shooting and hunting enthusiasts.Vice News pointed out that while the JR-15 is geared toward hunting small game and marksmanship, its look is similar to that of an AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle that has been used in mass shootings. Wee1 Tactical's website also notes that the JR-15 has ""blow-back semi-automatic action."" It also states that the weapon has no common parts with the AR, but ""AR-platform accessories, such as sights, can be used.""

5661	San Juan mayor Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz was arrested for misusing federal disaster relief funds.	"Weeks after fact checkers debunked false reports that San Juan mayor Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz had been arrested for misappropriating $3 million in disaster relief funds intended for the victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, the rumor continued to spread on social media.On 15 July 2018, the junk news web site Your News Wire published a story headlined ""Puerto Rico Mayor Facing Fraud Charges Over $3M in Federal Disaster Relief"" which featured a photograph of Mayor Yul√≠n Cruz wearing a t-shirt that read ""Nasty"" -- a reference to President Donald Trump's criticism of his 2016 presidential rival Hillary Clinton. Days later, fact checkers debunked the story, pointing out that a different Puerto Rican mayor, Miguel G. Ortiz-V√©lez of the municipality Sabana Grande, was the one who had been  indicted by the Justice Department, not Yul√≠n Cruz.Despite the fact the story was debunked almost as soon as it was published, versions of it continued to spread online in the following weeks. Many sites employed vague wording, apparently banking on the (apparently correct) assumption that readers would automatically assume the ""Puerto Rico mayor"" in question was Yul√≠n Cruz, who regularly locked horns with President Trump over his administration's handling of Hurricane Maria, which had devastated Puerto Rico one year earlier.On the one-year anniversary of that event, the false story reporting Yul√≠n Cruz had been arrested for corruption involving disaster relief funds again gained steam, with social media users posting YouTube videos containing misleading information. One such video was posted on 17 July 2018 by The Next News Network, a YouTube channel cooked up to look like a legitimate newscast while boasting of its intent of ""Triggering SNOWFLAKES with Top CONSERVATIVE news published daily.""The video led in with the introduction, ""A Puerto Rican mayor getting busted on fraud charges for stealing over $3 million in federal funds"" while displaying an image of Yul√≠n Cruz alongside a photograph of federal agents who appeared to be in the midst of carrying out a search warrant. The hosts then complained at length about negative news stories blaming President Trump for the hurricane's devastation and lobbed criticism at Yul√≠n Cruz for wearing a t-shirt that said ""nasty"" on the front during a television interview, before finally landing at the 3-minute mark with an Associated Press report that correctly identified Ortiz-V√©lez, not Yul√≠n Cruz, as the indicted mayor:We reached out to The Next News Network, as well as producer Brian D. Roberts via social media but did not receive a response.Meanwhile a YouTube spokesperson pointed out the platform was working to prioritize legitimate news sources and pointed out that searches for Yul√≠n Cruz's name turned up links to legitimate news and entertainment sources:We're continuously working to better surface and promote news and authoritative sources to make the best possible information available to YouTube viewers. Since 2017, we‚Äôve been introducing a number of ways to improve access to authoritative information, including creating a ‚ÄúBreaking News‚Äù shelf on the YouTube homepage and ‚ÄúTop News‚Äù shelf in search that serves up content from reliable news sources after a major event, and just last month we announced further steps. This work is still in its early stages, but as these tools start to apply more widely across YouTube, we believe they will make authoritative content readily available.We reached out to Facebook and Twitter, where links to similar misleading stories were also posted, but have not yet received a response.Hurricane Maria, a category 4 hurricane, made landfall on Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, on 20 September 2017. Since then President Trump and his supporters have repeatedly denigrated Yul√≠n Cruz for her vocal criticism of the administration's lack of intervention for the types of infrastructure failures that lead to preventable deaths in the aftermath of the storm. On 12 September 2018 for example, President Trump took a swipe at Yul√≠n Cruz while boasting about the federal government's response to the disaster and touting readiness for Hurricane Florence, which hit the U.S. East Coast in mid-September 2018:We got A Pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida (and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico, even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan).

The day prior, Trump retweeted a post by QAnon supporter @MajorPatriot that included the doctored photo of Barrett and false claims alleging a nefarious illegal scheme by Trump's political opponents to undermine his 2020 reelection campaign. That original post read:""The wheels are coming off. Trump's inspired massive MAGA tsunami turnout forced them to cheat so big they lost their minds in a fraud frenzy. Their Unconstitutional legal moves alone are dooming them.""More than five hours later, Trump shared the post by @MajorPatriot, according to Snopes' analysis of the president's Twitter activity.

3630	Walmart employees were caught hiding PS5s to keep the video game consoles for themselves.	"In November 2020, Sony released the newest in the line of PlayStation consoles: PlayStation 5 (PS5). But shoppers had a hard time finding a PS5 because of shortages and scalpers who used ""sophisticated bots"" to quickly buy up any stock. Meanwhile, Google searches for PS5 availability at Walmart trended in November and December 2020, following the Nov. 12, 2020, release date.So when we came across TikTok videos that purported to show Walmart employees ""trying 2 stash"" away PS5s for themselves, we decided to take a closer look.The videos were posted by TikTok user @skitdaddle_420. He claimed to find a ""stash"" of PS5s that were hidden away by Walmart employees in what appeared to be the store's garden section. We were unable to confirm the Walmart location where the videos were recorded. The first video had been viewed more than 269,000 times: A second video showed a cage with multiple PS5 consoles and accessories locked inside: However, the TikTok videos did not show that Walmart employees had ""stashed"" a bunch of PS5 consoles for themselves. All of the boxes visible in the second video were marked with names and either ""pickup"" or ""delivery,"" because they were already purchased. At the end of the first video, an unidentified person told @skitdaddle_420: ""These are for people who ordered them online."" This meant they were likely preorders or online orders.As for the scalper problem that had plagued the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series S and X, Chicago Tribune reported it could threaten the platform's longterm success:A console‚Äôs debut is supposed to set off a virtuous cycle of consumers rushing to buy the devices, while developers release games that capitalize on new graphics and processor capabilities, sending demand on both sides surging. Sony risks suffering the opposite.‚ÄúThe PlayStation 5 could miss a critical chance to get into a good hardware-software upward spiral,‚Äù said Kazunori Ito of Morningstar Research. ‚ÄúThe peak of the platform will likely be low and the platform‚Äôs total revenue earned won‚Äôt be as strong as we hoped for.‚ÄùScalpers deploy bots that constantly monitor online stores for changes in inventory and supplies, then automatically place orders and check out in seconds when devices become available. The technique is based on familiar web-crawling or scraping technology, but is specifically tailored for e-commerce and can sometimes jump to the front of order queues.Walmart published a blog post about what it calls ""grinch bots"" and called on lawmakers to help with the problem:We have more next-gen consoles coming online soon, and we‚Äôre continuing to work hard to get them into the hands of as many customers as possible. We hope others across the retail industry will join us by asking lawmakers to do more to prevent these unwanted bots on retail sites, so customers have equal access to the products they want."	false
3826	"Joe Biden won key states in the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to fraudulent late-night ""vote dumps."""	"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.One of the many claims U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters made in flailing attempts to reverse Trump's defeat by Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the 2020 general election was the assertion that furtive late-night ""dumps"" of illicit ballots had taken place, which wiped out large Trump leads and gave Biden wins in key battleground states:Not only did the ""data dumps"" have nothing fraudulent about them, but they were in fact predictable and had been anticipated well in advance of the election.As we discussed in a separate article, heavy use of mail-in ballots was expected in the election due to the COVID-19 pandemic that made in-person voting risky. Many pre-election discussions noted that the increased use of mail-in ballots could misleadingly skew the early reporting of election results towards one candidate or the other in some states, depending on when those states tabulated their mail-in ballots:Even once the early and in-person ballots are counted, a significant number of votes could still be outstanding. Only nine states expect to have at least 98 percent of unofficial results reported by noon the day after the election.The order in which different types of votes are reported could also make one party look stronger at various points in the night. Democrats are more likely to vote by mail this year, so in states where those will be the first type of ballots released, like Arizona, Florida and North Carolina, initial results could skew in favor of Joseph R. Biden Jr. Places that report in-person Election Day votes first, like most parts of Virginia, will probably look better for President Trump.But the initial skew in a state‚Äôs results may last only a short while, and it will be influenced by which counties or precincts in the state are the fastest to report ...Moreover, this phenomenon was precisely expected to take place in states that were not allowed (by their own laws) to begin counting mail-in ballots as they were received, but instead had to wait until Election Day or just beforehand ‚Äî particularly in the key states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, whose results Trump most vociferously disputed:Voters are casting ballots early in record numbers this year amid the pandemic ‚Äî and that‚Äôs prompting concerns that it might wind up taking longer than expected to get election results, as officials process millions more mail-in ballots than usual.The reality is that most states can begin processing absentee ballots in some form before Election Day, which could help avoid delays in reporting results.But in three critical battleground states ‚Äî Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan ‚Äî officials aren‚Äôt allowed to start processing early ballots until on or just before Election Day itself, which could delay not just their state results but also, if the Electoral College count is close, potentially leave the whole presidential race up in the air.The ""vote spikes"" that Trump and his supporters maintain are indicative of election fraud were merely an unsurprising combination of mail-in ballots (which were more heavily used by Democrats) and ballots from areas that vote heavily Democratic. That Trump may have held a lead in early returns reported from these states is irrelevant, akin to claiming that the score at halftime in a football game is more significant than the final result.In terms of conspiracy theory, this claim runs afoul of some major plot holes, including that:1) It posits that forces working in favor of Democratic candidate Biden were sufficiently powerful, knowledgeable, and widespread to overturn the legitimate election results, yet they couldn't manage to do so in a manner that wasn't clumsy and blatantly obvious."	false
2378	Two friends found pipes in the woods that led to something found underneath.	"It's true that pipes sticking out of the ground in the woods led to two friends finding and exploring an old bunker in northern Germany. An Imgur user posted a photo album about the matter in 2014. However, we recommend avoiding online display ads that promote the story. The ads led to a dramatized version of the tale with fictitious character names.Since at least December 2021, online advertisements have claimed: ""These Pipes Were Sticking Out of the Ground, This Is What Was Underneath."" Upon further inspection, they led to a 69-page slideshow article about two friends and the urban exploration of an underground bunker in northern Germany. The core plot elements were true. However, the seemingly endless article used fictitious names like ""Mike Peter"" and ""Dale Hufford,"" and appeared to dramatize the otherwise true story. Additionally, we also found YouTube videos titled: ""Two Guys Noticed These Pipes Sticking Out of the Ground.""One of the ads misleadingly showed a completely unrelated picture of two men exploring a field with what may have resembled pipes above the ground: This photograph had nothing to do with the real story.In reality, however, this picture did not show pipes. A red tape dispenser was visible on the ground that was used to mark off various sections of the land. The context of the photograph was that the men were using ""ground-penetrating radar to inspect an area"" in an attempt to find ""a Nazi train carrying gold and diamonds [that] was buried in Poland at the end of the Second World War."" (Spoiler alert: They never found it.)Here's the full-size image: Experts use Ground-penetrating radar to inspect an area where a World War II Nazi train is supposed to be hidden on November 10, 2015 in Walbrzych, Poland.

It began by mentioning pipes that were sticking out of the ground and ended with the tale of something found underneath, just as teased by the ads.Here are six highlights from the full Imgur album. (We have made corrections on some of the grammar, as English was not this person's first language.)So when visiting an old friend in northern Germany (formerly GDR), he told me about these weird periscope like pipes in the woods. They often played there as kids and knew about the bunkers below, but never were allowed to get near them. Last week, we decided to check them out and this is our report. (Sorry for my bad English, I'm trying my best.) The pipes. (Courtesy: hellomynameisthatthingfromthewalls/Imgur.com)It was not very hard to find, circa a hundred meters from the periscopes, and surrounded by coniferous trees. It was covered with a wooden lid that was easy to remove by crowbar. The entrance.

The acoustics were, in a word, haunting. ""Endless"" hallways. (Courtesy: hellomynameisthatthingfromthewalls/Imgur.com)Proceeding onwards, the graffiti clearly read, ""Hello Satan, I love you."" Not something you want to read down there. The smell at this point turned out to be really bad, like rotten organic stuff and old water. Sewer-like, if you will. The Satan sign. (Courtesy: hellomynameisthatthingfromthewalls/Imgur.com)This was the first time on the whole tour that I literally panicked. Terrified by the silhouette of this pile of rubbish, resembling a crouching or sitting man, I screamed and nearly knocked over my friend. My bad... he was scared to death as well. The pile of ""rubbish."" (Courtesy: hellomynameisthatthingfromthewalls/Imgur.com)When already heading back to where we came from, my friend found this spooky gem. It was the biggest room so far, but only visible through little square holes in the walls, like tiny crenels. So he put his camera through and took this sweet shot of a weird, big machine. The ""machine."" (Courtesy: hellomynameisthatthingfromthewalls/Imgur.com)The user ended the slideshow of 30+ photos in the album by writing: ""Nonetheless, it was the spookiest trip of my life.""According to comments from a Reddit post, it might have been an old Soviet bunker from the Cold War. The name and exact location of the bunker in northern Germany were not provided. However, we did find additional resources for any readers who might be interested in learning more."	true

In April 2020, various cities in the United States saw protests against shelter-in-place orders that were enacted to combat the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. Several photographs and videos showed these protests, but one image in particular went viral after it was likened to a scene from the zombie comedy ""Shaun of the Dead.""The top half of the image is a real photograph taken on April 13 by Joshua A. Bickel of The Columbus Dispatch and shows protesters outside of the Ohio Statehouse demonstrating against the state's self-quarantine rules.It was originally published in an article entitled ""GOP lawmakers, protesters call on DeWine to begin re-opening Ohio.""That article started:Some Republicans in the Ohio legislature are publicly calling on Gov. Mike DeWine to consider removing coronavirus-related restrictions beginning next month, while on Monday, around 100 protesters gathered outside the Statehouse during Dewine‚Äôs daily COVID-19 press briefing.A growing chorus of Ohio‚Äôs Republican lawmakers want Gov.

This photograph was presented in that article with the following caption:Protesters stand outside the Statehouse Atrium where reporters listen during the State of Ohio's Coronavirus response update on Monday, April 13, 2020 at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. About 100 protesters assembled outside the building during Gov. Mike DeWine's weekday update on the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, upset that the state remains under a Stay-At-Home order and that non-essential businesses remain closed.While Bickel's photograph was taken on April 13 in Ohio, it truly went viral later a few days later when a similar (but larger) protest dubbed ""Operation Gridlock"" took place in Michigan and made national headlines. That protest featured hundreds of Michiganders outside of the state's Capitol demanding an end to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home orders.¬†Whitmer said that the protest in Michigan,¬†which featured American flags, Trump flags, Confederate flags, and a number of heavily armed protesters, was just as much about partisan politics as it was about public health.Whitmer said:It really wasn't about the stay-at-home order at all. [...] It was essentially a political rally, a political statement that flies in the face of all of the science, all the best practices. [...] It looks like a lot of people and it felt like a lot of people but in the bigger scheme of things, Michigan is a state of 10 million people, the vast majority of whom are doing the right thing. Our hospitals have stepped up, our nurses, our doctors, the average citizen whose staying home or is contributing in some way to help people on the front line. That's the story of what's really going on here.This group, a small group of people that came together without masks on, who were passing out candy with bare hands to children, who were congregating together, who were brandishing their weapons, who were having posters of being anti-choice; this was a political rally, it was a political rally that is going to endanger people's lives, because this is precisely how Covid-19 spreads."	true
4801	During an October 2019 press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed the U.S. and Italy had been allies for thousands of years.	In October 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs public appearances with his Italian counterpart, Sergio Mattarella, prompted readers to inquire about two viral claims. One was whether the president had flubbed the pronunciation of the Italian president's name.Others claimed that Trump had said the United States and Italy had been allies since the era of ancient Rome.But Trump never actually claimed that.It would clearly be wrong because the U.S. was only founded as an independent nation in 1776, and Italy was only unified in the 19th century, becoming a republic in the 1940s.What Trump actually said, in his opening remarks during the press conference, was as follows:‚ÄúThe United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years, to ancient Rome ‚Ä¶‚ÄùTrump said the two countries share a political and cultural heritage, and that that heritage dates back thousands of years. He did not claim that the two countries have shared an alliance for thousands of years ‚Äî something that would have required both nations to exist as polities during the era of the Roman Empire, which clearly neither did.The phrase ‚Äúdating back thousands of years‚Äù evidently caused many commentators to misunderstand the meaning of Trump‚Äôs remarks. But it‚Äôs the heritage that goes back that far, not the binding of the two nations.The influence of the Roman Republic on the formation and principles of the American Republic is well-documented, and Trump‚Äôs point was historically sound.See for yourself:	false
333	Following the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka Dam on June 6, 2023, animals trapped at a zoo just downstream from the incident drowned.	"Initial reports suggesting ""all"" of the animals (around 300) drowned did not account for some animals that had previously been transferred to the care of zoo workers. The exact number of animals killed is unclear, but Russian claims denying that any animal died ‚Äî or that no zoo existed in the first place ‚Äî are false. Early on the morning of June 6, 2023, at around the time residents reported hearing explosions, the Nova Kakhovka Dam in the Kherson region of Ukraine failed, leading to catastrophic flooding in several downstream towns and cities. Ukrainian authorities have blamed Russia for the collapse. Russian authorities have denied involvement, blaming Kyiv.¬†The city of Nova Kakhovka, directly below the dam, experienced extreme flooding shortly after its failure. As images of the town's administrative center under several feet of water went viral, claims soon emerged that a large portion of a local zoo's animal population had perished in the floodwaters.¬†These reports concern ""a recreation complex for children and adults"" named Kazkova Dibrova ‚Äî which roughly translates to Fairytale Dibrova ‚Äî that contained, along with sculptures and other attractions, a small zoo. On the morning of the dam's failure, the Facebook page of that park reported the death of its animal population:This morning, the recreation complex ""Kazkova Dibrova"" was completely flooded with water after the explosion of the Russian Kakhovskaya HPP. About 300 animals that our Novokakhov residents knew and loved died.¬†Monkeys Anfisa and Charlik, pony Malysh, donkey Osya, raccoons Mishka, Lolya, Dinka, parrot Venya, crow Roma, marmots, Cameroonian goats, sheep, parrots, guinea pigs, ferrets and many other small pets of ours. Only a couple of swans and ducks survived. A small swan chick, born only 5 days ago, also died. Already at 6 in the morning, when Dibrova's workers arrived, everything was flooded with water.A video shared on Telegram appeared to show the park as workers arrived that morning. While Snopes can verify that these videos showed¬†the entrance of the Kazkova Dibrova, we cannot independently confirm the time when the video was filmed:As viral headlines reported that ""300 zoo animals drown in floodwaters,"" Russian media was quick to deny any aspect of the claim whatsoever, asserting in the English language version of the state-owned news agency TASS that the story couldn't be true because there was no zoo in the town:Ukrainian media reports about animals who were killed by a flood at a zoo in the city of Novaya Kakhovka are untrue, because the city has no zoo at all, a spokesperson for the city's emergencies services has told TASS.""Earlier, the Ukrainian media reported that beavers, swans and dogs were killed in Novaya Kakhovka. Some media said that a zoo with around 300 animals was allegedly flooded,"" the spokesperson said. ""No animals were killed, because our city has no zoo.""As tourist guides and years of Instagram and other social media posts predating the war can attest, Kazkova Dibrova is a real place with a real zoo that was, indeed, a home to the animals described in the zoo's viral Facebook post. The park has been around since 1992, and is only meters away from the administrative center that flooded in the immediate wake of the dam collapse.¬† (Bing Maps / Snopes)Russian language editions of TASS later reported a slightly narrower denial that accepted the existence of a zoo in Novo Kakhovka (via Google Translate):All animals from the zoo in the city of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region were taken out last year, Mayor Vladimir Leontiev told reporters.""Even last year, all the animals from the Kazkova Dibrova Zoo were evacuated and transported, there was no one left, not a single animal. Volunteers took custody of these animals,"" he said.According to a TASS correspondent, now it is impossible to get to the place where the zoo was previously located due to the fact that it is flooded. This area is cordoned off for security purposes.Employees and volunteers associated with the zoo deny that narrative, but they did state that their earlier assertion that all the animals perished failed to account for the fact that some animals had been in the care of volunteers. As explained on the park's Facebook page:The information on the animals of Kazkova Dibrova, which were saved, is being clarified. Yesterday, the workers, being in a state of shock, gave me inaccurate information. Some animals were not on the territory of Dibrova, but were at home [with a volunteer] That's why they stayed alive! Our favorite parrot Venya, flying squirrels, ferrets, parrots, chinchillas and guinea pigs are protected from the flood.Volunteers had been working to keep many of the animals alive during the war. ""A year back, we all raised funds as a group to buy feed for the year. Farmers, entrepreneurs, and many people helped by bringing vegetables and sending money to help animals,"" the park wrote on Facebook. Two volunteers, according to the zoo, had been risking their lives and taken fire in an effort to feed the animals as fighting intensified.Some animals were, indeed, brought to zoo employees' homes during the winter, but ‚Äî the zoo said ‚Äî- these had been returned to the park. ""Dibrova survived a terrible winter without light and heating,"" the park's Facebook page wrote, explaining that their park director ""took home all the warm-loving animals"" before they were ""returned back to Dibrova.""¬†The assertion that there were no animals at all present at the zoo at the time of the flooding is hard to support. For one thing, one of the earliest viral images of post-dam-collapse flooding showed two swans ‚Äî matching the description swans from the zoo next door ‚Äî swimming in front of the Novo Khakovka administrative center:¬†The struggle posed by mines and shelling made the full-scale evacuation of all the animals impossible, zoo officials said. These assertions are supported by posts on Facebook by the zoo in late 2022."	true
5960	Whistleblower Christopher Wylie's Facebook account was suspended after he came forward with allegations that Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users' profile data.	On 16 March 2018, the social media company Facebook announced it would suspend psychographics firms Cambridge Analytica and its parent company SCL Group along with whistleblower Christopher Wylie and psychologist Aleksandr Kogan from its platform in the wake of a massive privacy scandal.Although the Silicon Valley firm's officials made the announcement via Facebook's official channels, some readers questioned whether it was true that Wylie's account was suspended in response to his decision to come forward; it is.Wylie went public in mid-March 2018 with revelations that Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired data from millions of Facebook users, and then used that information to psychologically profile people in an attempt to manipulate the 2016 election; their services had been retained by Donald Trump's campaign, he said.According to Facebook's official statement, the suspensions came after the company learned that Kogan, a Cambridge University researcher had taken data collected from an app that allowed users to take a personality quiz. Instead of using it for academic purposes, as he claimed, Kogan passed it on to Cambrdige Analytica.Facebook learned about the transaction in 2015 and removed the app for violating platform policies, then suspended the accounts of those involved in the unraveling scandal in March 2018, once the breach became public knowledge and the company learned that Cambridge Analytica did not delete the information it had taken:Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.Wylie disputes Facebook's story, however, tweeting that he was suspended because of the backlash ‚Äî not because Facebook was made aware of new information:Suspended by @facebook.

4644	The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in the United States and South Korea on the same day.	In March 2020, as the daily rate of new cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease was increasing in the United States and decreasing in South Korea, a message started to circulate on social media claiming that these two countries had seen their first confirmed cases of infection by the novel coronavirus on the same day:South Korea and the United States did indeed confirm their first cases of COVID-19 on the same day, Jan. 20, 2020. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the first South Korean case of COVID-19 was detected in a 35-year-old woman who had been living in Wuhan, China:On 20 January 2020, National IHR Focal Point (NFP) for Republic of Korea reported the first case of novel coronavirus in the Republic of Korea. The case is a 35-year-old female, Chinese national, residing in Wuhan, Hubei province in China.That same day, a 35-year-old man who had recently returned to the United States from Wuhan, China, was also diagnosed with the disease. The New England Journal of Medicine reported:On January 20, 2020, the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] confirmed that the patient‚Äôs nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase‚Äìpolymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.The CDC announced that it had confirmed the first U.S. case of COVID-19 in a press release the following day, and a CDC spokesperson told Snopes.com that the patient tested positive for the novel coronavirus on the evening of Jan. 20. The press release came the following morning to give health officials time to notify the patient and discuss the special circumstances of the case.¬†While these countries both detected their first cases of COVID-19 on the same day, they took different approaches to treating the disease and have so far seen vastly different results. At the time of this writing on March 23, 2020, the number of cases in the U.S. had topped 35,000. South Korea had less than 9,000 cases and reported its lowest number of new cases since rates peaked at the end of February.One possible explanation as to why South Korea was relatively successful in combating the disease, while the United States struggled to keep it contained during its initial weeks, may have to do with how each country reacted in the earliest days of the impending pandemic. In brief, South Korea's first action to fight the spread of COVID-19 was to aggressively start testing people for the disease and quarantine those who tested positive. The United States' first actions were aimed at restricting travel from China.¬†A special report from Reuters noted that South Korean health officials gathered in late January 2020 and decided that the need for testing was urgent. South Korea's CDC approved its first diagnostic test the following week, and by the end of February, drive-thru testing facilities that screened thousands of people a day were in operation.¬†The United States took a different approach.¬†When the first patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States in January 2020, President Donald Trump announced a set of travel restrictions on Jan. 31, 2020, that prohibited travelers from arriving from China, the epicenter of the outbreak. The restrictions also required American citizens returning home from China to be screened at airports and monitored for 14 days after their arrival.¬†While the Trump administration did take action to combat the spread of COVID-19 shortly after the first patient was diagnosed in the U.S., the country did not, as South Korea did, immediately ramp up diagnostic testing. According to Reuters, South Korea conducted nearly 300,000 tests within two months of diagnosing their first COVID-19 patient. By contrast, the U.S. only conducted about 60,000 tests in that same time period.Reuters reported (on March 18):South Korea‚Äôs swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the United States. Seven weeks after the train station meeting, the Koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections. New cases are falling off: Ninety-three were reported Wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier.The United States, whose first case was detected the same day as South Korea‚Äôs, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. About 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said Tuesday.	true
6398	President Trump said police and firefighters make too much money in order to justify eliminating some of their tax deductions.	"On 26 December 2017, a story raced across social media with a headline suggesting that United States President Donald Trump had said that firefighters and police officers make too much:Trump: ‚ÄòPolice Officers and Firefighters Make Too Much Money‚Äô‚Ä¶Hits Them with Tax Penalty https://t.co/4e0fNcTPSs‚Äî Joe Alleva (@eaglejpa) December 27, 2017The BlueDotDaily.com¬†article¬†attached to this claim refers to a controversial tax bill¬†passed in late 2017. A number of readers clearly only saw the headline and believed it to reflect a direct quote made by the President. However, the article went on:Trump: Police Officers and Firefighters Make Too Much Money‚Ä¶Hits Them with Tax PenaltyWe all know that the recently passed tax bill is likely the single worst piece of legislation in the history of American politics ... Maybe you aren‚Äôt totally convinced about how bad it is yet. So there‚Äôs this: Under this plan, a wealthy CEO can deduct a private jet, but a police officer cannot deduct his/her uniform.‚ÄúYeah, but they‚Äôre the party of ‚ÄòBlue Lives Matter‚Äô and thanking everyone who ever wore a uniform for anything for their service!‚Äù you might say. And I have some oceanfront property in Idaho to sell you if you believe that.Nowhere in the article is any indication that Trump said or even implied that police, firefighters, or any first responders make too much money. Its actual focus was the taxpayers who used various ""miscellaneous deductions"" when filing their 2015 income tax returns, not whether any party involved said or implied police officers and firefighters were overpaid. (The same provision was addressed in a previous Snopes.com fact check involving misinformation¬†about the effects of the 2017 tax bill.)¬†The Blue Dot Daily article cited a piece from Salon.com to bolster its claim, but that article mentioned law enforcement as only one example out of many:Cops and anyone else who belongs to a union will no longer be allowed to deduct their union dues. People who must bear travel costs without reimbursement from their employers will just have to suck it up starting in January.The new law takes special aim at teachers who seek advanced degrees, which typically qualifies them for more pay. Tuition, books and related costs of getting advanced degrees will not be deductible after the end of this year.Why are Trump and Congressional Republicans dinging first responders, teachers, nurses, traveling salespeople and even those who pay someone to prepare their income tax returns? So the rich can get bigger tax breaks, of course.Tax preparation chain H&R Block's tax information center addressed three changes to itemized deductions introduced by the bill in a 22 December 2017 post, noting that the new act has eliminated or restricted many itemized deductions beginning in 2018 and raised the standard deduction:Itemized deductions have allowed taxpayers, if they qualified, to reduce their taxable income by claiming a variety of deductions. These include mortgage interest, state and local income or sales taxes, property taxes on their homes and cars, charitable contributions, and more. Traditionally, about 30% of taxpayers have itemized deductions (on Schedule A) because their total itemized deductions were more than the standard deduction, based on their filing status....[State and local taxes, or SALT], mortgage interest, and charitable contributions are among the most widely claimed deductions, but the list of deductions that were allowable before 2018 was much more extensive. Gone in 2018 are deductions for unreimbursed employee expenses, tax preparation fees and other miscellaneous deductions. Also gone is the deduction for theft and personal casualty losses, although certain casualty losses in federally declared disaster areas may still be claimed.For taxpayers who used to itemize, it may no longer make sense if the new higher standard deduction exceeds what their itemized deductions would have been.Despite headlines heavily implying that the president had said that police and firefighters in particular are overpaid, itemized deductions for all professions have been eliminated in favor of a higher standard deduction.¬†All professions retain the option to itemize some deductions, but fewer are likely to do so, in part because the increased standard deduction would benefit more affected taxpayers than itemizing."	false
4495	The CDC readjusted the COVID-19 death toll from 60,000 down to 37,000.	"At the beginning of May 2020, widely circulated social media posts asserted that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had substantially revised their figures for the number of deaths in the U.S. caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, from 60,000 down to about 37,000:These posts fed into conspiracy theories holding that the COVID-19 pandemic was not nearly as serious as suggested by the government and the news media, and that the ""true"" mortality figures were being deceptively inflated to achieve some ulterior purpose.However, this claim was not true, and it was the result of comparing two separate data sources that report different measurements.The link included in the above tweet points to the CDC's Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) page, which provides provisional death totals by week and state according to the following criteria:
The provisional data presented on this page include the weekly provisional count of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19, influenza deaths, and deaths involving pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19; (a) by week ending date and (b) by specific jurisdictions.
As of May 1, 2020, that page reported the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. as being 37,308:However, that page also notes that the provisional data it displays are continually revised, may be incomplete, likely will not include more recent deaths, and may differ from other published sources because data currently are lagged by an average of 1‚Äì2 weeks:
The provisional counts for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1‚Äì2 weeks.Provisional death counts may not match counts from other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Our counts often track 1‚Äì2 weeks behind other data for a number of reasons: Death certificates take time to be completed. There are many steps involved in completing and submitting a death certificate. Waiting for test results can create additional delays. States report at different rates. Currently, 63% of all U.S. deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, but there is significant variation among jurisdictions. It takes extra time to code COVID-19 deaths. While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded manually, which takes an average of 7 days. Other reporting systems use different definitions or methods for counting deaths.
That 37,308 was not a drastic downward revision of any previously reported death total.  Rather, it only might have seemed such because it was mistakenly compared to the number of deaths reported on the CDC's COVID-19 Cases in the U.S. page, which as of May 3, 2020, displayed a total of 65,735 deaths:Why such a large discrepancy?  Because as latter page's ""About the Data"" section explains, its data are updated daily based on ""Case notifications received by CDC from U.S. public health jurisdictions and the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)"" and includes ""both confirmed and probable deaths.""  This more up-to-date page will obviously report higher death figures that one whose data lag by 1-2 weeks.  Indeed, two weeks earlier, the ""Cases in the U.S."" page had displayed a total of 35,443 deaths, a number much closer to the 37,308 figure reported by the ""Provisional Death Counts"" with its 1-2 week data lag."	false

5845	Hillary Clinton was killed when she was hit by an out-of-control truck.	"On 1 May 2018, the web site Daily World Update published an article reporting that Hillary Clinton had been accidentally killed when she was hit by an out-of-control truck:
Hillary Clinton was sitting with friends and her daughter, Chelsea, at the Chappaqua Motor Speedway in upstate New York earlier this evening when 11 tons of American steel and irony jumped the rails, injuring thirty-five people and killing Clinton.The machine, the Big Blue Bernie Or Buster, is a modified Jeep CJ-7. The right rear shock, with a diameter of 40 inches and weighing 403 pounds, imploded Clinton‚Äôs head at approximately 14 miles per hour.

4316	A captive panda deliberately faked symptoms of pregnancy in order to obtain special treatment from her keepers.	"People are generally fascinated by examples of other animals engaging in human-like behavior -- all the more so when that behavior involves animals seemingly outsmarting human beings. A case in point is a claim, reflected in the following meme, that a zoo-kept female panda deliberately mimicked the symptoms of pregnancy because she observed that other pregnant pandas in the zoo received special treatment:This claim originated with a 2014 report from the Chinese state-run press agency Xinhua, detailing how a planned live broadcast of the birth of panda cubs at the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Center had been canceled when it was discovered that the expectant mother-to-be was not actually pregnant. A quote from a panda expert cited in the report suggested that some ""clever pandas"" who experienced phantom pregnancies would deliberately continue to exhibit pregnancy symptoms afterwards in order to fool their keepers into providing them with special treatment: 
A celebrated giant panda was removed from a widely-anticipated live birth after it was discovered she was not actually pregnant.The panda Ai Hin, 6, was scheduled to star in the world's first live broadcast of the birth of panda cubs, but the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Center told Xinhua that the panda had a ""phantom pregnancy.""Phantom pregnancy is common among the endangered bears. Non-pregnant pandas can exhibit prenatal behaviors as a result of progestational hormone changes. But experts said sometimes the pandas, noticing the difference in treatment after exhibiting initial signs of pregnancy, may carry on with the pregnant behavior.""After showing prenatal signs, the 'mothers-to-be' are moved into single rooms with air conditioning and around-the-clock care. They also receive more buns, fruits and bamboo, so some clever pandas have used this to their advantage to improve their quality of life,"" said Wu Kongju, an expert at the Chengdu Base.
But another panda expert quickly walked that claim back, asserting that the behavior was due to hormonal changes rather than purposeful trickery and had been observed in both captive and wild pandas:
Claims that a six-year-old panda faked signs of pregnancy to receive better treatment from her conservation centre carers have been debunked by one of China's leading panda experts.State newswire Xinhua reported that Ai Hin may have deliberately demonstrated signs of pregnancy, including ""reduced appetite, less mobility and a surge in progestational hormone"".Pandas that staff believe to be expecting are given a single, air-conditioned room, as well as more buns, fruit and bamboo than non-pregnant pandas. ""So some clever pandas have used this to their advantage to improve their quality of life,"" Wu Kongju, an expert at the Chengdu research base of giant panda breeding, told Xinhua.But Zhang Heming, director of the China research and conservation centre for the giant panda told the Guardian that Ai Hin's behaviour was probably more of a hormonal issue than a deliberate ruse. ""This phenomenon occurs in 10 to 20% of pandas,"" he said. ""After the mother panda is inseminated, if her health isn't so good, the pregnancy will terminate, but she'll still behave as if she's pregnant.""He continued: ""This phenomenon also happens to wild pandas, if they don't have enough bamboo to eat.""
The meme displayed above erroneously attributed this claim to a panda kept at the Smithsonian‚Äôs National Zoo rather than at a facility in China. However, the former did report a case of panda pseudopregnancy in 2019:
Reproductive scientists, veterinarians and animal keepers at the Smithsonian‚Äôs National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute have determined that giant panda Mei Xiang will not give birth this year. She has been experiencing a pseudopregnancy over the past several months.Giant pandas‚Äô behavior and hormones mimic a pregnancy even if they are experiencing a pseudopregnancy. Reproductive scientists had been tracking Mei Xiang‚Äôs hormones since she was artificially inseminated March 28. Her levels of urinary progesterone began to rise in July indicating that she would give birth to a cub or experience the final stages of a pregnancy within 6 to 8 weeks. Her hormone levels are at baseline levels and her behavior is slowly returning to normal. Veterinarians have also not detected a developing fetus on any ultrasounds.The panda team has tracked Mei Xiang‚Äôs behavior closely during the past several weeks. Specially-trained volunteers with Friends of the National Zoo started monitoring her from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. via the panda cams in late August, watching for specific behaviors associated with pregnancy and pseudopregnancy. She started showing behavioral changes Aug. 7, including sensitivity to noise, which prompted the panda team to close the panda house. Veterinarians conducted ultrasounds twice each week to track changes in Mei Xiang‚Äôs uterus and to try to detect a developing fetus. "	false
3292	"During an interview broadcast on March 16, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden said ""don't come"" to migrants considering trips to the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum in America."	"Biden's comments in spring 2021 implied that he would take a different stance when his administration completed its rollout of proposed changes to the country's asylum-seeking process.
In spring 2021, leaders of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration scrambled for solutions to an increase of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.¬†Meanwhile, rumors circulated about the new president's message to those people.Specifically, social media posts, like the one displayed below, claimed Biden urged migrants to avoid making the trip to southern border crossings altogether.The claim was true at face value, though it lacked necessary context to fully comprehend why Biden made the statement.During an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that broadcast on March 16, the president indeed said ""don't come"" to migrants considering the trip due to the bottleneck of people currently waiting at border patrol facilities (in part because the COVID-19 pandemic) and the new administration's proposed plans to reform the asylum-seeking process.Before we analyze that media appearance, let this be clear: The numbers of both unaccompanied children and families seeking asylum and waiting for court hearings at the southern border in spring 2021, under Biden, were lower than they were at various points during the Trump administration, according to The Associated Press. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, compiled by The Washington Post, found an annual seasonal bump of migrants at the border during cooler months.Now, let's focus on Biden's comments during the ABC interview.According to a transcript and video recording of the media appearance, the latter of which we obtained via ABC's website, the president said border officials were indeed instructed to send adult migrants back to their home countries -- denying them access to the U.S. -- and attempting to connect unaccompanied children with social services.Simultaneously, he said his administration was trying to establish a new system for people to register for asylum, though he did not provide specifics or an exact timeline for when those changes would take effect. (Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas elaborated on the efforts in an interview with NPR about one month earlier, saying nongovernmental organizations were preparing to identify applicants for asylum based on the severity of their situations and then allow them to register for the status via ""electronic portals."")Then, Stephanopoulos and Biden had the following exchange:Stephanopoulos: It‚Äôs going to take some time though to get those policies in place again. Do you have to say quite clearly, 'Don‚Äôt come'?Biden: Yes. I can say quite clearly, ""Don‚Äôt come."" What we‚Äôre in the process of getting set up, and it‚Äôs not going to take a whole long time, is to be able to apply for asylum in place. So don‚Äôt leave your town or city or community. We‚Äôre going to make sure we have facilities in those cities and towns run by [Department of Homeland Security] and also access with HHS, the Health and Human Services, to say you can apply for asylum from where you are right now. Make your case. We‚Äôll have people there to determine whether or not you are able to meet the requirement you qualify for asylum. That‚Äôs the best way to do this.In other words, while Biden indeed cautioned people against making the trip to border crossings in March 2021, his comments implied that he would take a different stance in the future when his administration completed its rollout of changes to the country's asylum-seeking process.Days after that interview, the U.S. Embassy to Haiti used its official Twitter account to highlight several of Biden's quotes during the ABC interview -- such as, ""I can say quite clearly, don't come over"" -- in both English and Haitian Creole.Considering that evidence, specifically the video interview of Biden with Stephanopoulos, we rate this claim ""True.""It was not the first -- nor the last -- instance of a member of the Biden administration or the president himself cautioning migrants against making the trip to U.S.-Mexico border crossings."	true

979	The World Health Organization is holding a secret meeting that will greatly expand its legal authority.	"In mid-January 2023, conspiracy theorists ran with a baffling suggestion: A publicly scheduled meeting of a World Health Organization (WHO) committee ‚Äî the terms of which had already been agreed upon in an earlier and equally public meeting ‚Äî represented a covert power grab by the organization.¬†The meeting in question, which took place between Jan. 9 and 13, 2023, concerned amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) ‚Äî¬† a set of already legally binding international laws governing how states respond to public health emergencies. The IHR has been revised and amended several times in the past, most recently in January 2016.¬†The January 2023 meeting was of the International Health Regulations Review Committee (IHRRC). The IHR, according to WHO, provides ""an overarching legal framework that defines countries' rights and obligations in handling public health events and emergencies that have the potential to cross borders"":¬†The IHR are an instrument of international law that is legally-binding on 196 countries, including the 194 WHO Member States. The IHR grew out of the response to deadly epidemics that once overran Europe. They create rights and obligations for countries, including the requirement to report public health events. The Regulations also outline the criteria to determine whether or not a particular event constitutes a ""public health emergency of international concern.""As this meeting was underway, conspiracy-theory oriented media outlets and social media personalities began casting the affair as a secret meeting that ‚Äî among other nefarious intentions ‚Äî allowed WHO to expand its authority with limited oversight through amendments to the IHR. Discussion of this meeting, which is sometimes accompanied by the hashtag #stoptheamendments, often contains the same copypasta text alleging the meeting is a secret:The International Health Regulations Review Committee (IHRRC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) is planning to meet in secret from Monday, January 9, 2023 to Friday January 13, 2023. The IHRRC will be working to finalize what is now a 46 page document that includes proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR).In addition to that statement, that copypasta text also included a list of 10 proposed amendments described in a way that is ‚Äî to put it mildly ‚Äî aggressively misleading. Among these claims were:¬†Secret Negotiations for the Amendments to the International Health Regulations change the overall nature of the World Health Organization from an advisory organization that merely makes recommendations to a governing body whose proclamations would be legally-binding. (Article 1)Greatly expand the scope of the International Health Regulations to include scenarios that merely have a ""potential to impact public health.""Seek to remove ""respect for dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of people."" (Article 3)¬†Here, Snopes demonstrates that this meeting was not secret, and that conspiratorial discussion of these amendments represented, at best, a superficial reading of the proposals designed to instill fear.The IHRRC meeting in January 2023 had never been secret. It followed, among other events, a May 2022 meeting of all WHO member states that, through compromise, set out a framework and timeline for amending the IHR in light of the most recent pandemic. This meeting and the proposed followup meeting were publicly reported on at the time. As Politico wrote in May 2022:Under the compromise, officially agreed on by countries on Friday evening, countries will have 10 months to reject an amendment to the health regulations instead of nine months, as appeared in an earlier draft text. What has remained in the text is that any amendment to the regulations will come into effect in 12 months. That shaves a year off the current timeline. ¬†A new paragraph added to the text refers to another decision taken at the assembly that will see a working group discuss future IHR amendments. The new text also states that this group will look at amendments to ""address specific and clearly identified issues, challenges, including equity, technological or other developments, or gaps that could not effectively be addressed otherwise.The IHRRC meeting represented the final meeting of that working group. As the WHO issued news releases about this meeting at its launch, it was never secret. WHO General Secretary Tedros Ghebreyesus issued this public statement at the start of the meeting:¬†This is the 6th and final meeting of the Review Committee on amendments to the IHR, which I convened last October at the request of Member States. ‚Ä¶In total, more than 300 amendments were proposed by Member States, for 33 of the IHR's 66 articles and for five of its nine annexes; in addition, six new articles and one new annex were proposed.¬†The proposed amendments reflect the critical need to strengthen the IHR to improve prevention, preparedness, and response to public health events that carry a risk of international spread.¬† The Committee has identified several cross-cutting themes, including equity, transparency, trust, sovereignty, collaboration, and assistance, with the overarching goal of protecting public health.¬†These aforementioned amendments were also not secret. Conspiracy theorists have built their entire case about these proposed amendments by looking at a document that literally lays out ‚Äî line by line ‚Äî each of the proposed changes being discussed.¬†The IHR was¬†already legally binding. The totality of the argument that the amendments ""change the overall nature of the World Health Organization from an advisory organization that merely makes recommendations to a governing body whose proclamations would be legally-binding"" rests on the observation that the word ""non-binding"" was removed from two definitions in the proposed amendments:Regardless of the removal of the word non-binding, the WHO was still offering ""advice"" here. Further, this change does not represent a legal shift in WHO power or authority, as the IHR as a whole has always been legally binding.¬†The discussion of the rest of the amendments shared in the copypasta text was similarly superficial, recasting linguistic choices as an attempt to increase legal authority. For example, people sowing fear about the amendments meeting frequently referenced the fact that the amendments removed the words ""respect for dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of people."" While this is true, such discussion omits the words this clause was replaced with:¬†This was not a rejection of human rights, as conspiracy theorists suggested, but a restatement of human rights ‚Äî as WHO secretary general indicated ‚Äî based on ""cross-cutting themes, including equity, transparency, trust, sovereignty, collaboration, and assistance, with the overarching goal of protecting public health.""More broadly, these amendments did not change the nature of WHO or provide it with enhanced legal authority, as the IHR rules have always been legally binding. As proposed, they do potentially enhance the ability of member states to produce and stockpile vaccine ingredients and authorize ‚Äî with deference to local laws ‚Äî entry requirements based on things like a negative COVID-19 test.¬†Changes like these are frequently made to the IHR, and their occurrence is far from secret. Every step of this process has been public, reported on, and documented.¬†Because the meeting was not secret and because it did not change the legally binding nature of the IHR, claims that a secret meeting was held by the IHRRC to usurp power for the WHO should be rated ""False.""¬†"	false
3671	"U.S. President Donald Trump is going to ""tactically"" implement voter interference sanctions from a 2018 executive order."	"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In mid-December 2020, a copy-pasted (""copypasta"") meme spread on social media platforms warning ""patriots"" that U.S. President Donald Trump was about to ""tactically"" implement elements of an executive order on election security signed in 2018, telling them to have weapons ""at the ready"":The incendiary meme appears to reference an executive order signed by Trump on Sept. 12, 2018, ahead of the midterm elections. The meme claimed that Trump was to implement parts of the order at some point between Dec. 18 and Dec. 24, 2020.Here is a portion of the text:This will freeze the money and assets of people and entities to include Facebook, Twitter, the Fake News Corp, AND Chinese U.S. financial accounts. Be prepared to assist the National Guard and the military commands in defense of Our nation. Make sure that you have your weapons at the ready. But DO NOT interfere with the operations of the military. During this time, local law enforcement will have no authority. So, assemble small Patriot teams to patrol and secure your own and surrounding neighborsTrump's 2018 executive order has nothing to do with military or National Guard deployment domestically, nor does it mention the broad suspension of financial assets of social media platforms and ""Chinese U.S. financial accounts."" The meme appears to actually be referencing extreme calls by some of Trump's supporters, echoing his false claims that the November 2020 election was beset by mass-scale fraud and advocating that Trump impose martial law in response.The 2018 executive order ‚Äî signed less than a month before the 2018 midterm elections ‚Äî was meant as a deterrent against foreign election interference. The order stated that the Trump administration was ready to implement sanctions against any foreign entity that interfered in the election process.It's noteworthy that the order was signed ahead of the first national election since 2016, during which the Russian government interfered in an effort to sow chaos in the U.S. and help Trump's electoral efforts. Trump was under political pressure at that time to stem similar interference in 2018.Notably, Facebook and Twitter are American companies, not foreign entities. It's unclear to us what exactly ""Fake News Corp"" refers to, but unsurprisingly, no such company exists. Sanctions can't be imposed on a fictional entity.The 2018 executive order relies on various department heads to make determinations about foreign election interference and potential sanctions ‚Äî in other words, it doesn't give Trump unilateral authority to take action.For example, it gives the director of national intelligence 45 days to determine whether foreign interference in an election had occurred, at which point the assessment must be delivered to ""the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security.""After further consultation between these department heads, the executive order then leaves the secretary of treasury, who is currently Steve Mnuchin, to lead in the implementation of economic sanctions. The departments of Treasury and State would then assess whether additional sanctions were necessary and present their findings to the White House."	false
5602	The Hyatt hotel chain stated they will no longer host conservative guests or gatherings.	"A decision by Hyatt Hotels Corp. in September 2018 to ban hate groups from their properties led to an unfounded accusation that the chain was turning its back on all political conservatives.ACT for America (AForA) blamed a ""Soros-funded smear campaign"" -- invoking a popular conservative conspiracy -- for the hotel chain's decision in a statement posted online on 4 October 2018.""Their decisions to ban 'hate groups' is in reality a decision to ban all freedom loving, flag waving, conservative Americans from their hotel chains,"" the statement read. ""While we have come to expect this from left-wing radicals, we certainly did not expect a prominent American hotel chain to weaponize their brand and influence against the conservative voice"":ACT for America's statement was released in response to Hyatt's announcement on 28 September 2018 that they would no longer allow groups ""who primarily seek to disparage or demean a specific group of people, to host meetings or events at our hotels.""AForA has claimed that they are not an anti-Muslim organization and should not be excluded by Hyatt's hate groups policy. But AForA's leader, Brigitte Gabriel, has argued that the Arab world is beset by ""barbarism"" and that people in those countries ""are dead-set on killing and destruction."" The group also organized ""March Against Sharia"" events in 2017, seizing on the conservative claim that ""Sharia Law"" is growing in the U.S.The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has designated AForA as a hate group, arguing that ""it pushes wild anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, denigrates American Muslims and deliberately conflates mainstream and radical Islam.""Hyatt's policy announcement came shortly after one of their hotels in Crystal City, Virginia, hosted AForA's annual conference, during which Gabriel bragged that she had a ""standing meeting once a week"" with President Donald Trump. AForA's choice of conference site was first reported in February 2018, and it prompted a campaign by activist groups such as MoveOn and Muslim Advocates urging Hyatt to turn Gabriel's group away.On 30 August 2018, the activist groups delivered what they said were 100,000 signatures on a petition calling for Hyatt not to host AForA's conference, but the event was held as scheduled nonetheless. Scott Simpson, public advocacy director for Muslim Advocates, called Hyatt's decision ""a breath of fresh air"" and rejected AForA's claims about a blanket ban on conservatives.""I certainly don't want conservatives banned from places,"" Simpson said. ""I don't stand for that, and I know Muslim Advocates don't stand for that."""	false
3805	Reindeer are the only mammals capable of seeing ultraviolet light.	"As Christmas nears, so too do fun memes with purported wintery arctic facts. One popular addition to this genre is the claim that reindeer are the only mammals capable of seeing ultraviolet (UV) light:While scientific evidence suggests that reindeer sense and react to UV light, they are not the only mammal capable of such a feat.To orient ourselves, recall that the visible light spectrum for humans spans from the color red (which has the largest wavelengths ‚Äî around 700 nanometers) to violet (which has the shortest wavelengths ‚Äî around 380 nm). Ultraviolet light has even shorter wavelengths than the color violet and is visually imperceptible to humans and most other mammals.There are, of course, some exceptions to this rule, and reindeer are indeed one of those exceptions.In 2011, a team of researchers found that ""Arctic reindeer extend their visual range into the ultraviolet"" during the extended sunless winters characteristic of high latitudes. High latitudes, as well, have relatively more UV light due to atmospheric scattering. The authors surmised two things: that being able to see UV light provides a significant visual advantage in the arctic winter and that reindeer must have evolved some protection against UV light, which typically damages mammalian eyes:A specific advantage of this short-wavelength vision is the use of potential information caused by differential UV reflections known to occur in both Arctic vegetation and different types of snow. UV is normally highly damaging to the retina, resulting in photoreceptor degeneration. Because such damage appears not to occur in these animals, they may have evolved retinal mechanisms protecting against extreme UV exposure present in the daylight found in the snow-covered late winter environment.Reindeer, however, were not the first mammals discovered with the ability to see into the UV range of light. Rodents, notably, are capable of this as well. In 1991, researchers discovered that this group of organisms is capable of seeing into the UV spectrum ‚Äî the first time scientists had made such a discovery in mammals."	false
1853	California's governor is allowing people who are HIV-positive donate blood	"On 13 September 2017, YourNewsWire.com posted a story regarding a state legislative bill in California that contradicted itself within the first two paragraphs:California Governor Jerry Brown is expected to give a green light to a bill allowing HIV positive people to knowingly expose their blood to others.The bill, SB 239, will reduce the penalties for knowingly exposing someone to HIV without telling them, allowing HIV positive people to donate their blood to others. Lawmakers claim the current felony charge for the crime is 'discriminatory.'The measure, which was approved by the state Senate on 11 September 2017, does indeed reduce the penalties for HIV-positive people who knowingly expose others to the virus or donate blood. But as the state legislature's website stated, doing so is still illegal:The bill would instead make the intentional transmission of an infectious or communicable disease, as defined, a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 6 months if certain circumstances apply, including that the defendant knows he or she or a 3rd party is afflicted with the disease, that the defendant acts with the specific intent to transmit or cause an afflicted 3rd party to transmit the disease to another person, that the defendant or the afflicted 3rd party engages in conduct that poses a substantial risk of transmission, as defined, that the defendant or the afflicted 3rd party transmits the disease to the other person, and if the exposure occurs through interaction with the defendant and not a 3rd party, that the person exposed to the disease during voluntary interaction with the defendant did not know that the defendant was afflicted with the disease.The bill would also make it a misdemeanor to attempt to intentionally transmit an infectious and communicable disease, as specified, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 90 days. This bill would make willful exposure to an infectious or communicable disease, as defined, a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 6 months, and would prohibit a health officer, or a health officer‚Äôs designee, from issuing a maximum of 2 instructions to a defendant that would result in a violation of this provision. The bill would impose various requirements upon the court in order to prevent the public disclosure of the identifying characteristics, as defined, of the complaining witness and the defendant. By creating new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.Brown signed the bill into law on 6 October 2017. Before then, knowingly exposing a person to the virus via sexual contact was a felony punishable by either three, five, or eight years in prison. It was also a felony for an HIV-positive person to knowingly ""donate blood, tissue, or, under specified circumstances, semen or breast milk.""Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, who introduced the bill, told us in an e-mail on 18 September 2017:Sexual assault will remain a felony, regardless of HIV status. So if someone with HIV sexually assaults someone, that will be continue to be a felony. In addition, SB 239 does not repeal the HIV-related sentencing enhancement for sexual assaults.The goal of the bill, Wiener said, was to end HIV infections:SB 239 will make it more likely that people will get tested for HIV and seek treatment, by removing stigma. Criminalizing health conditions harms public health. Criminalizing HIV makes it less likely people will get tested. If an HIV infection occurs, we need to make sure that people have access to healthcare.The bill passed in the state Senate by a margin of 24-12 (with four lawmakers abstaining) four days after the state assembly approved it in a 52-19 vote (with eight members abstaining). One of the bill's critics, Republican Sen. Joel Anderson said:I'm of the mind that if you purposefully inflict another with a disease that alters their lifestyle the rest of their life, puts them on a regiment of medications to maintain any kind of normalcy, it should be a felony. It's absolutely crazy to me that we should go light on this.However, a 28 June 2017 editorial by two Alameda County Public Health Department officials argued that intentional exposure to the virus is rare. J. Phoenix Smith (interim head of the department's HIV care unit) and Nicholas J. Moss (director of its HIV STD Section)¬†wrote:Of note, a careful examination of hundreds cases revealed only two cases of actual intentional HIV transmission ‚Äî nationwide, over more than 30 years.Wiener and the bill's sponsor in the Assembly, Democratic lawmaker Todd Gloria, said in a statement that the bill is supported by several LGBTQ and HIV-related advocacy groups, including the Center for HIV Law & Policy, the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, and the San Francisco AIDS Foundation among others.But another HIV activist, Deondre B. Moore, said in a March 2017 post for the group HIV Equal that the bill should be revised. In his piece, Moore reveals that a partner infected him with the virus after lying to him about testing negative. While he does not feel having HIV is a ""death sentence,"" he said, his peace of mind was stolen by his former partner's behavior:No one deserves a pass. It‚Äôs one thing to be positive and be in control of your health by engaging in care and maintaining an undetectable viral load. It‚Äôs another thing to just not care and intentionally aim to infect others with HIV. Something should be done and justice should always be served. I believe that SB 239 should be revised to note that, a person with a proven undetectable viral load should not be penalized or have to face consequences for having unprotected sex and not disclosing their status. However, a person who is positive and is proven to be intentionally infecting or aiming to infect others should face felony charges and brought to justice.When asked for a response to Moore's remarks, Wiener told us:"	false
488	Handling an egg or a baby bird will cause its mother to reject it.	Children are routinely cautioned that they must not touch baby birds found in the wild nor lay so much as a finger on eggs discovered in nests, lest such actions cause a mother bird to reject her young or abandon her nest. This bit of lore confidently asserts that wild birds are so sensitive to the dangers posed by humans that they will fly off, never to return, if they catch even a faint whiff of human scent around the nest or on their young.However, Mother birds will not reject their babies because they smell human scent on them, nor will they refuse to set on eggs that have been handled by a person. Many birds have a limited sense of smell and cannot detect human scent, or if they can detect it, do not react to it. (If you handle bird eggs while the mother is away from the nest, mama bird may notice upon her return that the eggs were disturbed during her absence, and some species of bird will take this as an indication that a dangerous intruder has been present and may temporarily or even permanently abandon their nests as a result. Such behavior is relatively rare, however, and in these situations the mother birds are reacting to visual warnings, not olfactory ones.)Possibly this widespread caution against handling young birds springs from a desire to protect them from the many well-intentioned souls who, upon discovering fledglings on the ground, immediately think to cart them away to be cared for. Rather than attempting to impress upon these folks the real reason for leaving well enough alone (that a normal part of most fledglings' lives is a few days on the ground before they fully master their flying skills), a bit of lore such as this one works to keep many people away from young birds by instilling in them a fear that their actions will doom the little ones to slow starvation. Lore is thus called into service to prevent a harmful act that a rational explanation would be much less effective in stopping.Why should you not immediately bear young birds away to a safer place? Primarily because the last thing you want to do is separate baby birds from their parents. Don't consider picking up such finds and bringing them into your home to be cared for, because their parents will do a much better job than you ever could. Chances are very good that mom and dad are close at hand, even if you don't see them.The first step in aiding young birds is determining whether the little ones are nestlings or fledglings. Nestlings are featherless or fuzzy and belong in a nest. Fledglings have feathers and are old enough to leave the nest and be on the ground or in a shrub. Replace nestlings into the nest they have fallen from, but leave fledglings where you find them.If the nestlings' nest has been destroyed (a high wind, perhaps), create a new one from a berry basket or margarine tub that has had holes poked into the bottom of it for drainage. Line the improvised nest with pine needles or paper towels and tack it up in a tree or shrub as close to the original nest as possible. Place the nestlings in their new home and leave. The parents will usually return and take up feeding the babies as if they were still in the original nest.Fledglings usually spend several days on the ground or on tree limbs after leaving the nest but before their flight skills have developed well enough for them to no longer need the care of their parents. During this time, the parents bring food to these little ones and teach them various survival skills. If you've fledglings in your backyard and are worried that the family cat might take them, keep the cat in for a few days. Likewise, keep the children (and over-enthusiastic adults) away from that area for as long as the young birds are earthbound.	false
2967	A video filmed in Western Australia shows an octopus lunging at a human.	"On March 18, 2021, author Lance Karlson posted a video to Instagram of an octopus in shallow water lunging toward him in an aggressive manner. ""Oh. Golly,"" he responded in what would become the latest viral cephalopod video:There is no reason to think the video is anything but legitimate. The video was filmed in Dunsborough, Western Australia. This region is home to the Western Australian common octopus ‚Äî closely related to the common Sydney octopus but recently determined to be its own species. This species, as seen in the video, is ""commonly found in and around inshore reef systems and sandy benthos"" and it ""completes its life cycle in nearshore and continental shelf waters.""Speaking to The New York Times, Peter Ulric Tse, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at Dartmouth College who studies octopus cognition, said that octopuses, in general, ""can express what we would call aggression when they feel threatened or when they feel their territory is under threat.‚Äù Tse said that the behavior captured in Karlson's video is likely a warning not an attempted attack.My guess is that the octopus here is sending a warning meaning 'back off' ‚Ä¶ Octopuses will lunge or shoot an arm out when they feel a fish, another octopus or a human is in their space. I think this is often pre-emptive aggression, meant to signal ‚Äòdon‚Äôt mess with me,‚Äô rather than aggression seriously meant to harm the 'invader.'Sadly, this cephalopod's potential warning shot was not heeded. ""Amused by the interaction but ultimately unfazed, [Karlson] returned ... to the water about 20 minutes later,"" the Times reported.¬† ""About 30 meters out, he noticed a pile of crab shells piled neatly together. He dove underwater to take a look, and he remembered a documentary that he had watched in which he learned octopuses tended to pile up crab shells."" At this juncture, Karlson was whipped on his arm and on his back by an octopus, causing modest amounts of pain.The Western Australia common octopus is indeed a fan of crabs. In fact, the lunging behavior seen in the video resembles the tactics employed by another Western Australia octopus that went viral for successfully capturing a crab ‚Äî¬† on land ‚Äî¬† in 2015:That video was filmed in Yallingup, Western Australia, which is right next to Dunsborough, where Karlson filmed his interaction with the defensive octopus."	true
561	The term '420' entered drug parlance as a term signifying the time to light up a joint.	"Odd terms sneak into our language every now and then, and this is one of the oddest. Everyone who considers himself in the know about the drug subculture has heard that '420' has something to do with illegal drug use, but when you press them, they never seem to know why, or even what the term supposedly signifies.It's both more and less than people make it out to be. The term '420' began its sub-rosa linguistic career in 1971 as a bit of slang casually used by a group of high school kids (known as ""Waldos"") at San Rafael High School in California. The term '420' (always pronounced ""four-twenty,"" never ""four hundred and twenty"") came to be an accepted part of the argot within that group of about a dozen pot smokers, beginning as a reminder of the time they planned to meet to light up, 4:20 p.m.:[The 420] origins appear to lie in the escapades of a group of friends from San Rafael high school, northern California, in 1971. That autumn, the five teenagers came into possession of a hand-drawn map supposedly locating a marijuana crop at Point Reyes, north-west of San Francisco.The friends ‚Äî who called themselves the Waldos because they used to hang out by a wall ‚Äî met after school, at 4:20 pm, and drove off on their treasure hunt. They never found the plot. ""We were smoking a lot of weed at the time,"" says Dave Reddix or Waldo Dave, now a filmmaker. ""Half the fun was just going looking for it."" The group began using the term 420. So did friends and acquaintances, who included ‚Äî at a couple of steps removed ‚Äî members of the Grateful Dead rock band. The term spread among the band's fans, known as Deadheads.Then in 1990 Steve Bloom, an editor at High Times, saw 420 explained on a Grateful Dead concert flyer. Staff on the magazine, long the leading publication on marijuana, started using it.Keep in mind this wasn't a general call to all dope smokers everywhere to toke up at twenty past four every day; it was twelve kids who'd made a date to meet after school near a certain statue. It's thus incorrect to deem that '420' originated as the designation of a national or international dope-smoking time, even though the term began as a reference to a particular time of day, as the originators of that term explained:The Waldos met at 4:20 for exactly all of the reasons we have discussed in the past:The time we got out of school was approximately 3 p.m., but some of us had after school sports activities that lasted until after 4 p.m.There was just enough time to get back to the statue of Louis Pasteur to smoke and look for the pot fields drawn in a treasure map.These days '420' is used as a generic way of declaring one likes to use marijuana or just as a term for the substance itself. Its earliest connotation of having to do with the time a certain group of students congregated to smoke wacky tobaccy is unknown to many of those who now employ the term. Indeed, most instead believe one or more of the many spurious explanations that have since grown up about this much abused short form:However, on 1 January 2004 the Governor of California signed that state's Senate Bill 420, which regulates marijuana used for medical purposes. This bill comes years after the term '420' was associated with marijuana and indeed its number likely was chosen because of the existing pop culture connection. This is the tail wagging the dog, not the other way around.Spurious etymologies and uncertain definition aside, '420' has slipped into a position of semi-respectability within the English lexicon. Various free-wheeling cities annually celebrate ""hemp fests"" on April 20. There's a 4:20 record label in California, and a band called 4:20. Atlanta's Sweetwater Brewing Co. sells its 420 Pale Ale in supermarkets and opens its doors to the public at 4:20 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays. New York's 420 Tours sells low-cost travel packages to the Netherlands and Jamaica. Highway 420 Radio broadcasts ""music for the chemically enhanced."" And in 2001, the forReal.org web site of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance Abuse Prevention put out a public service document titled, ""It's 4:20 ‚Äî Do You Know Where Your Teen Is?""420s are routinely slipped into popular movies and television shows. In Fast Times at Ridgemont High the score of the football game was 42-0. Most of the clocks in Pulp Fiction are set to 4:20 (but not all: when the kid receives the watch it's set at 9:00). And there are many other instances, so keep your eyes peeled."	true
1263	A photograph shows Albert Einstein playing an electric guitar.	"For years, a photo supposedly showing Albert Einstein playing an electric guitar has circulated online.We tend to think of Einstein purely as a man of science, the towering genius of the 20th century who spent most of his life steeped in mathematics and physics while he probed the mysteries of the universe. But a less well-known facet of Einstein‚Äôs life is that he was also a gifted and enthusiastic violinist and pianist who often sought solace in music, both as a performer and a listener. Indeed, he once asserted that had he not been a scientist, he would have been a musician:‚ÄúLife without playing music is inconceivable for me,‚Äù he declared. ‚ÄúI live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music. I get most joy in life out of music.‚ÄùEinstein‚Äôs mother, Pauline, was a talented pianist who brought music to life in the family home. Albert began to learn the violin at the age of six, while his family was still living in Munich. However, he toiled under unimaginative tuition until discovering the joys of Mozart‚Äôs sonatas at the age of 13. From that point on, although he had no further lessons, his violin remained his constant companion.When Einstein moved to Aarau in Switzerland in 1895 to complete his schooling, he seemed to have devoted a good deal of his time to music. It is recorded that he worked hard on the Brahms G-major violin sonata in order to get the full benefit from a visit to Aarau of the great violinist Joseph Joachim, on whose program it appeared. Just before his 17th birthday, Einstein played at a music examination in the cantonal school. The inspector reported that ‚Äúa student called Einstein shone in a deeply feltperformance of an adagio from one of the Beethoven sonatas."" In addition to his prowess on the violin, he also played the piano and, in particular, loved to improvise.So although it‚Äôs not inconceivable that Einstein might have been photographed noodling around on a musical instrument, it is extremely unlikely that that instrument would have been an electric guitar. Einstein was a violinist and sometime pianist; there is no record of his ever giving the guitar a try. Moreover, Einstein‚Äôs musical tastes were decidedly conservative, favoring Bach and Mozart while eschewing contemporary composers such as Wagner, so he almost certainly would not have favored any form of music that one would be likely to play on the type of instrument he‚Äôs pictured holding here."	false

"While several people truly clung to the outside of a plane in an attempt to flee the Taliban in August 2021, one viral video purporting to document the incident is a digital creation. On August 16, 2021, as Taliban forces took over the presidential palace in Kabul in the wake of the exit of U.S. forces, Afghan citizens attempted to flee the area by boarding a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III.

Readers will also get a glimpse at videos and still photographs of O'Keefe's performance.On Feb. 8, the tidbit about O'Keefe's role in ""Oklahoma!"" was tweeted about by The Daily Beast's Justin Baragona and reported on by Will Sommer.The reason why users were talking about O'Keefe's performance was because his name was in the news on the same day for another reason.According to NYMag.com, O'Keefe was on paid leave after some of the company's employees signed a letter with concerns about his conduct in the workplace. Project Veritas issued a response¬†on Twitter, but did not mention O'Keefe by name.""There are 65+ employees at Project Veritas dedicated to continuing the mission to expose corruption, dishonesty, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions,"" the statement read, in part.At the time we published this fact check, the story about O'Keefe's employment was still developing. The Daily Beast and NYMag.com reported that they were unable to receive comment from O'Keefe on the matter.On Dec. 12, 2022, The New York Times published that Project Veritas had reported in a filing to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that ""it provided a prohibited 'excess benefit'"" to O'Keefe.The ""excess benefit"" amount was reported as being $20,512.A spokesperson for the company acknowledged the amount and told The New York Times that the spending was ""related to Project Veritas staff who accompanied Mr. O'Keefe when he starred in an outdoor production of 'Oklahoma!'.""The story from the Times has more on the subject, and added, ""Project Veritas also has an ongoing¬†defamation suit¬†against The New York Times.""As for O'Keefe's acting role, it's true that he once starred in a stage production of ""Oklahoma!."" The performance was an offering from the company Brian Clowdus Experiences. It played in an outdoor farm setting in Roseland, Virginia, between Aug. 19 and Sept. 5, 2021.Brian Clowdus, the CEO of the production company, responded to the recent reporting from NYMag.com and The Daily Beast to show support for O'Keefe while he was reportedly on leave.According to an announcement from Project Veritas, the production's cast was at least partially made up of people who had been¬†""blacklisted through cancel culture for simply standing up for their personal beliefs.""We found videos that showed O'Keefe performing in the role of Curly McLain, who sings the ""Oklahoma!"" tune, ""Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'."" He can be seen on a horse at the beginning of the clip:Another video was posted to Twitter by conservative influencer Jack Posobiec that also showed O'Keefe and other cast members singing:Several Facebook posts from Brian Clowdus Experiences also showed photographs of O'Keefe rehearsing and performing:More information about the production can be found on the same Facebook page."	true
2012	On May 2, 1845, 79 people died after the Yarmouth suspension bridge collapsed in Great Yarmouth, England, as they watched a circus stunt involving a clown in a bathtub being pulled by four geese.	"On Sept. 23, 2022, a curious Reddit post on the r/todayilearned (TIL) subreddit took off like a rocket and quickly made its way to the website's front page. Its title read, ""TIL that in 1845, 79 people died in a bridge collapse that happened because a large crowd had gathered to watch a clown in a bathtub be pulled up a river by four geese."" According to historical records, all of this was true.The Liverpool Echo recounted the old story in 1959. The newspaper headline read, ""The Goose Ride to Tragedy,"" and called the incident ""the maddest publicity stunt of 1845."" We also looked to original reporting from Jackson's Oxford Journal, which was published within days of the tragedy.The setting for this story was on the River Bure in Great Yarmouth. The seaside town is on the east coast of England, about a three-hour drive from London.It all happened on a Friday night. On the evening of May 2, 1845, a crowd gathered to see an act known as ""Mr. Nelson,"" who was a clown with William Cooke's circus. The stunt, which was promoted on a large flyer, consisted of the clown sitting in a bathtub in the river and being pulled by four geese. One flyer appeared to indicate that Cooke would portray the role of the clown. The idea sounded innocent enough.Unfortunately, as the clown performed the act with the geese, the Yarmouth suspension bridge collapsed under the immense weight of hundreds of people. Some 400 spectators were reported to have fallen into the water. Just as the Reddit post said, 79 people died, with 51 of them being children under the age of 14.We transcribed some of the original reporting from Jackson's Oxford Journal, which was published eight days after the incident on May 10:Awful Calamity at Yarmouth, NorfolkIn the afternoon of Friday, Nelson, the clown at Cooke's Circus, proceeded to perform a feat which has excited some attention, both in London and the provinces, since it was first introduced by the late Mr. Usher, swimming in a washingtub drawn by four geese. He was to start from the drawbridge on the quay, and go to the suspension bridge, which was erected on the site of an ancient ferry, near the Bure, and opened on April 23, 1829.Thousands of spectators were collected to witness this spectacle; and the bridge, which has recently been widened four feet beyond the chains, for the accommodation of foot passengers proceeding to and from the railway station (with which the bridge afforded the only means of communication, except by a ferry) was crowded.As the clown approached, all the persons flocked to the south side of the bridge, and the effect was to flatten the crown of the bridge so perceptibly that it was noticed from the shore. Before any warning could be given ‚Äì before an alarm could be made, a crack was heard; one after another rails and chains gave way; the south side of the bridge fell down, hanging nearly perpendicularly to the water, and all its occupants, men, women, and children, were precipitated, those in the background being literally pitched over the heads of the foremost ones, into the Bure.The effect of the shock on the spectators that lined both sides of the river was electrical. A wild shriek rent the air, but the sufferers were mute. An eyewitness affirms that they shrieked, spoke not ‚Äì engulfed in the yawning waters they were heard no more. The wild cry of agony was succeeded by the most active efforts to rescue the sufferers. Almost the first saved were between 20 and 30 young girls, who were taken to Mr. Franklin's, the Vauxhall Gardens, where every attention that humanity could suggest was shown them. The boatmen exerted themselves with energy, and brought many to land; and whilst there were a good many in whom the breath of life was still vivid, the greater number were inanimate corpses.The accident took place about 10 minutes or a quarter after six o'clock, and before eight, 53 dead bodies had been conveyed to the Norwich Arms public house; others were taken to the Admiral Collingwood and to the Swan; and many to their own houses. The process of dragging was continued as long as a gleam of light remained, and renewed early in the morning. Before seven o'clock on Saturday, 90 bodies had been found and brought to shore.Several acts of gallantry were performed. Two men, named Smith and Creake, swam about and saved several persons. The son of Mr. Sloman, the bookseller, was one of those immersed in the water. A gallant fellow, whose name could not be ascertained, who was also one of those who fell from the bridge, having extricated himself from the sinking throng, took young Sloman under one arm, and another child under the other, and succeeded in reaching the shore ‚Äì saving both. A poor woman, who, with her child, was thrown from the bridge, supported her infant by holding its clothes with her teeth, and thus having her hands at liberty, she providentially got clear from the sinking bodies, and reached the shore in safety. Another poor creature was not so successful. She was found with a child, three years old in her arms, and firmly grasping another. All were dead! One man, in the act of falling, snatched at the bridge, and grappling it, hung fast. A woman got hold of his feet, and he told her to hold on. She was rescued, and he ultimately fell into the stream, but was saved.The original reporting said that the mass-casualty event caused Cooke, the man responsible for the stunt with the clown, bathtub, and geese, to experience ""a very deep feeling of distress."" The story also described perhaps upwards of 94 people were initially believed to have died. That number was later reduced to an official count of 79 deaths.The newspaper article from 1845 also included these eyewitness accounts, which we have transcribed to make them searchable on the internet:A youth, named J. B. Thorndike, deposed that he was on the suspension bridge when the accident took place. He stood in the carriage way, and in about the center of the bridge. He heard a cracking noise, and observed that one of the connecting links had broken, the ends of the severed link being about two inches apart. He did not apprehend any danger from what he saw. There was, however, a sudden rush to the Yarmouth shore; but several persons laughed, and then ran back to their places. To the best of his belief five or ten minutes elapsed between that time and the time when the bridge fell, when he, with others, was immersed in the water.By the Foreman. ‚Äì ""I had been on the bridge about five minutes before I heard the crack. It was crowded with people. There were a great many persons upon it, but they were not so thick as I have seen them. I should say they were about four deep. The bridge was not half full. Sufficient time elapsed between my first observing the link break and the bridge falling for everyone upon it to have gone off. I saw more persons on the bridge by a good many upon the occasion of the prisoners who were lately accused of what was called 'the Yarmouth murder' returning from Norwich after their acquittal.""Some 114 years later, the Liverpool Echo published a 1959 column that shed more light on the full outcome of the investigation into the disaster. The cause of the tragedy, beyond the immense weight of the hundreds of people who had gathered on the bridge to watch the clown and geese, was found to have been a ""welding defect"":Tales of miraculous escapes were told at the inquest. One man fell across a piece of iron that had mercifully wedged itself into the bank, so that his head was above water. Grabbing two girls struggling nearby, he hung on to them until all three were saved.One mother seized her child's clothing in her mouth as she and her daughter were catapulted into the river. Breaking surface, she laboriously paddled both to safety. Wherries rescued others so near exhaustion that they had insufficient strength to raise themselves out of the water.The inquest's final verdict found a welding defect responsible for the tragedy and condemned the inferior materials and labour used to build the bridge only 16 years earlier as not being to the standards specified in the original contract.‚Ä¶Of Cooke, the circus owner, and Nelson, his clown, nothing further is known. But ironically, the handbill announcing the ""grand gala night"" was prefaced with the words, ""Is it to be a Benefit or Not? That is the Question.""Great Yarmouth has no doubt of the answer.Around 168 years after the deadly accident, BBC.com reported in 2013 that a memorial had been erected to remember the lives that were lost."	true
5762	A scientific study demonstrated that conspiracy theorists are generally more sane than other people.	"Back in 2014, the decidedly pro-conspiracy website Natural News, whose founder Mike Adams sometimes serves as a guest host for Alex Jones‚Äô Infowars, gleefully exclaimed that science had proved conspiracy theorists are generally ‚Äúmore sane‚Äù than people who hold more ‚Äúconformist‚Äù views -- as evidenced by their publication of an article headlined ‚ÄúScientific Study Reveals Conspiracy Theorists the Most Sane of All.‚ÄùIn point of fact, the study referenced in that article, whose sole dataset comprised comments left by readers of news articles that included the term ‚Äú9/11‚Äù and similar keywords, did not make such a claim. That paper, titled ‚Äú‚ÄòWhat About Building 7?‚Äô A Social Psychological Study of Online Discussion of 9/11 Conspiracy Theories‚Äù made a series of qualitative observations based on 2,174 collected comments, as follows:
We found that conspiracist commenters were more likely to argue against the opposing interpretation and less likely to argue in favor of their own interpretation, while the opposite was true of conventionalist commenters. Conspiracist comments were more likely to explicitly put forward an account than conventionalist comments were.Conspiracists were more likely to express mistrust and made more positive and fewer negative references to other conspiracy theories. Conspiracists were largely unwilling to apply the ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù label to their own beliefs and objected when others did so, lending support to the long-held suggestion that conspiracy belief carries a social stigma.Conventionalist arguments tended to have a more hostile tone.
Natural News derived their assertion that ‚Äúconspiracists‚Äù are ‚Äúmore sane‚Äù from combining the latter observation about tone with their own severely flawed understanding of sampling biases:
The researchers noted that they were surprised to find that it is now more conventional to leave so-called conspiracist comments than conventional ones. ""Of the 2174 comments collected, 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalist,"" the researchers wrote ...That means the pro-conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom, while the anti-conspiracy commenters represent a small, beleaguered minority that is often scoffed at and shunned.
That inherently flawed interpretation relied on the somewhat terrifying assumption that the views expressed in the comments section of news articles about the September 11th terrorist attacks were a representative cross-section of the population as a whole, a rather harrowing notion. In fact, it should be unsurprising that the majority of the comments collected by the researchers were pro-conspiracy theory, as that is explicitly the kind of comment the researchers searched for:
For each article that resulted from these searches [of keywords such as ""9/11""], the public comment sections were read, and from these, we extracted verbatim all relevant comments regarding the 9/11 conspiracy theories.
The study did not even capture a representative sample of the comments left on news stories about 9/11, much less the views of the broader population about 9/11. Therefore, the study cannot be used to make the claim that ‚Äúpro-conspiracy commenters are those who are now expressing what is considered conventional wisdom.‚ÄùWith regard to the tone of comments, it is unclear where Natural News got the idea that the hostile tone of a comment responding to a 9/11 conspiracy indicates a lack of sanity, but the study at no point makes any claim about comparative sanity levels.The study did conclude, however, that ‚Äúconspiracism is rooted in several higher-order beliefs such as an abiding mistrust of authority, the conviction that nothing is quite as it seems, and the belief that most of what we are told is a lie.‚Äù The study also noted that their results aligned with previous observations ‚Äúthat conspiracy theories rely heavily on ‚Äòerrant data‚Äô rather than on crafting coherent alternative explanations.‚Äù"	false
2634	In 2021, Guinness World Records named paint developed by researchers at Purdue University the world's whitest.	"In September 2021, Snopes saw social media posts claiming researchers at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, had invented a paint that received a Guinness World Records title for the being the whitest in existence.The assertion was accurate.In a Sept. 20 news release, the university announced the 2022 edition of Guinness World Records features the paint formula developed by¬† mechanical engineering Professor Xiulin Ruan and his graduate students. Additionally, the website for the records indeed lists the Purdue researchers' ""barium sulphate paint"" as the world's whitest.But that isn't the paint's only special quality.The paint made news headlines months earlier in spring 2021, soon after the American Chemical Society published a report¬†written by Ruan's team.In that publication, as well as an April news release by Purdue, the researchers explained how the white paint reflects up to 98.1% of sunlight, and simultaneously sends infrared heat away from its surface ‚Äî a process that could help keep buildings cool without so much air conditioning, unlike similarly designed products. (For comparison, other paints that aim to reject heat only reflect 80%-90% of sunlight and do not contain properties to make surfaces cooler than their surroundings, according to the release.)‚ÄúIf you were to use this paint to cover a roof area of about 1,000 square feet, we estimate that you could get a cooling power of 10 kilowatts. That‚Äôs more powerful than the central air conditioners used by most houses,‚Äù Ruan said in the April release.In other words, the paint has the potential to help buildings rely less on air conditioning systems that are responsible for a portion of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the researchers.The Guinness World Records' website stated:Such paints are considered to be a potential game-changer for keeping the planet ‚Äî particularly cities ‚Äî cooler and reducing electricity use; buildings with a coating of this would need to rely far less on energy-hungry air conditioning. [...][The] scientists estimate that it would only require 0.5‚Äì1% of Earth‚Äôs surface to be coated in this paint (e.g., by painting roofs) to reverse global warming to date.As of April, Ruan's team was working with a company to produce and sell the paint, according to the BBC.""I already had an inquiry from a museum that wants to put up a display of our whitest white paint side by side with the blackest black,"" he told the news outlet.See also:"	true
5805	Some 600 murders took place in Chicago during the second weekend of August 2018.	"On 14 August 2018, Omarosa Manigault Newman, former Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison in the Trump administration, appeared on the Daily Show to talk about her new tell-all book, Unhinged.  Although the conversation primarily focused on the former Apprentice contestant's experiences in the Trump White House, Omarosa also dropped a curious statistic about the number of murders in Chicago.While criticizing President Trump for not living up to his campaign promise to reduce violence in Chicago, Omarosa declared that the Second City had seen ""600 murders over this weekend."" That comment can be heard around the 6-minute mark of the following video:That claim was absurd.Omarosa appeared to be referring to the number of murders that had occurred over the previous weekend,  but the number of people killed in Chicago over the second weekend in August wasn't even close to 600. According to NBC Chicago, the actual number of people murdered that weekend was one:A 29-year-old woman is dead and at least 30 others have been wounded in weekend gun violence across the city since Friday afternoon.The Chicago Tribune reported similar statistics:There were no mass shootings reported this past weekend. And the total number of people shot ‚Äî one killed and at least 36 wounded ‚Äî is not uncommon for summer weekends in Chicago when the weather draws more people into the streets.No Chicago weekend in 2018 was as deadly as Omarosa claimed. In fact, according to the Tribune, the city hadn't seen 600 murders throughout all of 2018 up to that point:
So far this year, at least 1,869 people have been shot and there have been at least 334 homicides, according to data collected by the Tribune. That‚Äôs lower than the past two years, when violence reached levels not seen in two decades, but higher than other recent years.As far as we can tell, no weekend in the recent history of Chicago has seen the amount of murders claimed by Omarosa. While the number of homicides in Chicago reached 900 during a few years in the 1970s and 1990s, the majority of years (let alone weekends) over the last several decades didn't see 600 murders:This is the second time in recent weeks that number of murders in Chicago has been grossly exaggerated by a member (or former member) of President Trump's team. The president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, claimed in a tweet that 63 murders were recorded over the first weekend in August 2018 in Chicago:63 murders this weekend in Rahm Emmanuel‚Äôs Chicago. His legacy more murders in his city than ever before. It‚Äôs only because of Democrat brain washing that he has even a chance of remaining. Support police professional Garry McCarthy.‚Äî Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) August 6, 2018The weekend Giuliani was referring to, however, saw 63 people shot, not murdered. Only 12 people were killed during the first weekend of August."	false

This image was posted to that Instagram page on April 24, 2020, along with a caption identifying the image as ""art.""Makeeva wrote: ""Art 2020 ‚ñ™Ô∏è when people stay at home - city is filled with other residents.""While Makeeva labeled this image as ""Art,"" many people who viewed the image on Instagram were still curious if this was a real photograph. Makeeva responded to many of these commentators and informed them that ""no,"" this was not a real photograph:The Instagram page for @Hobopeeba is full of similarly fantastical images. The biography for this page also notes that Makeeva is a ""Photographer & cat & engineer-wizard from Moscow"" and a ""Modern converter from ordinary to magic.""Interestingly, this image went viral as a similar, but real, scene played out in Mumbai.

The Science Times calculates around 150,000 flamingos have come to the area.Here's a photograph from Getty Images showing this large flock of flamingos in India:"	false
5559	"The Macomb County Police Department held a press conference about a potential ""vigilante"" serial killer after three pedophiles were murdered in one week."	"Many social media users encountered a September 2018 news article reporting that law enforcement agencies in a Michigan county were on the lookout for a ""vigilante"" serial killer after three pedophiles were murdered in the span of one week. A version of this junk news article published on the NBC 9 News website (which has no affiliation with the real NBC News) stated that the murders had occurred in Longview, Texas, while a near-verbatim copy published on another website falsely posing as a local news outlet, CBS News 15, asserted that the killer was on the loose in Macomb County, Michigan:The former version read as follows:
Law enforcement officials in Longview, Texas, have held a press conference to announce they believe a vigilante targeting pedophiles is on the loose, with reports that three local offenders have been found dead over the past week.Authorities are appealing for any information regarding the murders, which have claimed the lives of three men on the Texas Sex Offender Registry for crimes involving offences against children.‚ÄúWe urge whoever is committing these murders to stop immediately and turn themselves in,‚Äù said one officer. ‚ÄúWhile we understand the community‚Äôs attitude to pedophiles, there is no way in a civilised society that we can accept this sort of vigilantism.‚ÄùThe reason for the discrepancy over location, of course, was that this story was just another bit of junk news.A common tactic among purveyors of junk news is to focus their fictions on specific geographic locations. A disreputable website can set the same fake news story in a variety of locations in order to spread misinformation broadly outwards from smaller communities with minimal effort. In 2016 we saw a rash of this type of story claiming that [insert celebrity name] was moving to, had kind things to say about, or was serving jury duty in, [insert name of small town].Police departments in both Macomb County, Michigan, and Longview, Texas, responded to this hoax on Facebook to reassure their communities that no serial killers were on the loose in those localities: "	false
729	The creator of Pok√©mon said in an interview that the game is anti-Christian, and was developed with Satanists in mind.	In July 2016, the internet was flooded with stories (some true, many¬†false) about Nintendo's widely popular new game, Pok√©mon GO.¬†The game's popularity even managed to resurrect an old, fake interview with the game's creator,¬†Satoshi Tajiri, in which he purportedly stated that Pok√©mon¬†was deliberately anti-Christian, and more than that, was created with Satanists in mind:In a rare interview with¬†Pok√©mon creator Satoshi Tajiri, he admits that the games were created as a backlash against his Christian parents. He also says that the games are tailored towards an anti-Christian sentiment or Satanism.The interview, conducted by Time about the continued success of the¬†Pok√©mon series, took a sharp left turn when Tajiri was asked about the inspiration for the games. The following is an excerpt from the interview:[...]Tajiri: Yes. Pok√©mon is essentially the correct answer towards life, not Christianity. Everything presented in the game is the opposite of what Christians may believe. Some have said that the game promotes voodoo or magic, and I agree in the sense that there are many things that occur in nature that are unexplainable. Furthermore, the violence in the games is unparalleled. It may not show up in the actual graphics, but the brutality is made especially explicit in the Pok√©dex entries. Nature, again, played a big role.Time: So those who say that the game is anti-Christian are correct?Tajiri: I suppose so. I mean, some could say that the game supports Satanism. I don't officially celebrate it, but I can understand why people would be attracted to it.The¬†interview displayed above is a work of humorous fiction that was¬†originally published on gaming site¬†Play4Real¬†on 7 November 2012.¬†Tajiri did, however, give a real interview to¬†TIME magazine, which¬†was published¬†in November 1999:After first coming up with the idea for Pok√©mon in 1990, Satoshi Tajiri labored for nearly six years over the original game. Now 34, he based it partly on things he remembered as a kid. The careful attention paid off. Pok√©mon swept Japan and is now doing the same in the U.S. and beyond. Spinoffs include trading cards as closely held as stock options, a TV series and, now, a movie.Tajiri's real interview with¬†TIME¬†was mostly about the origin of the¬†game and its unique design. Tajiri said that it came from several different aspects of his childhood (he collected bugs¬†and liked manga comics) and he only mentioned inspiration when saying that he¬†got his best ideas when he was¬†sleep deprived:It's the way I work. I sleep 12 hours and then work 24 hours. I've worked those irregular hours for the past three years. It's better to stay up day and night to come up with ideas. I usually get inspiration for game designing by working this schedule.Satanism did not come up¬†during¬†the interview.	false
544	After a haphazard reversal of who would lose blue checkmarks on Twitter, CEO Elon Musk tweeted, ‚ÄúAhh fuck it, I‚Äôm closing this site, fuck you and fuck Twitter, I can never post a single goddamn thread in here without you tweeters making tweets in some way or another.

Previously, the check mark was free and granted to those who went through an identity verification process, particularly journalists, famous people, and companies.¬†On¬†April 20, Twitter began stripping blue check marks from public figures who chose not to opt into the paid service, including celebrities and journalists who had been verified before Musk's takeover.

1686	The Paradise Adventist Academy in California received around $13,000 in donations as well as new uniforms and clothes from an opponent in a game played shortly after their hometown was destroyed by the Camp Fire.	"At least one account of generosity stemming from the devastating Camp Fire in California in November 2018 can be verified as true.As the Grass Valley Union newspaper and other news outlets reported, the Paradise Adventist Academy girls' volleyball team arrived to compete in a California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) playoff game on 10 November 2018 to find that their opponents at Forest Lake Christian High School had provided them with both material and financial support.After the game, Forest Lake athletic director LaRon Gordon announced that local parents and students had donated around $16,000 as well as shoes, clothes, and toiletries to their opponents as well as gift cards for each individual player. Gordon's team also gave Paradise Adventist new jerseys, shorts, and knee pads to use for the contest, which was a semifinal match in the Northern California Division VI regional tournament.Forest Lake also received permission from the CIF to forego charging admission to the game in favor of donating all tickets sales to help victims of the fire.""I've never been so overwhelmed by so many things I would have never thought possible, and this is one of the most amazing things I could ever have thought would happen,"" Paradise Adventist head coach Jason Eyer said following the announcement. ""Your community is awesome. We will be forever grateful.""Gordon's announcement was also captured in a video posted online:Forest Lake won the game in four sets, though they lost the Division IV regional final to Stone Ridge Christian out of Merced, California, three days later. (We contacted Eyer seeking further comment about his team's memorable away game but did not receive a response prior to publication.)The fire, which erupted on 8 November 2018, had killed 77 people as of 18 November 2018, with another 1,276 people listed as missing in its aftermath. It consumed nearly the entirety of the town of Paradise, a small community in Butte County in northern California, and forced evacuations in several other cities including: Paradise; Centerville; Yankee Hill; Concow; and Butte Creek Canyon.It was also the cause of another disagreement between President Donald Trump and California Gov. Jerry Brown: while Brown cited the fire as a consequence of climate change, the president blamed what he called poor management for the blaze, eliding the fact that some 60 percent of California state forests are under management by federal agencies.More than 50,000 people were reportedly displaced by the blaze, and air quality across the Bay Area decreased as a result of smoke produced by the fire.

2053	Dolly Parton was on life support on Sept. 4, 2022.	"In early September 2022, we received messages from readers asking asked if the rumor was true that American music icon Dolly Parton was ""currently on life support."" This was false.The baseless rumor appeared to begin on YouTube with a video titled, ""5 Minutes Ago/Dolly Parton Is Currently On Life Support After Diagnosed With Dangerous Disease."" We found no credible reporting that mentioned anything about Parton's health being in jeopardy. Further, no part of the video's six minutes and 50 seconds mentioned anything about Parton being ""on life support"" or experiencing a ""dangerous disease.""The clip was published on YouTube on Sept. 4 and was viewed nearly 22,000 times in its first two days. It was also shared on both Facebook and Twitter.The video that falsely claimed Parton was on life support was published on the YouTube channel Recuerda Gente Famosa. The channel appeared to publish nothing but false news about celebrities either dying or being on the brink of death.Celebrities in film and music who were featured in recent misleading videos on the channel included Michael Douglas, Tom Selleck, Dick Van Dyke, Barry Gibb, Garth Brooks, Linda Hamilton, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, Clint Eastwood, Jack Nicholson, Desi Arnaz Jr., Arnold Schwarzenegger, Stevie Nicks, Willie Nelson, Priscilla Presley, Keith Urban, and so many others.In sum, no, the video that was titled ""Dolly Parton Is Currently On Life Support"" was not true. The YouTube channel where it originated does not publish credible news stories."	false
3765	In November 2020, Madame Tussauds in London replaced the business suit on its effigy of Donald Trump with a golfing outfit.	"In late 2020, after President-elect Joe Biden's projected victory in the Nov. 3 U.S. general election, social media posts and news reports claimed that Madame Tussauds, the world-famous wax museum in London, had changed the clothes on its effigy of outgoing President Donald Trump from a business suit to golf attire.On Dec. 7, U.S. presidential historian Michael Beschloss tweeted a photograph of what appeared to be the replacement of the clothing in progress, along with the following caption:""Madame Tussaud‚Äôs waxworks in London reports that it has already redressed its effigy of the American President to wear retirement golf clothes.""Articles to the same effect were published by the Huffington Post and New York Daily News, among others.Those descriptions were accurate.

5708	In an interview with Fox News in September 2018, Madonna said she regretted not voting for Donald Trump in 2016 and would support him in 2020.	"The celebrity political endorsement is a common trope in the online misinformation sphere. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, and continuing afterwards, junk news web sites famously produced fake stories claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed then-candidate Donald Trump (as well as Bernie Sanders), that left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore had also endorsed Trump, and that actors Denzel Washington and Brad Pitt had as well.In September 2018, Facebook users shared a fabricated Trump endorsement meme from Madonna, who purportedly said she ""regretted"" voting against Trump in 2016 and intended to support him in 2020:In reality, Madonna said nothing of the sort on Fox News (or anywhere else), in September 2018 (or at any other time). The singer and actor has been on poor terms with Donald Trump for many years (as outlined by Rolling Stone magazine) and has spoken out against him since his election.In January 2017, Madonna spoke at the Women's March in Washington, D.C., a mass demonstration for women's rights and progressive causes centered around opposition to the newly sworn-in president. She called Trump's election a ""horrific moment of darkness"" and said she had ""thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House"" (a phrase she later clarified was intended as a metaphor). In response, Trump called Madonna ""disgusting"":"	false
2409	"Rebecca Black's song ""Friday"" has no dislikes on YouTube."	"On Dec. 6, 2021, a Reddit post seemed to indicate that Rebecca Black's 2011 song ""Friday"" had no dislikes on YouTube. It read: ""1.3 million likes and no dislikes. This song must be a banger.""However, u/sage6paths, the user who created the Reddit post, appeared to be making a joke and knew the truth of why her video showed no dislikes. Others on Reddit and in the video's YouTube comments also understood why the video showed no dislikes. However, some users were still perhaps perplexed. It's important to remember that not all readers are up-to-date on the latest tech news. Sometimes, the ""obvious"" is not always obvious to everyone.Here's why Black's ""Friday"" doesn't show a number next to the ""Dislike"" button.In November 2021, it was announced that the number of dislikes on all YouTube videos would be hidden from public view. This policy was put into place to dissuade users from banding together to harass content creators.The act of gathering together and coordinating dislikes is often referred to as ""brigading"" or ""ratioing."" The idea from those seeking to ""ratio"" a YouTube video is to see how high they can get the clip's dislike count to be compared to the number of likes. (On Twitter, the aim of trying to ""ratio"" a tweet is to make it have more replies than it does retweets and likes.)For those unfamiliar with the ""Dislike"" button, it's shown under YouTube videos as a thumb pointing down: As of November 2021, a new YouTube policy now hides the number of dislikes on all videos in order to prevent harassment and brigading.¬†
After the policy was put into place, a number no longer showed up for dislikes under Black's ""Friday"" or any videos at all. The ""Dislike"" button still showed up and functioned as usual. However, the public wouldn't be able to see the number. The dislike counts can now only be seen by content creators who have credentials to manage accounts.On Nov. 11, NBC News reported on how YouTube came up with the idea:The updated feature was sparked by an experiment YouTube conducted earlier this year to see whether changes to the dislike button could help protect content creators from harassment and ""dislike attacks,"" where viewers purposely dislike a video to drive up the count.Researchers at the site found that if the dislike count is hidden viewers were ""less likely to target a video‚Äôs dislike button to drive up the count,"" a press release states.""In short, our experiment data showed a reduction in dislike attacking behavior. We also heard directly from smaller creators and those just getting started that they are unfairly targeted by this behavior ‚Äî and our experiment confirmed that this does occur at a higher proportion on smaller channels,"" the release says.Before YouTube enacted the new policy, Black's song ""Friday"" likely had around 4 million dislikes, according to several tweets we found.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0

One past example of a YouTube video being brigaded was in the case of the ""Ghostbusters"" movie trailer in 2016. For the first time in the franchise, four leading women were cast in new roles instead of four men, which was believed to have led to a scourge of dislikes."	false
5067	"A 2018 survey deemed the United States to be ""one of the ten worst countries in the world to be a woman."""	"Many social media users have expressed disbelief and dismay at a graphic indicating that the United States had been deemed ""one of the ten worst countries in the world to be a woman,"" rounding out a list headed by India, Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Yemen, and Nigeria:The basis of the graphic was a 2018 survey compiled by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the ""charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.""This item is therefore superficially ""true"" in the sense that it reflects the results of a genuine poll, but of course the significance of any particular survey or poll depends upon its methodology. In this case, Thomson Reuters polled 548 experts on women's issues by phone and in person between March 26 and May 4, 2018. The respondents were evenly spread across Europe, Africa, the Americas, South East Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific, and included ""aid professionals, academics, healthcare staff, non-government organisation workers, policy-makers, development specialists and social commentators.""According to Thomson Reuters, ""the survey asked respondents which five of the 193 United Nations member states they thought were most dangerous for women and which country was worst in terms of healthcare, economic resources, cultural or traditional practices, sexual violence and harassment, non-sexual violence and human trafficking.""Still, Americans (and others) were left puzzled by how the United States could rank so highly in such a survey, given that many of the phenomena that contributed to the other countries' being declared dangerous and unhealthy places for women ‚Äî female infanticide, forced marriages, sex slavery, domestic servitude, death by stoning, civil war, restricted access to health care ‚Äî have little to no prevalence in the U.S.The explanation offered by Thomson Reuters was that the influence of the #MeToo movement and the Time's Up campaign, which were running concurrently with the poll, influenced the results sufficiently to push the U.S. into the top 10:Experts said the surprise addition of the United States in the top 10 most dangerous countries for women came down to the #MeToo and Time's Up campaigns against sexual harassment and violence that have dominated headlines for months.""People want to think income means you're protected from misogyny, and sadly that's not the case,"" said Cindy Southworth, executive vice president of the Washington-based National Network to End Domestic Violence."	true
4153	A video showed a rare, yellow turtle discovered in India in July 2020.	A viral video shared to Twitter in July 2020 showed a scuttling lemon-hued turtle that was reportedly rescued by residents of a village in southeastern India.Snopes' readers asked us to verify and indeed the video is real.¬†Asian News International reported that the turtle was ‚Äúrescued‚Äù by locals in the southeastern Indian state of Odisha on July 18, 2020. The individuals then notified the Indian Forest Service (IFS). Susanta Nanda, who works with the agency, wrote on Twitter that the turtle‚Äôs visibly pink eye is indicative of albinism, a rare inherited disorder.Albinism is a genetic condition that results in a reduction or the complete absence of melanin, the pigment responsible for coloring in the skin and eyes, according to the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation. In mammals ‚Äî including humans ‚Äî the Mayo Clinic notes that different mutations in melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin, can result in different types of albinism. This lack of pigment allows for the retina to be seen through the iris and can make the eyes appear red or pink.Albinism has also been observed in reptiles, birds, amphibians, and even insects. Although nearly any vertebrate animal can inherit albino genes, the condition is thought to present differently in reptiles and birds. In September 2017, about one in four recently hatched green sea turtles from one clutch were recorded by scientists as albino and described in the Marine Turtle Newsletter. Researchers noted that in birds and snakes, albinism is an ‚Äúautosomal recessive trait‚Äù and a similar genetic process is believed to also occur in sea turtles. Recessive traits result from genes that must be contributed by both parents in order to be expressed in their offspring.Despite their Twitter-friendly appearance, albino turtles probably suffer high mortality rates as they are unable to effectively camouflage in their environments and are more likely to suffer from other health defects associated with the condition.	true
889	Allegations against country superstar Dolly Parton have been confirmed. Also, she endorsed CBD or keto gummies.	"In December 2022, we were asked by readers about Facebook ads that mentioned purported ""allegations"" against country superstar Dolly Parton having been ""confirmed."" The ads, which mentioned Parton by name and featured pictures of her, led to articles that claimed she had endorsed CBD or keto gummies that could ""reverse dementia.""However, all of this was false. No allegations were revealed after clicking the ads, and she never endorsed CBD or keto gummies.A simple search of Facebook showed that scammers were using Parton's image and likeness without authorization.All of the Facebook ads showed the false headline, ""Allegation Against Dolly Parton Have Been Confirmed."" (The word ""allegation"" was singular, but likely was meant to be the plural form, ""allegations."")The ads led to websites that had been created by scammers to look just like FoxNews.com, apparently with the goal of convincing people that Parton had added her stamp of approval to various CBD or keto gummies products. Again, she never endorsed any gummies.The scammy article was hosted on several websites that had recently been registered on namesilo.com¬†in either November or December 2022.¬†All of them were .mom domains.A handful of the scam websites we found included rewoheta.mom, asamavoy.mom, utiseser.mom, ololacey.mom, owilogal.mom, aherahas.mom, and olinener.mom.Scammers copied the page design from FoxNews.com and created new .mom websites with the same look, all to fool readers into believing they were reading the news organization's official website. In reality, Fox News had no involvement with this scam.All of the .mom websites used an inline frame (iframe) to hide the fake FoxNews.com article from anyone trying to access the article outside of a link clicked on Facebook. Instead, the page showed a fake online store for clothing (example) or other items, which was a failed attempt to mask the scam from anyone attempting to investigate the activity.The headline in the article read, ""Dolly Parton reverses dementia solution sparks huge lawsuit pressure on Fox, she finally fights back on air.""(Fox) - In an Exclusive Interview, Dolly Parton, American country music singer, actress and businesswoman reveals that the show will be ending after her latest business sparks tension with Martha MacCallum.During a heated episode last week, ""the Queen of Country"" Dolly Parton made headlines after revealing her new CBD line on Live TV. Martha MacCallum was outraged saying she will be filing a lawsuit against Dolly Parton and Fox for violating her contract and 'scaring-off' sponsors. Dolly Parton responded with this:""I know Martha is just coming after my timeslot. I am not giving in to 'Cancel Culture'. When I started this whole thing back in 2018, it really was just a part time passion project and a way for me to give back. After being given so much, I figured there was no better time to make [these] CBD Gummies available to everyone, as it can help thousands of people experience life pain-free and live much happier lives.""...Dolly Parton eventually admitted that although Martha MacCallum is enraged, other Fox hosts has been supportive of her. Tucker Carlson even went on Live TV to say that: ""[This line of] CBD Gummies has completely changed my life and it's clear that MacCallum is attempting a Coup.""According to the scammy and completely fictional article, Parton endorsed a CBD or keto gummies product that could ""reverse dementia,"" and she was even giving out free samples. None of this was true.Specific products misleading mentioned as having been endorsed by Parton included Supreme CBD Gummies, Jolly Nutrition CBD Gummies, Proper CBD Gummies, and others."	false
50	Sam Elliott was dead, as of August 2023.	"In August 2023, claims circulated on social media platforms that actor Sam Elliott had died. He had not. The rumor was nothing more than a death hoax.The false rumor spread via at least two YouTube videos. For example, on Aug. 2, 2023, a YouTube video was posted titled, ""Sam Elliott Tribute."" The thumbnail for the video showed 1944, the year he was born, and 2023. ""Let's keep the legacy of Sam Elliott alive and kicking,"" the video claimed. The following day, another YouTube video was posted under the title, ""10 Minutes Ago! American Actor Sam Elliott His Last Goodbye On His Deathbed #whodiedtoday."" The video's description box read, ""Today, we're saying goodbye to a true Hollywood legend, Sam Elliott.""We also found posts with the false claim about Elliott on platforms such as¬†Twitter and Facebook. We reached out to his publicist with a request for comment about the claim, and we will update this fact-check if we¬†receive a response.The YouTube videos mentioned above originated from channels that are not reputable sources of news about celebrity deaths. The first video titled ""Sam Elliott Tribute"" was¬†posted by the¬†channel ""Ripples In Time,"" which described itself on its ""About""¬†page as a channel dedicated to ""old movies, classic movies, old TV shows, documentaries, History and much more."" Meanwhile, the other video was posted by the channel¬†""Celeb Breaking News,"" and that channel appeared to be dedicated to death hoaxes. At the time of this writing, the channel had posted death hoax videos about country singer Luke Bryan, boxer Mike Tyson, and ""America's Got Talent"" judge Simon Cowell within two days.Furthermore, had Elliot really died, reputable news publications, such as The Associated Press, would have memorialized him with¬†obituaries on their websites. That had not happened.At least two websites ‚Äî¬†Sportskeedia and the U.S. edition of¬†The Sun¬†tabloid ‚Äî wrote about Elliott being¬†targeted by the death hoax, citing an alleged Facebook post that supposedly claimed he had died on Aug. 4, 2023. We could not find that purported Facebook post, nor an archived version of it if it had been deleted, as of this writing.¬†Additionally, both Sportskeedia and The Sun published an alleged statement by a representative of Elliott, reading, ""He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet.""¬†The Sun did not cite where or how it¬†supposedly obtained that statement, though Sportskeedia credited the satirical website Mediamass¬†as its source. Mediamass has a history of spreading celebrity death hoaxes that go viral. On Mediamass' pages about¬†Tim Curry and Steve Harvey,¬†for example, the alleged statement about Elliott (""He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized..."") was repeated verbatim, though intended to be about Curry and Harvey.August 2023 was not the first time the internet targeted Elliot with a death hoax.

2663	"In 2001 or 2002, Rudy Giuliani ""turned down"" a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II, because it would have required his relinquishing his U.S. citizenship."	"In September 2021, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani made an expletive-ridden and at times rambling public speech, during which he impersonated Queen Elizabeth and drifted between anecdotes about his time as a federal prosecutor, and the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.¬†The speech provided fodder for late night talk show hosts, and prompted widespread speculation that Giuliani, a prominent ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, may have been drunk during his appearance at an event to commemorate the 20th anniversary of 9/11 ‚Äî allegations that Giuliani has denied.¬†In one widely-shared moment from his Sept. 11 speech, Giuliani claimed he had ""turned down a knighthood,"" because accepting it would have meant relinquishing U.S. citizenship:While it's true that only U.K. or Commonwealth citizens can be given full or ""substantive"" knighthoods, foreign recipients are simply not given the option of suddenly acquiring U.K. citizenship in order to receive a ""full"" honor. Rather, they are awarded only ""honorary"" awards, as Giuliani was. We are issuing a rating of ""False.""Giuliani's speech can be watched in full here (the relevant remarks begin around 3:09:25). At one point, Giuliani recalled the considerable difficulty associated with shepherding the city of New York through the aftermath of such an unprecedented and horrifying attack, then segued into a discussion of his honorary knighthood:I think what got me through it is ‚Äî I don't want to sound like a name-dropper, but I told this to the queen of England. She said [affects accent] ""You did a wonderful job on September 11th. And therefore I'm making you an honorary knight commander of the royal something-or-other."" I turned down a knighthood, because if you took a knighthood you had to lose your citizenship.¬†...[Prince Andrew] told me ""My mummy wants to make you a knight""... I said ""Well what does it entail?"" He said ""Well if you want to be a full knight you have to give up your citizenship""... I said ""I think I'll turn that down. Do we have an alternative?"" He said ""Yes, you can do what Ronald Reagan did."" I said ""Anything Ronald Reagan does, I'll do."" He said ""You can be an honorary knight.""So when she gave it to me and to Bernie and to Tom, right after, she said to me ""You did a wonderful job...""Giuliani is referring to the episode, in February 2002, when Queen Elizabeth bestowed an honorary knighthood on three prominent public officials associated with New York's response to the attacks of Sept. 11: Former mayor Giuliani; former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik; and former FDNY Commissioner Tom Von Essen. News footage from that episode can be watched below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeiogSfMibs
¬†
There's no doubt that Giuliani was offered, and gratefully accepted, an honorary knighthood, in 2002. So how does this track with his claim, 19 years later, that he ""turned down a knighthood""?¬†Twice each year ‚Äî in June, to mark her official birthday, and on New Year's Eve ‚Äî Queen Elizabeth bestows various honors and awards on hundreds of people, as a way of formally recognizing their contributions to various aspects of public life, including business, charity, sports, culture, and so on.While formally, it is the monarch who confers those honors, the lists of recipients are recommended by various ""honors committees,"" who forward their recommendations to a main honors committee. From there, the lists are vetted by the U.K. Prime Minister and government, who submit the names to Buckingham Palace.¬†The honors are separated into various different orders, with some being more exclusive, and regarded as higher honors, than others.¬† While most recipients are either citizens of the U.K., or citizens of the Commonwealth (countries such as Australia and New Zealand, whose head of state is Queen Elizabeth), some are neither U.K. nor Commonwealth citizens.¬†Non-British and non-Commonwealth recipients are given ""honorary"" awards. For example, in 1989 former U.S. President Ronald Reagan was given an honorary knighthood, and made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath, to which Giuliani alluded in his 2021 speech. Other prominent Americans to have received honorary knighthoods include George H.W. Bush (1993), Steven Spielberg (2001), and Bill Gates (2005).Foreign recipients of honorary awards are entitled to place the relevant initials after their name, but cannot use any associated honorifics, such as ""Sir"" or ""Dame,"" because they are not U.K. or Commonwealth citizens. Giuliani was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, a very significant honor. As such, he is entitled to style himself ""Rudy Giuliani KBE,"" but cannot style himself ""Sir Rudy Giuliani.""Interestingly, recipients of honorary awards can convert those to ""substantive"" awards, if they later obtain U.K. citizenship, such as was the case with the well-known Irish broadcaster Terry Wogan, who received an honorary knighthood in the queen's birthday honors in June 2005. After Wogan obtained U.K. citizenship, his knighthood was ""made substantive"" in the New Year's honors list, on Dec. 31, 2005.However, that process was not available to Giuliani, because he did not meet the standard requirements for obtaining U.K. citizenship, such as residency in the country.While there was a grain of truth in his remarks ‚Äî full or ""substantive"" honors are indeed reserved only for U.K. and Commonwealth citizens ‚Äî the reality is that, because of this, foreigners are only ever offered honorary awards in the first place. The prospect of Giuliani being offered a ""substantive"" knighthood, but only on condition that he obtain U.K. citizenship and/or relinquish his U.S. citizenship, simply would not have arisen.¬†"	false
1781	Snopes.com is an extremely liberal site with an agenda to discredit conservatives, paid for either by George Soros or the Clintons, or maybe Facebook.	"In February 2018, a years-old rumor about us spawned yet another low-effort, extremely inconsistent meme:We are unable to tell whether this meme was created initially as a joke or whether it was belched out from the bowels of a propaganda site, but it is hitting our sitemail with enough regularity that we decided to address it.The image shows two photographs side by side. To the left is an image of a man shaking hands with billionaire philanthropist George Soros; to the right is a man seated next to George Soros in what appears to be an office. The text of the meme reads as follows:BUSTED
SNOPES.COM
100% FAKE FACT-CHECKING SITEIn 2009 FactCheck.org exposed Snopes.com as an extremely liberal propaganda site with an agenda to discredit anything that appears to be conservative. Snopes has no employees and its owner has zero investigative research experience and facebook has hired him to fact check the news on FB. And Soros and the DNC have just been exposed as Snopes only client. What does that tell you!George Soros and the DNC
PROPAGANDA SITEWe would say that's quite a set of charges coming from the makers of this meme (whomever that might be) but it's so internally inconsistent as to fall apart with the barest scrutiny.For example: ""In 2009 FactCheck.org exposed Snopes.com as an extremely liberal propaganda site with an agenda to discredit anything that appears to be conservative.""FactCheck.org did write about us in 2009, in one of the only truthful statements that can be found in this meme. Here's what they actually said about our perceived political leanings:Do the Snopes.com articles reveal a political bias? We reviewed a sampling of their political offerings, including some on rumors about George W. Bush, Sarah Palin and Barack Obama, and we found them to be utterly poker-faced. David does say that the site receives more complaints that it is too liberal than that it is too conservative. Nevertheless, he says, ""We apply the same debunking standards to both sides.""Although our sites have somewhat different emphases ... Snopes.com does take on some claims in the political realm. That has given us an opportunity to evaluate the Mikkelson‚Äôs work from time to time. We have found it solid and well-documented. We even link to Snopes.com when it‚Äôs appropriate rather than reinvent the wheel ourselves, which we consider high praise.Nowhere could we find where FactCheck.org wrote that we are a liberal propaganda site with a stated agenda to discredit anything conservative, because it didn't. But you don't need to believe us -- you can read it here yourself.Moving on to the next part of the claim: ""Snopes has no employees and its owner has zero investigative research experience and facebook has hired him to fact check the news on FB. And Soros and the DNC have just been exposed as Snopes only client. What does that tell you!""What it tells us is that this meme makes no sense. Soros and the DNC are our only client? Are they the same entity? Even if you pretend that George Soros and the DNC are the same person or organization for a moment, the statement still falls apart when you consider that this claim also hinges on Facebook being a client as well.The Facebook part is the only other part of this meme that is somewhat true, although the rest ‚Äî as you may have guessed ‚Äî is not. We did at one time partner with Facebook, working alongside other organizations around the world to fact-check corrosive fake news and propaganda.A single glance at our staff page debunks the ""no employees"" lie. We are a team of highly experienced investigative journalists, as a quick search of our bylines would likely bring up. We have worked with local, national, and international news teams in a variety of media ‚Äî and we have the awards to show for it. We would also like to take a moment to point out, as well, that founder David Mikkelson has now been running Snopes.com for more than twenty years, making him less of a blushing upstart and more of someone who has not just dabbled in investigative reporting, but taken an active part in shaping fact-checking into what it is today.It is true that many of us do not have ""formal training"" in journalism, if you consider a degree to be formal training. We chose (as many journalists do) to learn our craft through painstaking experience and learned expertise instead, using our educations to deepen and broaden our specialties.Finally, those appear to be two different men shown purportedly meeting with George Soros. Neither is our chief executive officer and founder, David Mikkelson. He has dark hair, and there the resemblance to the photographs ends.¬†For the record, the man in the left-hand photograph is Hungarian entrepreneur and former prime minister Gordon Bajnai. We know this because a reverse image search indicates that the photograph was lifted directly from Wikimedia Commons. The man on the right, according to Maarten Schenk of LeadStories.com, is RocketBoom's Andrew Baron, once again using a photograph stolen from Wikimedia Commons without attribution and cropped and distorted slightly, which can confound reverse image searches.None of us works with or for any political campaign or party, nor have any of us so much as met George Soros and probably wouldn't recognize him if we did.So, then, why do we do this, if we're across the map politically and have no agenda, either tacit or open, to discredit any part of the political sphere? Is it simply because of our shared years of experience and absolute loathing of disinformation and propaganda? (It is.) If the creators of this meme were making it in good faith they would have asked us, the primary sources, to comment -- just as we would have done for them."	false
931	Republicans overturned a ban on smoking in the U.S. House of Representatives in January 2023.	"Under former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's leadership, the House did ban smoking in most areas of the Capitol in 2007. That ban's removal in 2023 did not change any policy regarding smoking in a House member's own office, as some press reports implied. There has never been a ban on smoking in a Representative's own office.In 2007, Former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi instituted a ban on smoking in the Capitol, announcing that ""the days of smoke-filled rooms in the United States Capitol are over."" That ban, in essence, brought the Capitol in line with public smoking bans instituted around the country at the time. As The New York Times explained in 2007, this ban did not affect smoking in a Representative's office, but did affect a classically smoke-filled room known as the Speaker's Lobby.¬†Lawmakers can still smoke in their individual offices, but they can no longer light up in the ornate hallway outside the House chamber known as the Speaker's Lobby, the spot where lawmakers often gather to talk with each other and with journalists. Most other areas of the Capitol, including the public areas outside the Senate, had already banned smoking.At the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, the Republican-controlled House reversed this ban, allowing smoking in public portions of the capitol excluding the House floor.¬†Reports of increased tobacco smoke at the start of the 118th Congress appear to stem, at least in part, from the fact that Rep. Tom Cole ‚Äî an avid cigar smoker ‚Äî had moved into an office near the house press gallery. For example, Reuters reporter Patricia Zengerle tweeted that ""there's indoor smoking on the House side of the Capitol now that the Republicans have taken control.""¬†Another Reuters reporter suggested that the new odors were cigars because Rep. Cole ""evidently loves cigars.""Following these observations, several news outlets suggested the practice of politicians like Cole smoking in their office was a result of that policy change. However, there has never been a ban on smoking in a House member's own office, even under the Pelosi ban. While it is factual that a smoking ban instituted by Pelosi was overturned, that reversal did not affect the presence of office smoking.Because, however, a ban instituted by House Democrats in 2007 was overturned by House Republicans in 2023, the claim is ""True."""	true

And as you see it was going to hit not only Florida but Georgia and sort of was going toward the Gulf, that was what we ‚Äî what was originally projected, and it took a right turn.""We sent questions to the White House asking why the black mark was drawn onto the map that was displayed during the briefing , and why President Trump displayed that particular map (which was outdated by almost a week) instead of a current one. We have not yet received answers to our questions.Some critics accused the White House of altering an official weather graphic to retroactively justify an earlier tweet by Trump that stated Alabama would be among the states ""hit (much) harder than anticipated"" by Dorian. Trump's Sept. 1 tweet forced the National Weather Service to correct the record and clarify that Alabama would not be affected by the powerful hurricane:Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.

5719	Nike offered 'people of color' several coupons for discounts on the company's products.	"Nike's September 2018 advertising deal with Colin Kaepernick caused a storm of controversy and debate in September 2018, with calls for a boycott of the company by those opposed to the national anthem protests against racial injustice which Kaepernick led by ""taking a knee"" during the 2016 NFL season.The deal also prompted a wave of misinformation and junk news, include fake reports that the University of Alabama, the federal government, and Michael Jordan had all cut ties with Nike over the Kaepernick deal, that Kaepernick had immediately lost the deal after an ""anti-white"" rant, and a viral hoax which falsely claimed that one man had ended up in the hospital after symbolically setting fire to his Nike shoes, while still wearing them.In the days following the announcement of the endorsement deal, internet users began sharing fake Nike coupons which purported to offer 'people of color' significant discounts on Nike shoes and clothing, as part of the ongoing ""believe in something"" campaign being headed by Kaepernick.In an archived 5 September thread on the controversial /pol (""politically incorrect"") section of 4Chan, users posted three versions of the fake coupons -- one offering 'people of color' 75 percent off shoes and apparel until 1 January 2019, another offering the same discount until 9 September 2018, and another offering ""urban youth"" 80 percent off shoes and apparel until 31 October 2018:¬†¬†¬†In a conversation riddled with racist tropes, slurs and imagery, 4Chan users discussed plans to print out the fake coupons and distribute them in shopping malls and near Nike stores in an effort to cause confusion and mischief.In a potentially dangerous twist, the QR code on the second coupon reveals a threatening message when scanned with a QR reader: ""This is a ROBBERY, Move slowly and put all the LARGE bills in the shoe box OR everyone DIES.""In reality, Nike did not offer any such discount coupons in September 2018, as none was listed among the company's official list of promotions and discounts. A small image of Kaepernick's face in the QR code of two of the coupons further confirmed that the artifacts were hoaxes."	false

1756	Voice analysis of Buzz Aldrin and other former astronauts revealed the existence of extraterrestrials.	"On 8 April 2018, an English tabloid attempted to pass off a long-debunked conspiracy theory about astronaut Buzz Aldrin and three of his peers as an ""exclusive"" by involving a questionable research group.According to the London-based Daily Star, Aldrin ‚Äî as well as Gordon Cooper, Edgar Mitchell, and Al Worden¬†‚Äî ""took part"" in a study by the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology in the United States. The fact that Cooper and Mitchell are both dead is not mentioned until the story's penultimate paragraph.Despite stating in its headline that Aldrin (who piloted the Apollo 11 mission in 1969)¬† passed a ""lie detector test,"" the Star reported that the four astronauts' ""participation"" consisted of an alleged analysis of recordings of the two men's voices. But there is no mention of which recordings were covered by the ""complex computer analyses"" of their voice patterns; instead, the Star reported that ""these studies are claimed to be more reliable than current lie detector tests and could soon replace those used by the FBI and police,"" without stating exactly who is making said claim:Aldrin has always maintained he spotted a UFO on the way to the moon, saying: ""There was something out there that was close enough to be observed, sort of L-shaped.""The tabloid also reported that Sharry Edwards, who heads the Ohio-based institute, said that even though Aldwin ""cannot explain it,"" he is somehow sure that he saw a non-terrestrial spacecraft. But the tabloid did not mention that Aldrin himself¬†said during a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" chat session on 8 July 2014 that what he saw was likely not anything extraterrestrial:There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world - it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And i feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don't know. So technically, the definition could be ""unidentified.""We reached out to Aldrin seeking comment but did not hear back prior to publication; a spokesperson for him told the Australian web site Pedestrian, ""This is bogus and we don't know where it came from.""Aldrin's spokesperson also emailed us to rebut the allegation, saying:Buzz did not take a lie detector test. He has never said he saw a UFO. This story has been a fabrication for the sake of headlines and is not true as far as Buzz Aldrin is concerned. We think they've twisted one of his interviews to mean something it does not. Buzz has always been very clear that he never saw any UFO's or anything to indicate we've been contacted by alien life.

"California's 2018 U.S. Senate election attracted nationwide attention in April 2018, not long after the publication of a poll showing that little-known Republican and committed neo-Nazi Patrick Little had 18 percent of support among likely primary election voters, second to incumbent Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein with 39 percent.In the SurveyUSA poll, Little¬†‚Äî who describes himself as a ""white nationalist"" ‚Äî had greater support than four other candidates in the state's open primary, which candidates of any party (or none) can enter. These included outgoing California Senate President Kevin de L√©on, a Democrat, and businessman Rocky de la Fuente, a Republican.¬†If those poll numbers were to hold, Feinstein and Little would advance from the primary as the two top candidates and contest the general election in November. The Republican party would be represented in a national race by a candidate who advocates a future United States ""free from Jews"" and has repeatedly and unreservedly expressed anti-semitic and white nationalist views during his campaign.¬†On 28 April 2018, Newsweek reported on the California primary and included a quote from one of Little's social media profiles in which he advocated removing and barring Jewish people from the United States.We received several enquiries from readers about the authenticity of these statements.¬†They are authentic quotations. On his account with the social network Gab, Little made the following statement:I propose a government that makes counter-semitism central to all aims of the state. A government:1) Of a People, for that people, free from jews2) That cannot revoke the right to bear arms, such that this people can remain free from jews3) that forbids all immigration except of biological kin, where no person of jewish origin may live, vacation, or traverseHe has also espoused anti-semitic conspiracy theories, called for racial segregation (white people migrating to all-white ""continuity zones"" in the United States), and even appeared to threaten the extermination of Jewish people who refuse to voluntarily vacate their government employment.¬†In an e-mail response to our enquiries, California Republican Party spokesperson Matt Fleming told us:Mr. Little has never been an active member of our party. I do not know Mr. Little and I am not familiar with his positions. But in the strongest terms possible, we condemn anti-semitism and any other form of religious bigotry, just as we do with racism, sexism or anything else that can be construed as a hateful point of view.¬†Little is the third Republican candidate for national office during the 2018 electoral cycle to have expressed openly anti-semitic and racist views.¬†In March, former American Nazi Party leader Arthur Jones ran unopposed in the GOP primary for Illinois' Third U.S. Congressional District, and will represent the party in November's general election.¬†In Wisconsin's First U.S. Congressional District, one of the Republicans seeking to replace retiring House leader Paul Ryan in November is Paul Nehlen, who has described himself as ""pro-white"" and frequently expresses virulently anti-semitic sentiments on social media."	true
1910	The restaurant review website Zomato suffered an attack that compromised 17 million users' data	"  The India-based restaurant review web site Zomato revealed on 18 May 2017 that it had been the victim of a cyber attack compromising data for millions of users.Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal and chief technology officer, Gunjan Patidar, detailed the nature of the attack in a blog post on 23 May 2017:
The data downloaded as a result of this breach contained five data points for 17 million users - names, emails, numeric user IDs, usernames, and password hashes. The password hashes leak was a little more contained and impacted a subset of 6.6 million users - all the other users were using Facebook/Google for login - we don‚Äôt have any password information for those accounts.Five days earlier, Patidar said in another post that users' credit card and payment information had not been affected by the data breach.The party responsible for the attack said in an interview that they reported a ""vulnerability in the company's infrastructure"" to Zomato after discovering it in 2016 but did not get the response, saying, ""It does not justify the pain I caused to them, but it is a reason.""The hacker also reportedly posted the data for sale on a ""dark web"" site, alongside a sample of around 50 accounts. The tech blog Motherboard confirmed that the data was likely legitimately connected to Zomato users, since it could not create new accounts on the site using the email addresses listed on the sample.According to Goyal and Patidar, the hacker grabbed information belonging to a developer that was leaked online as a result of a separate breach against the Lithuanian company 000WebHost in October 2015.But Patidar later described the hacker as ""very cooperative"":He/she wanted us to acknowledge security vulnerabilities in our system and work with the ethical hacker community to plug the gaps.

3171	A 2021 study found astronaut Scott Kelly's heart shrank by 27% over the course of roughly one year in space.	"In spring 2021, news headlines claimed that American astronaut Scott Kelly's heart shrank in mass by more than one-quarter when he spent about one year on the International Space Station in 2015 and 2016.The news stories were purportedly based on a study published in the journal Circulation, a research arm of the American Heart Association (AHA) that publishes peer-reviewed research about cardiovascular health and diseases.Using the journal's website, we determined the research to be authentic. We obtained a copy of the study's summary, titled ""Cardiac Effects of Repeated Weightlessness During Extreme During Swimming Compared With Spaceflight,"" which was published on March 29, 2021, and explained the key findings of the research project attempting to determine the effect of Earth's gravitational pull on the human cardiovascular system.Led by Dr. Benjamin Levine, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas, the researchers analyzed the left ventricle (LV) of two people's hearts: Kelly's and that of Beno√Æt Lecomte, a long-distance endurance swimmer who attempted to cross the Pacific Ocean in 2018. (Note: The left ventricle is the biggest and strongest of four heart chambers, pumping oxygenized blood throughout the body.)The experiment looked at Kelly's heart before, during, and after his space trip -- he exercised almost every day in space to avoid losing muscle mass -- as well as studied Lecomte's cardiovascular system over the course of his 159-day swim. The researchers concluded:""LV mass declined at similar rates in both individuals. B.L.‚Äôs mass dropped by 0.72 g/wk (95% CI, ‚àí0.14 to 1.58) and S.K.‚Äôs mass dropped by 0.74 g/wk (95% CI, 0.13‚Äì1.34) when linear regression is applied.""¬†In other words, despite both men's physical activity, their hearts shrank at rate of about 1/40th of an ounce each week (0.72 g/wk for Lecomte and 0.74 g/wk for Kelly).For the swimmer, that meant his left ventricle lightened from an estimated six ounces to five ounces over the course of his long swim.¬†‚ÄúI was just shocked,‚Äù Levine told The New York Times of that finding. ‚ÄúI really thought that his heart was going to get bigger. This was a lot of exercise that he‚Äôs doing.‚ÄùAs for the astronaut, his heart size similarly decreased, showing a 27% decline in mass overall, as shown via the study's graph documenting the sizes of the two men's left ventricle over time (displayed below). Kelly's left ventricle went from 6.7 ounces to 4.9 ounces after the space trip, according to the experiment.‚ÄúHis heart adapted to the reduced gravity,‚Äù Levine told The New York Times. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt become dysfunctional, the excess capacity didn‚Äôt get reduced to a critical level. He remained reasonably fit. His heart shrank and atrophied kind of as you‚Äôd expect from going into space.‚Äù"	true
90	An airliner was saved by a pickup truck after its landing gear malfunctioned.	"Rumors began to tout the supposedly incredible abilities of the Nissan Frontier after the advertising agency TBWA Worldwide produced a commercial in 2011 showing the pickup truck saving a plane after the latter's landing gear malfunctioned:The advertisement was presented like a breaking news story, including witness reports, shaky handheld footage, and an interview with the driver (an airport mechanic) who insisted he ""was not a hero."" The video also included the words ""Fictionalization. Do not attempt"" written in small letters at the bottom of the screen, but many viewers missed and were left believing they had watched a real news segment:https://youtu.be/zdFd9AVlIOQ
¬†
Although many viewers believed the commercial depicted a real event, a 2013 Jalopnik article posited the feat shown in the advertisement was extremely implausible, if not outright impossible:You'd be dropping 5,000+ lbs onto the back of a Nissan Frontier that's only rated for at most 1,500 lbs (assuming you're driving the manual V6) and that's going 100+ MPH. That weight won't hit all at once ‚Äî it'll slowly grow heavier and heavier as the pilot pitches the nose down. Pretty soon you'll break the tires, rims, suspension and more.The landing gear failure ad was just one of the deceptive television spots created by Nissan and TBWA Worldwide in 2011. One of their ads, entitled ""Hill Climb,"" was so misleading it raised the ire of the Federal Trade Commission, who said in a press release:Nissan and TBWA promoted the Frontier pickup truck with a ""Hill Climb"" advertisement that showed the vehicle rescuing a dune buggy trapped in sand on a steep hill, while onlookers observe the feat in amazement. It was produced in a realistic ""YouTube"" style, as if it were shot on a mobile phone video camera.Administrative complaints allege that Nissan and TBWA violated the FTC Act by representing that the ad accurately showed the performance of an unaltered Nissan Frontier under the conditions that were depicted. In fact, the truck is not capable of pushing the dune buggy up and over the hill, and both the truck and the dune buggy were dragged to the top of the hill by cables, according to the complaints. The complaints also allege that the hill was made to look significantly steeper than it actually was.""Special effects in ads can be entertaining, but advertisers can't use them to misrepresent what a product can do,"" said Jessica Rich, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. ""This ad made the Nissan Frontier appear capable of doing something it can't do.""Nissan issued a statement asserting they had not purposefully deceived customers, saying: ""Nissan takes its commitment to fair and truthful advertising seriously. The company has been and remains committed to complying with the law.""The company seemed to be making an attempt to be more honest with its customers afterwards, as an even more implausible 2014 commercial for the Nissan Rogue featured several disclaimers, including ""Fantasy, do not attempt"" and ""Cars can't jump on trains"":"	false
1924	The lion used for the original MGM logo killed its trainer and his assistants.	"The roaring lion appearing at the beginning of films produced by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio and in the company's logo is one of the world's most widely recognized mascots. According to a history of that logo, the choice of a lion as a mascot preceded the 1924 merger of Metro Pictures Corporation, Goldwyn Pictures, and Louis B. Mayer Pictures that created the MGM motion picture studio:The logo was first designed for Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, in 1916. Howard Deitz, a Publicity Executive, chose to use a lion as the studio‚Äôs mascot, paying tribute to his alma mater, Columbia University. The inspiration was the school's fight song ""Roar, Lion, Roar."" Mr. Deitz is also credited for writing our motto ""Ars Gratia Artis,"" Latin meaning ""Art for Art's Sake."" ""Slats"" was the first lion used on Goldwyn Pictures logo from 1917 until 1924, first appearing on the 1917 release ""Polly of the Circus."" After the 1924 merger that created MGM, ""Slats"" was retained and continued to appear on our logo until 1928. He appeared on MGM's first release ""He Who Gets Slapped,"" starring Lon Chaney, in 1924.As chronicled at The Silver Screen Affair blog, a number of different lions have been used for the MGM logo over the years, the most well known being Leo, who is MGM's longest-lived lion and has been appearing on MGM films since 1957.The MGM lion is prominent enough to have featured in urban legends, one of which we first encountered in 2004:Lately, I've heard a neat Urban Legend about the MGM Lion's roar.It goes that the lion was originally meant to be standing proud and silent, but roared when two burglars rushed into the warehouse.The burglars in question were Boris Regina and Karl Maninovsky.Supposedly, Regina and Maninovsky would regularly rob banks and stash their loot at a warehouse a few blocks away.One day, while the burglars' warehouse was normally empty, MGM and their lion were recording there. The lion roared at Regina and Maninovsky as they entered, after which MGM stopped recording.The lion then jumped off the platform and mauled Maninovsky, who died two days later. Regina ran out of the warehouse and got run over by a police car heading to the bank he had just robbed.This tale was nothing more than an amusing fabrication, one of a number of invented urban legends presented in video form on the JK Cinema web site.A similar claim about the original MGM lion's having ""killed its trainer and two assistants"" the day after he was filmed for the first MGM logo was promulgated by Factropolis.com, one of a number of sites whose raison d'√™tre was passing off fictional factoids as real information. This claim is clearly not true, as the trainer of Slats, the lion first used by Goldwyn Pictures in 1917 (and subsequently by MGM) was Volney Phifer, a prominent animal trainer who long outlived Slats and passed away in retirement in the 1970s:""Slats"" was trained to roar on cue by Volney Phifer, Hollywood's premier animal trainer, and toured the world to signify MGM's launch. He was born at the Dublin Zoo and died in 1936. By that time Mr. Phifer had retired to his farm in Gillette, New Jersey, where he boarded animals used on Broadway. Upon ""Slats""' death he was buried on the farm, where a small blank block of granite marked the grave. Additionally, Mr. Phifer planted a pine tree directly over the grave, insisting that its roots would ""hold down the lion's spirit,"" which is a part of a secret of European wisdom.Simply put, none of the several lions filmed by MGM for use in their logos was involved in incidents that killed their trainers. All of those animals were handled by professional trainers who were well known in show business circles and whose deaths in any lion-mauling attacks would have been prominent news."	false
3973	The U.S. Department of Homeland Security orchestrated a sting against Democrats by adding a secret watermark to prove their participation in election fraud.	"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In the uncertain days following the 2020 U.S. presidential election, a fantasy pushed by QAnon personalities and die-hard supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump went viral. In broad brushstrokes, the idea was that Democrats would soon be exposed in a massive voter-fraud sting operation orchestrated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The basic premise is that Democrats, in an effort to steal the election in favor of their party's nominee, Joe Biden, printed extra ballots. But, the claim goes, Trump's DHS anticipated this and added a secret watermark to the ballots, making it easy to identify the fraudulent ballots.""The DEMS fell right into the trap of this sting operation and President Trump has it all,"" a viral bit of Facebook copypasta asserted. ""Fraud will be exposed for the world to see.""As with most conspiracy theories, there are myriad variations on this broad claim, each with its own purported evidence. These variations, both tedious and irrelevant, generally concern the type of watermark used, and the presence or absence of some sort of blockchain-based security. Going into each of these different claims is unnecessary, as all versions of the claim hold that the ruse was possible because the federal government controls the production of ballots. This is, emphatically, not the case.In fact, this is left up to the states, each of which has its own regulations to follow. Practically speaking, most elections are administered at the county level, where they are run either by a board of electors, an election official or officials, or both. This means there are, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than more than 10,000 unique election administration jurisdictions in the U.S., each of which with their own balloting procedures. The large conspiracy alleged here would necessarily involve infiltrating thousands of different election boards or jurisdictions.The federal government is not responsible for printing or auditing the ballots, either. In most cases, private companies contracted by those local election boards to do the printing. DHS has explicitly stated this in response to these rumors:While DHS and CISA assist states and localities with securing election infrastructure, DHS and CISA [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency] do not design, print, or audit ballots. State and local election officials manage ballot design and printing, as well as the auditing of results.Local election offices have security and detection measures in place that make it highly difficult to commit fraud through counterfeit ballots. While the specific measures vary, in accordance with state and local election laws and practices, ballot security measures can include signature matching, information checks, barcodes, watermarks, and precise paper weights."	false

But we noticed that the fictional article used photographs from at least two real news stories.One of those real news stories was published by realestate.com.au in 2018. Anthony Doolin discovered several abandoned mines after he bought a $1.35 million property in Brisbane, Australia:A Brisbane man got the shock of his life after discovering a gold mine in his suburban backyard.It was certainly not in the fine print that he was sitting on a gold mine when he took over the property located just 20km from the Brisbane CBD, according to Anthony Doolin.He was out exploring his 16.5 hectares of land when he literally stumbled upon the mine shaft.Mr. Doolin had 16.1 hectares to explore.‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt told about it, we just found it there one day,‚Äù Mr Doolin said.‚ÄúI nearly fell over, I just pictured Indiana Jones and underground railroads.‚ÄùUnfortunately, Doolin never explored the mines. He and his mother sold the property. In March 2020, the MEAWW blog reported: ""Doolin had published an asking price of $1.65 million, but no one met that number. Eventually, he settled for the same amount he had initially paid for the property."" There was no indication that he entered the ""lost"" cave and dropped to his knees after making some dramatic discovery, as falsely suggested by the online advertisements.As for the ""monster"" that ended the viral Interesticle story, those photographs were taken from an October 2015 History article that documented a Michigan farmer who dug up woolly mammoth bones:Last Monday, farmer James Bristle and his neighbor were digging a trench to install a drainage pipe in his wheat field on the outskirts of Chelsea, Michigan, when their backhoe suddenly struck something hard about eight feet underground. At first, the pair thought they had hit a buried piece of wood, perhaps a fence post, but they soon realized they had uncovered something neither had ever seen before‚Äîan enormous three-foot-long bone.‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know what it was, but we knew it was certainly a lot bigger than a cow bone,‚Äù Bristle said. Believing the strange object may have been a dinosaur bone, the farmer contacted the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology, located just 10 miles away from his field.Daniel Fisher, a professor and director of the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology, arrived at Bristle‚Äôs farm last Thursday with a team of 15 students to investigate the relic. With time of the essence because of a tight harvest schedule, Bristle gave the team of paleontologists only one day to complete their work before he needed to resume his drainage project. So at dawn‚Äôs early light, Fisher‚Äôs team‚Äîwith the help of two local excavators‚Äîbegan to dig a 10-foot-deep excavation pit. Working briskly, the paleontologist soon discovered that Bristle‚Äôs farm contained the remains of a prehistoric mammoth.The ""man finds weird cave"" or ""man finds lost cave"" story about the gold mine bore some similarities to previous headlines that circulated in 2016, when it appeared to some readers that a new ""Star Wars"" movie would be filmed ""soon"" in their towns. Unfortunately, this was also untrue."	false
3178	"A photograph shows an official ""Strange Things"" inspired jersey for the WNBA team Indiana Fever."	"On April 8, 2021, a photograph started circulating on social media that supposedly showed a new jersey for the WNBA team Indiana Fever that had been inspired by the sci-fi show ""Stranger Things.""This is an official WNBA jersey for the Indiana Fever and the design truly pays homage to the hit sci-fi show ""Stranger Things.""¬†The WNBA unveiled new jerseys for all 12 teams in the league ahead of their 25th season. ESPN reported these new jerseys have ""city-specific flourishes"" to make them unique for each team:Glass ceilings and the Space Needle, the 19th Amendment and ""Equality."" As part of the WNBA's 25th anniversary season in 2021, players will wear new Nike jerseys with individual messages and city-specific flourishes for each of the 12 teams.On Thursday, Nike unveiled the collection, which adds a highly anticipated third jersey option (Rebel Edition) to the teams' Heroine Edition (home) and Explorer Edition (away) uniforms.All of the jerseys have a 1/144 notation to represent the number of players in the WNBA. Front numbers have returned. And for the first time since 2015, white jerseys will be back in the WNBA. Previous uniforms had followed a template with only different colorways and sponsorships to distinguish them. The 2021 uniforms will include unique fonts, patterns (hello, pinstripes!) and symbols.The Fever wrote on their website that two of their jerseys (the heroine and explorer editions) took inspiration from the ""Lady Victory"" statue atop the Soldiers & Sailors monument in Indianapolis, while the ""Rebel Edition"" jersey was inspired by ""Stranger Things,"" a sci-fi show that takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.¬†The Fever wrote: ""A rebel is unapologetic and irreverent. Someone who rises in opposition and isn't afraid to take on a challenge. Inspired by Netflix's Stranger Things (a series set in Hawkins, Indiana) the rebel takes the upside down and pits it onto a jersey. The darker tone and jersey details embody the power of a mage ready for combat.""In a video unveiling the jersey, the Fever's Teaira McCowan can be seen entering Bankers Life Fieldhouse to face off against a ""Demogorgon"" as the ""Strange Things"" theme music plays in the background:"	true
6089	A local identification card program in Chicago would allow undocumented immigrants to vote in United States elections.	Chicago officials are preparing to launch a new identification card program that streamlines library and transit access, leading local officials to reject allegations that it will lead to illegal voting by non-U.S. citizens and undocumented immigrants.For example, Alderman Gilbert Villegas ‚Äî who heads the city council's Latino Caucus¬†‚Äî responded to criticism of the CityKey program by rejecting the conflation of undocumented status with being of Latino descent:Given all the rhetoric that's occurring in Washington D.C., this is just an opportunity for some communities to challenge the Latino community. So we've got to stand up and defend it.CityKey cards are optional. A spokesperson for the City Clerk, Kate LeFurgy, told us that the cards are intended to benefit underserved communities like homeless and transgender residents and domestic violence survivors, as well as undocumented immigrants. The cards can also be used for library and transit services.However, she said, the new cards do not automatically confer voting eligibility:We would never want to put anyone at risk. The idea that there's all these people out there committing voter fraud, there's no data to suggest that.Several other cities, including San Francisco, Milwaukee, and New York City, have implemented their own local programs. Neil Albrecht, chairman of the City of Milwaukee Election Commission, confirmed to us that their local card is not accepted for use as voter identification.A spokesperson for the San Francisco Board of Elections told us that it had not faced any issues with illegal voting since its City ID Card program was launched in 2009, despite those cards being accepted as proof of voter identification. But in Chicago, some aldermen voiced concern after receiving a memo from Valencia stating that the cards would also be accepted as valid for voting identification purposes. Anthony Napolitano, who represents the city's 41st ward, said:This was portrayed to us as a way for people to get basic services. This is exactly what we were concerned about and we raised those concerns with the clerk. I know I have colleagues who would not be on board with this.However, Jim Allen, communications director for the Chicago Board of Elections, told us that CityKey changes nothing about existing electoral law:You can be a non-citizen and have a driver's license; a driver's license is considered acceptable [voter] ID. You can be a non-citizen and have electrical service and a ConEd bill, a phone bill, a utility bill. [CityKey] is being portrayed as this new thing, this new threat that non-citizens are suddenly going to be encouraged to register to vote. That's not the case.Matt Dietrich, a spokesperson for the Illinois State Board of Elections, said the penalty for an illegal vote already serves as a deterrent:The main thing that would happen is deportation. If you're not a citizen, and you have any thoughts of ever attaining citizenship, registering to vote is almost an instant trigger that when you apply for citizenship, you will be deported. That's one of the first things they check.Several debunked and unsupported claims of widespread voter fraud that have made the rounds on a regular basis for several years appear to be informing the Chicago debate over identification cards. In any case, Villegas told us, those concerns are overblown:In the city of Chicago in the last mayoral election, less than 50 percent of registered voters voted. You're talking about U.S. citizens and people who are eligible to vote¬†‚Äî less than 50 percent of the voting population partook in the election. Now all of a sudden they're concerned that undocumented folks are gonna go register to vote? They have that ability now to do that.	false
3051	A planned update for Google Maps will change the app to no longer show the fastest routes by default.	"An update planned for later in 2021 will change the Google Maps app to ""default to the route with the lowest carbon footprint when it has approximately the same ETA as the fastest route."" However, users will be able to opt out of the new feature if they choose.On April 21, 2021, a headline from phonearena.com appeared in Google Discover feeds that claimed: ""After update, Google Maps will no longer give you the fastest route by default."" Google Discover is a free product from the tech giant that delivers a personalized feed of news stories and blog articles.That story referenced the website autoevolution, which reported that ""sometime later this year, Google will push out an update for Maps that will no longer show users by default the quickest way between two points."" Instead, the goal will be fuel efficiency.It is true that Google is planning an update for Google Maps that will show the most fuel-efficient route by default, rather than the fastest.Although the new feature may be all about creating a more eco-friendly world, it will still be optional. After the update, Google Maps users can opt out and continue receiving the fastest route in search results if they choose.On March 30, Google published the news on its blog. A key part of the blog post appeared to be that recommended fuel-efficient routes will have ""approximately the same ETA"" as the quickest route possible. In other words, according to the company, users should not expect a dramatic change in their time of arrival:Soon, Google Maps will default to the route with the lowest carbon footprint when it has approximately the same ETA as the fastest route. In cases where the eco-friendly route could significantly increase your ETA, we‚Äôll let you compare the relative CO2 impact between routes so you can choose.Always want the fastest route? That‚Äôs OK too ‚Äî simply adjust your preferences in Settings. Eco-friendly routes launch in the U.S. on Android and iOS later this year, with a global expansion on the way.On March 31, BBC reported that the new Google Maps feature was all about the company's ""commitment to fight climate change"":When alternative routes are significantly faster, Google will offer choices and let users compare estimated emissions.""What we are seeing is for around half of routes, we are able to find an option more eco-friendly with minimal or no time-cost trade-off,"" Russell Dicker, a director of product at Google said.The search engine, owned by Alphabet, said it uses emissions data based on testing across different types of cars and road types, drawing on insights from the US government's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL).Its road data factors in slopes and inclines from its own Street View cars feature along with aerial and satellite imagery."	true
2740	Attendees were prohibited from bringing toasters to Trump rallies.	"On Aug. 22, 2021, as former U.S. President Donald Trump held a rally in Alabama, a photograph started circulating on social media that supposedly showed a list of prohibited items:This is a genuine list of items prohibited from Trump rallies.¬†The majority of the items come from a list of prohibited objects maintained by the U.S. Secret Service. While the majority of the items listed above were culled from that Secret Service list, the above-displayed list also prohibits several additional items, such as alcohol, tripods, and appliances or toasters.¬†The above-displayed list appears to be relatively standard for Trump rallies. We found guidelines for several of Trump's previous rallies that also prohibited these items. Before a rally at Eerie National Airport in October 2020, for example, the local news outlet YourErie.com reported that the following items were prohibited at the event:Prohibited Items List
‚Ä¢ Aerosols
‚Ä¢ Alcoholic beverages
‚Ä¢ Backpacks, bags, roller bags, suitcases bags exceeding size restrictions (12‚Äùx14‚Äùx5‚Äù)
‚Ä¢ Balloons
‚Ä¢ Balls
‚Ä¢ Banners, signs, placards
‚Ä¢ Chairs
‚Ä¢ Coolers
‚Ä¢ Drones and other unmanned aircraft systems
‚Ä¢ Explosives of any kind (including fireworks)
‚Ä¢ Glass, thermal and metal containers
‚Ä¢ Laser lights and laser pointers
‚Ä¢ E-Cigarrettes and Vaping Devices
‚Ä¢ Mace and/or pepper spray

‚Ä¢ Packages
‚Ä¢ Poles, sticks and selfie sticks
‚Ä¢ Spray containers
‚Ä¢ Structures
‚Ä¢ Supports for signs/placards
‚Ä¢ Tripods
‚Ä¢ Umbrellas
‚Ä¢ Appliances (i.e. Toasters)
‚Ä¢ And any other items that may pose a threat to the security of the event as determined by and at the discretion of the security screeners.The Sheriff's Department in Cullman County, where the August 2021 Trump rally was held, told us that the prohibited items list was put together by the Secret Service and the event organizers. As the Secret Service's list of prohibited items does not include appliances, it seems reasonable that this item was added by the Trump team.It should be noted, however, that while the idea that ""Trump bans toasters"" may sound funny, there could be a good reason for prohibiting appliances. One possible reason is that some appliances, such as pressure cookers, have been used to make homemade bombs. We reached out to the Secret Service, Trump's Save America Pac, and rally host York Family Farms for more information, and we will update this article accordingly if we hear back.¬†"	true
2242	"An old episode of ""The Simpsons"" predicted the 2022 ""freedom convoy"" trucker protest in Canada."	"Curious about how Snopes' writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption? We've collected some posts that help explain how we do what we do. Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing.In January 2022, as a convoy of trucks drove across Canada in protest of the country's COVID-19 requirements, a video started to circulate online that supposedly showed an old clip from ""The Simpsons"" television series predicting these current events:But this video edits together two different episodes of ""The Simpsons"" to make it seem like the show was predicting the protest in Canada when it actually wasn't. Furthermore, the audio in the clip showing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was altered, and does not feature the audio from the original episode of ""The Simpsons.""The first clip of Homer and Bart driving a truck comes from ""Maximum Homerdrive,"" the 17th episode of the animated show's 10th season. In the original episode, the truck convoy is not part of any protest. Rather, the truckers are upset with Homer because he revealed the trucker's ""auto-drive"" secret:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hxGDYn7AHM

The clip of Trudeau comes from ""D'oh Canada,"" the 21st episode of the show's 30th season. In the original clip, Trudeau doesn't run away from truckers while screaming ""oh no!"" Rather, he meets Lisa via a video call and attempts to impress her with various feats of strength. Trudeau goes out the window and climbs down the building after Lisa asks him about the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Here's the original clip:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TTTNb9-z3s

3683	An article on people-today.com recounted a true story about a mother reuniting with her adult son after he went missing nearly 40 years before.	"In December 2020, Snopes became aware of a web page on people-today.com ‚Äî a website that brands itself as a hub of self-help advice ‚Äî with the headline: ""40 years After Her Son Vanished, Somebody Tips Police To Look In A Very Unexpected Place.""With black-and-white photos (including the one-displayed below) and other images, the page told a story about a woman named ""Marry"" who supposedly fell in love with a man named ""Peter"" and gave birth to their son ""Joshua.""When Joshua was a toddler, the page alleged, Marry got pregnant again ‚Äî this time with twins. But Peter apparently had an adverse reaction to his expanding family. The page read:If Marry decided to keep the children he would leave her. [...] There was no way she was giving up the twins. If Peter wanted to walk out on them, that was on him. It took only a few weeks to get everything in order and then Peter left them. For good. He moved to a different city and left Marry in the dark about which one this was.After that ultimatum from Peter ‚Äî it was him or the twins ‚Äî Marry apparently moved in with her parents and gave birth for the second time.An unspecified amount of time passed after that. Then, a few days after Joshua's 4th birthday, the plot alluded to in the article's headline took shape: Joshua suddenly disappeared while Marry was working. ""Nobody seems to have seen him or noticed anything,"" the page read.Next, the author described an exhaustive and unsuccessful search for Joshua by Marry and law enforcement, as well as Marry's grief.Fast forward decades, after the twins grew up and Marry supposedly entered retirement, and a police officer called the mother. The page said:""Peter supposedly admitted that it was him who had taken Joshua all those years ago. [...] With this information, there was not even enough time in Marry‚Äôs mind to be as mad at Peter as she should have been. There was only one thing she could think of, and that was getting in contact with Joshua.""The story concluded with Marry traveling more than 20 hours to an unknown destination where a grown-up Joshua apparently lived with his family, including a 12-year-old son, Marry's grandson.¬†But the entire tale of Marry, Peter, and Joshua was fictional, and the photos on the web page did not show different stages of their lives.

3084	A Boeing B-17E bomber from World War II was found in the jungle with coffee still in thermoses.	"Since at least early 2021, an online advertisement displayed the following words: ""Man Finds Plane Hidden in Jungle, But When He Looks Inside."" we also found two variations that read ""Experts Can't Believe Contents Inside WWII Plane"" and ""Decades Later Plane Found, But They Looked Inside."" The ad was displayed on the Taboola advertising network. The incomplete text hinted that something interesting had been found inside a World War II airplane that later became known as ""Swamp Ghost."" An intriguing ad actually led to some truth for once.Readers who clicked the ad were led to a slideshow article on a website named Skip and Giggle. The story told of a Boeing B-17E bomber from World War II that had been discovered in Papau New Guinea in 1972.In 2010, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that the ""Swamp Ghost,"" a U.S. military plane, went down on Feb. 23, 1942, after being ""damaged by enemy fire"" and subsequently losing fuel. The incident happened ""during a raid on Japanese forces at Rabaul in New Britain.""The four-engine B-17E Flying Fortress was built by Boeing in November 1941, flew from California to Hawaii days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and then island-hopped to Australia....Army Air Corps Capt. Fred Eaton piloted the aircraft to a belly landing in what turned out to be a swamp and the nine crewmen survived a six-week ordeal escaping the swamp and making their way to safety.‚ÄúOften in my life the courage and the perseverance that Dad and his fellow crew members demonstrated gave me courage to face some of the challenges we‚Äôve all met in life,‚Äù said the bombardier‚Äôs son, Mike Oliver of Richmond, Va., who was born while his father was missing in action.An Australian air force crew came upon the B-17 in 1972.The aircraft had a wingspan of nearly 104 feet (32 meters) and a length of nearly 74 feet (23 meters).The Union-Tribune also noted that World War II B-17 pilot David Tallichet ""started efforts to recover the plane in the 1980s, but didn‚Äôt live to see its return."" Tallichet, who died in 2007, was the focus of the lengthy slideshow article that resulted from clicking the ad.As of early 2021, the most recent satellite imagery of ""Swamp Ghost's"" resting place available on Google Maps was from 2002.

In 2010, the forward fuselage was displayed in a ceremony in Long Beach, California.In 2013, the aircraft arrived at the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum in Oahu, Hawaii.As of 2019, it was still ""undergoing restoration.""https://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasrivettephotography/46117199385/On Sept. 11, 2020, the museum published a webinar on the history of the aircraft.Prior to the webinar, on July 4, 2020, the History Channel aired a documentary on the decades-long story titled, ""The Swamp Ghost.""In sum, it was true that a man had made a discovery inside the ""Swamp Ghost"" airplane after it was found in the jungle."	true
3481	The mob attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is the first severe breach of its property since the British troops set fire to the building in August 1814.	As an angry pro-Trump mob breached the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, leaving behind death and destruction, many wondered if this was the first time such an event had occurred there. While the Capitol had seen violence and destruction before during its more than two centuries-old history, it was nothing quite like the events of 2021.The riots on Jan. 6, 2021, were the first time an angry armed mob breached the walls of the building and rioted against election proceedings at the incitement of a sitting U.S. president ‚Äî but not the first time it had been violently breached. The last time such an intrusion had occurred was in 1814 by the British armed forces.The Capitol‚Äôs construction began in 1793, and intermittently continued even after 1800 when the building was occupied by the Congress, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, and the courts of the District of Columbia. Work continued on the South Wing of the Capitol in 1811, but funding was diverted because of a second war with Britain.The War of 1812 between the United States and Britain resulted in a broad attack on Washington by British troops. In August 1814, according to the U.S. Senate‚Äôs historical highlights, word reached the Capitol that ‚ÄúBritish forces had swept aside the defending American army at Bladensburg, Maryland, and would occupy Washington by dusk. By late afternoon, British soldiers had marched on the Capitol, torching just about everything in sight.‚ÄùThe burning by the British left the Capitol as ‚Äúa most magnificent ruin,‚Äù according to architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe. They torched major rooms in the Capitol. The White House, the navy yard, and several American warships were also burned. The Capitol was not completely destroyed, however.Since then, the Capitol has seen bombings, violent attacks, and an attempted assassination of a president. In 1954, four armed Puerto Rican separatists opened fire in the House of Representatives. The years 1915, 1971, and 1983¬†saw different bombings around the building. All these attacks resulted in no casualties.	true

1157	"A movie began with a genuine disclaimer that warned viewers of an ""unlikable female protagonist."""	"On Nov. 29, 2022, a picture was shared on Reddit with a caption that claimed a movie began with a unique disclaimer. The warning purportedly read, ""Content Warning: This film contains flashing lights, themes of trauma, and an unlikable female protagonist. Viewer discretion advised."" The caption of the Reddit post said that the movie was rated PG-13, but did not identify title.This claim was true. The disclaimer was displayed at the beginning of the film ""Not Okay,"" which was written and directed by Quinn Shepard. It was released on the Hulu streaming service on July 29, 2022.According to an interview with Shepard published by IndieWire.com, the ""unlikable female protagonist"" disclaimer at the beginning of the ""internet satire"" film was not a joke. Shepard said that the message at the beginning of ""Not Okay"" was added after viewers raised concerns during test screenings before the film was released:""The content warning was borne out of, to be honest, our test screenings,"" she said during a recent interview with IndieWire. ""We un-ironically and consistently got responses from ‚Äî I'm not going to say what demographic, but you might be able to guess ‚Äî people who were quite literally like, 'Why would someone make a movie with an unlikable woman?' It's something I've repeatedly heard, and a lot of my other writer friends have as well. If you portray flawed women or women who reflect societal flaws, you get notes like, 'I literally don't understand why you tell a story about this character.'""Shephard couldn't wrap her head around that, mostly because films featuring unlikeable male protagonists are often hailed as modern masterpieces, from ""American Psycho"" to ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" Audiences understood that those films were ""a statement and not an endorsement,"" Shephard said. Why can't the same apply to ""Not Okay""?According to a synopsis on IMDb.com, ""Not Okay"" tells the story of a woman, Danni Sanders, who is portrayed by actor Zoey Deutch. Sanders doesn't have many social media followers, so she pretends (with the help of a green screen and some picture-editing tools) to be on a trip to Paris, France. However, things later take an unexpected turn.Danni Sanders (Zoey Deutch), an aimless aspiring writer with no friends, no romantic prospects and - worst of all - no followers, fakes an Instagram-friendly trip to Paris in the hopes of boosting her social media clout. When a terrifying incident strikes the City of Lights, Danni unwittingly falls into a lie bigger than she ever imagined. She ""returns"" a hero, even striking up an unlikely friendship with Rowan (Mia Isaac), a real trauma survivor dedicated to societal change, and scooping up the man of her dreams, Colin (Dylan O'Brien).

4283	Persons protesting the police-custody death of George Floyd defaced a statue of an abolitionist in Philadelphia.	"In the waves of protests that swept across U.S. and European cities beginning in May 2020 after the policy-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, numerous localities removed, or announced plans to remove, various statues and monuments memorializing persons connected with segregation or racism, such as those who were involved with the slave trade or were prominent figures in the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War.In some cases, however, protesters did not wait for official action to take place and instead defaced, vandalized, and/or pulled down statues themselves.  One such instance of this activity that was widely publicized on social media had to do with the mistaken defacement of a statue of someone said to have been a prominent abolitionist:The pictured statue is one of Matthias Baldwin which stands outside Philadelphia City Hall.  During the ""early days of unrest in Philadelphia"" following the death of George Floyd, protesters doused the statue with red paint and spray-painted the words ""colonizer"" and ""murderer"" on its pedestal:A spokesperson for Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney‚Äôs office confirmed that ‚Äúthe statue of Matthias Baldwin, along with other statues in the area of Philadelphia‚Äôs City Hall, was tagged with paint and graffiti at some point during the first days of protests that took place in Philadelphia. There has been no subsequent vandalism of the Baldwin statue in recent days.""But Baldwin, a 19th century figure most prominent for being the founder of one of Philadelphia's most successful businesses, the Matthias Baldwin Locomotive Works, was an incongruous target of such protests. As his entry in the 1899 National Cyclopaedia of American Biography noted, Baldwin's racial outlook was unusually enlightened for the time and place in which he lived:
His heart and purse seemed always ready to respond to appeals from deserving sources. He opened a school for colored children in Philadelphia, and for years paid the salaries of its teachers. When, in 1835, an appeal was made for the support of Pompey Hunt, a negro evangelist, he himself guaranteed a generous sum to enable him to continue preaching the Gospel. Mr. Baldwin's interest in the cause of the negro race and his earnest advocacy of abolition were of life long duration, and during the stormy times before the civil war, were very often quoted to his disadvantage by business competitors. But his life was governed by the convictions of his conscience, and, come what might, he could not be moved.
But the defacement of Baldwin's statue in Philadelphia may have had the silver lining of bringing his laudable historic efforts to public attention, as The Philadelphia Inquirer observed:
Baldwin, who created one of the largest a locomotive manufacturing firms of his time, was an outspoken critic against slavery during the early 1800s, arguing for the right of African Americans to vote and founding a school in the city for black children. Baldwin‚Äôs statue was erected in 1906, and placed in its current spot outside City Hall in 1936.Jim Fennell, the president of the volunteer group Friends of Matthias Baldwin Park, said he was upset when he saw the images circulating online, particularly one photo that showed an unidentified protester appearing to whip the statue.‚ÄúHe was not the man to whip, because he was ahead of his time,‚Äù Fennell said.Despite the initial damage, Fennel said the incident has had the unintended effect of causing people to seek out knowledge about Baldwin and why the city erected a statue in his honor."	true
3904	A video shows a chameleon quickly changing colors as it climbs a series of connected colored pencils.	"In mid-November 2020, a video supposedly showing a chameleon rapidly changing colors as it climbed a series of connected colored pencils went viral on social media. One posting of this video on TikTok racked up more than 6 million views: This is not a genuine video of a chameleon changing colors but a composite video that used digital editing software to change the chameleon's colors.¬†In the final seconds of this video, a message in Chinese is displayed that loosely translates (via Google) to ""this is a composite video."" This disclaimer was edited out of some versions of this video that circulated on social media.¬†The above-displayed video was originally posted by the Instagram account @Pardalischamereon in July 2020. This account, which appears to be dedicated to one person's pet chameleon, also identified this video as a ""composite movie"" in the original posting. @Pardalischamereon elaborated on this in the comments section, writing that the color changes were made with the software Adobe Premiere Pro.One reason this video may have fooled some viewers is that it plays on a common misconception about chameleons. While many people seem to be under the impression that chameleons change colors based on the surface they are touching, this is not the case.National Geographic explored this topic in a 2018 article:Contrary to a widely held belief ‚Äî bolstered by the likes of Disney‚Äôs Tangled, which co-stars a chameleon named Pascal‚Äîthese enigmatic lizards cannot transform the color of their skin to match any background.‚ÄúPeople believe that if you put a chameleon on chessboard it‚Äôs going to hide by taking the same pattern or color, but this is of course is not true,‚Äù says Michel Milinkovitch, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Geneva and an expert on animal skin color.And videos on YouTube, he says, some of which show the lizards changing colors as they encounter different surfaces or objects, ‚Äúare completely fake.‚ÄùIf chameleons don't change colors for camouflage, why do they change their colors? Chameleons generally change colors for two reasons: To regulate body heat and to communicate.¬†Live Science reports:Changing skin color is an important part of communication among chameleons. According to the San Diego Zoo, a chameleon's skin changes colors in response to its emotions, such as anger or fear, changes in light, temperature or humidity.The brighter the color, the more dominant the male is, and the more attractive he is to females. A submissive male is usually brown or gray. Females use their colors to accept or reject a suitor, and their color can also indicate that she is pregnant."	false
5984	Parkland mass shooting survivor Emma Gonz√°lez admitted to bullying a former student who later killed seventeen people.	"In March 2018, conspiracy theorists made another attempt to use disinformation in order to discredit gun safety activist Emma Gonz√°lez by accusing her of ""bullying"" her former high school classmate accused of killing fourteen students and three staff members at a month earlier. In this case, conservative blogs such as LouderWithCrowder.com and right-leaning magazines like The American Spectator circulated a brief clip taken from her remarks at a rally on 17 February 2018 in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, calling it ""proof"" that Gonz√°lez admitted to mistreating the suspect, Nikolas Cruz:Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him? You didn't know this kid, OK? We did.But placed in context, Gonz√°lez's remarks reveal that students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had alerted officials over concerns about Cruz's potentially dangerous behavior and had not ostracized merely out of spite:So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again. We did, time and time again. Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn't know this kid. OK, we did. We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He would not have harmed that many students with a knife.The Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed shortly after the 14 February 2018 shooting that they had received reports concerning the suspect but failed to act upon them.Prior to being expelled from the school the month of the attack, Cruz had also reportedly threatened online to commit a school shooting and was suspended for attacking a student who was dating his former girlfriend. He also reportedly posted racist and homophobic thoughts in a private chat group and also wrote, ""I think I am going to kill people,"" later claiming that he did so in jest.Another Marjory Stoneman Douglas High student, Isabelle Robinson, called the idea that she and her classmates could have prevented the shooting by being nicer to their attacker ""a slap to the face"" to both the survivors and the victims in a 27 March 2018 op-ed in the New York Times.Robinson wrote that she first encountered Cruz when he hit her in the back with an apple and displayed no remorse. A year later, she recalled, she was assigned to tutor him as part of the school's peer counseling report:Being a peer counselor was the first real responsibility I had ever had, my first glimpse of adulthood, and I took it very seriously.Despite my discomfort, I sat down with him, alone. I was forced to endure his cursing me out and ogling my chest until the hourlong session ended. When I was done, I felt a surge of pride for having organized his binder and helped him with his homework.Looking back, I am horrified. I now understand that I was left, unassisted, with a student who had a known history of rage and brutality."	false

3429	In January 2021, OnlyFans removed Donald Trump's account in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.	"In the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol, online platforms and social networks took action against outgoing President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the mob of his supporters who attacked and breached the Capitol.¬†Twitter temporarily froze Trump's account on the night of Jan. 6, before permanently banning him two days later, finding that he had violated its policies on glorifying violence. Facebook suspended Trump indefinitely, and for at least two weeks. YouTube barred Trump from uploading new content for at least seven days. The video-streaming platform Twitch indefinitely disabled his account, and the video-sharing app TikTok removed excerpts from Trump's speech at the Jan. 6 ""Save America"" rally in Washington, D.C.In light of these suspensions, some online observers speculated¬†(many of them jokingly), that the 45th president might ultimately resort to using OnlyFans, a subscription-based, video-sharing service that is best known as a platform for sex workers and pornography.¬†However, in a widely shared tweet posted on Jan. 9, one Twitter user appeared to have found evidence that Trump was already using OnlyFans, and had already been banned in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol:The @realdonaldtrump account did exist on OnlyFans, as recently as Jan. 9, 2021, as this archived link shows, and it was removed from the platform later that day. However, the account did not actually belong to Trump or his campaign, and it was removed precisely for impersonating the outgoing president.In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for OnlyFans told Snopes:Donald Trump has never had an OnlyFans account.

6155	"Vyacheslav Ivanov, a former executive at Rosatom, was killed in a February 2018 plane crash as part of a ""deep state"" plot to cover up corruption by the Clintons."	"In February 2018, just after a deadly plane crash in Russia, conspiracy theorists seized on a name among the rosters of those killed to claim that one of them was an executive at Russia's nuclear agency Rosatom; they further speculated that the incident was a CIA operation designed to silence individuals who could provide information that might be damaging to 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.¬†On 11 February 2018, Saratov Airlines flight 6W703 crashed near Moscow, killing all 71 people on board. Later that day, the meme emerged:Hi, I'm Vyacheslav Ivanov. Today I died in a plane crash in Russia. Oh, and I'm CFO of Rosatom. Uranium One? That part is just a coincidence.¬†Uranium One is the name of a mining company taken over by Rosatom in 2010, but also shorthand for a debunked conspiracy theory which alleges that Hillary Clinton, acting in her role as Secretary of State, singlehandedly transferred 20 percent of the United States' uranium reserves to Russia, as part of the Rosatom takeover of Uranium One. She did this, according to the conspiracy theory, in exchange for $145 million in donations from Uranium One investors to the Clinton Foundation. (We have previously debunked this.)On 11 February 2018, conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi appeared on the Alex Jones Show on InfoWars, to outline the new plane crash twist in the Uranium One saga:It turns out, on the plane crash there were several executives of Rosatom...One of the top ones was a gentleman named Ivanov, who ended up being the CFO of Rosatom...The suspicions are that it may have been a U.S. intelligence agency CIA hit, to kill these Rosatom executives to prevent them from testifying or being available to give testimony in the beginning enquiries on the whole Uranium One scandal, which I'm predicting will be the end of Robert Mueller's career.¬†Corsi did not name any executives other than Ivanov.¬†The notorious fake news web site Neon Nettle also got in on the act, claiming the purported death of Vyacheslav Ivanov was proof of a cover-up of Clinton corruption:¬†The ""Deep State"" now seems [to be] scrambling to remove any ""loose ends"" who might testify against the Clintons.The man shown in the meme is Vyacheslav Ivanov, who was chief financial officer of Rosatom until May 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile.¬†There was also someone named Vyacheslav Ivanov killed on Flight 6W703, according to a list of names published by Russia's Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters.¬†However, they are not the same person. Firstly, the man killed on Flight 6W703 (Passenger #32) was born in 1986. In 1987, Rosatom's former chief financial officer Vyacheslav Ivanov began studying for a degree in Computers and Networks at the Moscow Institute of Radioelectronics, according to his LinkedIn profile; either the #QAnon crowd either missed this detail, did some extremely creative math and hoped no one would notice, or Ivanov is a genius the likes of which the world has never seen.Unfortunately, the ""genius"" theory doesn't hold water, either. The former Rosatom CFO posted photographs of himself to Facebook on 12 February 2018, a day after the crash of Flight 6W703.The false Ivanov conspiracy theory was not the only one that spread online in the aftermath of the crash. Buzzfeed¬†documented right-wing and conspiracy theorist web sites that claimed, also falsely, that Sergei Millian, a Belarussian-American businessman reported to be a source for the dossier at the heart of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in the months leading up to the 2016 election, was also among the dead.¬†¬†"	false
6239	Sen. Jeff Klein (D-New York) is part of negotiations regarding anti-sexual harassment laws ‚Äî after he was accused of the same offense.	"As state lawmakers in New York focus on changing sexual misconduct laws, a Democrat who has aligned himself with Republicans drew scrutiny for being involved despite being accused of harmful behavior by a former campaign volunteer.The allegations against state Sen. Jeff Klein (D-New York) by Erica Vladimer were first published in the Huffington Post on 10 January 2018. She told the news site that Klein had forced himself on her outside of a bar in April 2015.Klein is the leader of the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of eight Democratic lawmakers who caucus with state Senate Republicans. The senator has not been charged in connection with the alleged encounter. He has expressed support for Gov. Andrew Cuomo's plan to expand anti-sexual harassment laws, saying:I think we have to strengthen our sexual harassment laws, and I intend to push to make that happen.Vladimir, who volunteered for Klein during his 2014 campaign, said she was smoking a cigarette with the senator when he accosted her:All of a sudden there was a hand on the back of my head and he shoved his tongue down my throat. In my head it lasted forever, I don't think it lasted even three seconds.Both Klein and his longtime partner, fellow Democratic state Sen. Diane Savino, have denied Vladimir's account. The day that Vladimir's accusation was published, said in a conference call:I want to be crystal clear: This alleged incident never happened nor did anything inappropriate happen in any fashion that evening.Klein called for an investigation on the matter by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics. Vladimir issued a statement saying that she did not plan to sue Klein, and that she would cooperate with the commission's investigation.Cuomo called for legislation that would curtail the use of confidentiality agreements in harassment cases involving members of ""all public entities and branches of government¬†‚Äî state and local ‚Äî unless it is the express preference of the victim."" He also said during an appearance at the New York City edition of the Womens' March on 20 January 2018 that abusers and harassers should be on the hook for settling or fighting lawsuits out of pocket, instead of using taxpayer dollars to do so:We have proposed in Albany an unprecedented women's empowerment agenda that says no more government money for sexual harassment. If someone wants to abuse a woman's right, then they're liable, pay for it with their own money, not government money.However, at least one state Democrat, Sen. Liz Krueger, was critical of what she described as a lack of inclusion of female lawmakers in discussions on the matter:I always think women should be in every negotiation. We're 52 percent of the population of New York state so I don't see any reason for us to be locked out of the room.But Klein's director of communications, Candice Giove, told us via e-mail that the office rejects the idea that women are being left out of the process:""Four men"" in a room is a myth. The Secretary to the Governor, Senator Klein's Chief of Staff and a number of other women in senior positions who work for the executive and the legislature are in the room, and integral to budget negotiations."	true
2052	"""Little Demon"" is an animated comedy series about Satan and the Antichrist and was created by a company that's owned by Disney."	"On Sept. 5, 2022, U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., shared concerns over a TV commercial that purportedly aired on the ABC TV network during a college football game between Florida State and Louisiana State University. The Republican politician said that he found the trailer for the new FXX animated comedy series ""Little Demon"" to be ""disturbing,"" posting that it contained references to hell and Satan and that the main character plays the Antichrist. He also included in the post that the FX and FXX channels are owned by The Walt Disney Company, as is ABC.While we can't fact-check someone's opinion of a trailer for a comedy cartoon series that's made for adults, airs at a later hour, and stars comedic actor Danny DeVito to voice Satan, we can verify whether the information mentioned in Johnson's Facebook post was true. After looking into the matter, we found that Johnson did not misinform regarding ""Little Demon's"" plot, cast, and reviews.According to the official FX website, the plot for the animated comedy cartoon does revolve around ""a mother and her Antichrist daughter,"" who ""are constantly thwarted by monstrous forces, including Satan.""The same website also includes this longer summary:13 years after being impregnated by Satan, a reluctant mother, Laura, and her Antichrist daughter, Chrissy, attempt to live an ordinary life in Delaware, but are constantly thwarted by monstrous forces, including Satan, who yearns for custody of his daughter's soul.FX's animated comedy series¬†""Little Demon""¬†features the voices of Aubrey Plaza as ""Laura;"" Danny DeVito as ""Satan;"" and Lucy DeVito as their daughter ""Chrissy;"" with Eugene Cordero recurring as Chrissy's best friend ""Bennigan;"" Lennon Parham recurring as Laura's neighbor ""Darlene,"" and Michael Shannon recurring as the ""Unshaven Man.""

Aubrey Plaza serves as an executive producer along with¬†Fowler, Kirschner, Valla, Dan Harmon, Jersey Films 2nd¬†Avenue's Jake, Lucy and Danny DeVito, and ShadowMachine¬†(Monica Mitchell, Corey Campodonico and Alex Bulkley).¬†Steve Levy serves as a producer on the project.¬†""Little Demon""¬†is produced by FX Productions.Johnson's reference in his Facebook post to a quote from ""the actress who voices Laura,"" the main character on ""Little Demon,"" was to actor and executive producer Aubrey Plaza. Plaza is perhaps best known for her role as April Ludgate on the comedy TV series, ""Parks and Recreation.""According to Johnson, Plaza once said of the new FXX show, ""I love that we are normalizing paganism. Laura is a pagan. She's a witch. She's jacked."" This was a real quote from Plaza.After a bit of digging around, we found a YouTube video of the interview. It was uploaded to the CBR Presents YouTube channel in July 2022. The moderator's question begins at the 1:27 mark. We recommend watching the entire interview for context regarding the tone in which all of the remarks were delivered about the animated comedy series that's made for adults:Lastly, the two paragraphs in Johnson's post about a review for ""Little Demon"" truly did come from a real review by Slant Magazine.As of September 2022, new episodes of ""Little Demon"" were airing on FXX at 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time and were also available to stream on Hulu, both of which are owned by Disney. (Disney owns a majority of Hulu.)Additionally, the unofficial website Disney Plus Informer reported that the show was purportedly streaming on Disney Plus in Australia and New Zealand. It's unclear if it will ever be made available on Disney Plus for American audiences, as it's already on Hulu in the states. Additionally, to be clear, ""Little Demon"" does not air on the Disney Channel in the U.S."	true

Trolling, that is, as a political strategy.Mr. Mauldin, who has not been previously identified as the creator of the website, said he had built and paid for it on his own, and not for the Trump campaign. But the campaign knows about the websites, raising the prospect that the president‚Äôs re-election effort condoned what is, in essence, a disinformation operation run by one of its own.Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign‚Äôs communications director, did not directly address that issue, though he said it was ‚Äúgreat that talented supporters of President Trump use their time to help his re-election.‚Äù‚ÄúWe appreciate their efforts in their own time with parodies like this that help the cause,‚Äù he added."	false

5714	Nike released a statement urging disgruntled consumers to donate clothing to veterans rather than burning it.	"While several online fabrications were designed to elicit anger against former pro football star Colin Kaepernick (""satirically"" or otherwise) after the announcement of his inclusion in a Nike ad campaign, at least one fake item rebuked consumers who professed a desire to burn their own Nike apparel in protest against Kaepernick and the sportswear company.In September 2018 a popular Facebook post proffered an alleged ""response from Nike"" regarding the angry outcry that followed their announcement that Kaepernick would be featured in the ad campaign marking the 30th anniversary of the Nike slogan ""Just Do It"": At least one user who shared the post claimed that they found the text posted on the public relations web site PRWeb, but that the notice had since been deleted. A staff member for PRWeb referred us to Nike but would not comment further. But no such statement was ever spotted or archived from Nike's social media accounts, and the company confirmed to us via email that it did not originate with them.The mention of people ""burning"" their Nike apparel could be a reference to separate pictures that spread online claiming to show a person burning his Nike shoes while wearing them. In reality, though, that picture set was a hoax posted by a Twitter user who employed a photograph of some other foot burn patient.The claim that veterans comprise ""nearly a fifth of all homeless people"" does not match up with federal data. According to the department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. homeless veteran population increased in 2017 to an estimated 40,000 people. But that figure constitutes far less than 20 percent of the overall homeless population, which is estimated to be around 554,000 people.Kaepernick has been the subject of right-wing criticism since he began ""taking a knee"" during the playing of the national anthem before games in protest of extrajudicial killings on the part of police, a move that he undertook at the suggestion of a U.S. Army veteran and former National Football League player, Nate Boyer.After Kaepernick generated another round of controversy by announcing that he would be part of the Nike campaign,  ""reports"" from spurious web sites claimed that the company had quickly dumped him; that Nike lost contracts with both the University of Alabama and the federal government; and that pro basketball hall-of-famer Michael Jordan pulled his signature Air Jordan brand from the company.While President Donald Trump has claimed that Nike was suffering because of a purported boycott incited by the Kaepernick ad campaign, social media data reportedly showed a lack of ""a strong negative call"" against the company."	false
5121	A judge set convicted registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein free on probation in a sex-trafficking case after a meeting with the Clintons.	In July 2019, convicted sex offender and hedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on charges related to the sex trafficking of minors. In addition to the severity of the alleged crimes, Epstein‚Äôs arrest made headlines due to his connections to well-known public figures and politicians, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton.The news of Epstein‚Äôs arrest sent political partisans into overdrive as they attempted to show that politicians on their side were less involved with Epstein than politicians on the other side. On 15 July 2019, the Daily World Update website waded into this contretemps by publishing an article positing that a judge in the case had set Epstein free on probation and without bail after meeting with Bill and Hillary Clinton:After Clintons Meet With Judge, Epstein Gets ProbationIf you‚Äôve been following the news on the case of Jeffrey Epstein, you know the sordid details that the supposed hedge-fund manager is accused of: counts of providing underage women as sexual slaves to scores of famous men, including Donald Trump, Dick Cheney, and entertainer Phil Collins. Some people say Bill Clinton was also on that list. Well, it looks like those some people may have been some kind of balls-on right.Adjudicator Judge Hammond Dixcheeze was set to deliberate on Epstein‚Äôs possible bail amount this Monday, when several witnesses saw former President Bill Clinton enter his chambers for a private chat. One hour later, Clinton exited, and the judge announced that the accused would not require any bail payment and would be simply set free on probation. Sound suspicious?	false
1401	A single eruption from a volcano puts 10,000 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of human activity has throughout history.	"The myth that a single volcanic eruption puts more CO2 into the atmosphere than all of mankind to date, let alone 10,000 times more, is one of the most pervasive as well as one of the most demonstrably false climatological claims out there. It stems, ultimately, from a geologist named Ian Rutherford Plimer, infamous for writing a widely discredited book titled Heaven and Earth, which attempted to argue that humans have had an insignificant effect on global climate.In a 2009 editorial written for Australia‚Äôs ABC news, he echoed a sentiment he had argued with similar inelegance in his book by providing the following statement, widely spread nearly word-for-word in climate skeptic circles, without any supporting citation: ""Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day.""This brief statement ‚Äî a mere 28 words ‚Äî yields a remarkably dense buffet of spurious claims and outright falsehoods. It also is rife with ambiguity. What numbers is he actually comparing? What is a volcanic ‚Äúcough‚Äù? From a fact-checking standpoint, there are no interpretations of Plimer‚Äôs second sentence that can produce a factual assertion. The only way to make the first sentence work is with a scientifically useless comparison. All other interpretations fall well short of reality.That useless comparison would be the total mass of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere by human activity (roughly calculated here by taking the roughly 120 ppm rise in CO2 since pre-industrial times converted into 936.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide gas) compared to the total mass of the entire atmosphere (estimated to be around 5,100,000 gigatons). This yields roughly 1 part post-industrial CO2 rise in 10,000 parts of the entire atmosphere.As CO2, in total, makes up only about 0.06% by mass of the atmosphere and 0.04% by volume, this is not exactly revelatory. The question is not about how much other stuff is in the atmosphere. Rather, the question is about how much stuff humans are adding that wouldn't already be in the atmosphere, and, as a result, what the the potential for that amount would be to affect climate ‚Äî a topic for which there is a wide scientific consensus.The erroneous interpretation that many have made from Plimer‚Äôs statement would be the assertion that the total amount of carbon released by humanity throughout all time (represented here as gigatons or petagrams of carbon, not carbon dioxide) represents only 1/10,000th (0.01%) of the total mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These numbers do not check out, even when checked against collected data that ends in the year 2000, according calculations provided by the federally-funded Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center:According to Houghton and Hackler, land-use changes from 1850-2000 resulted in a net transfer of 154 PgC to the atmosphere. During that same period, 282 PgC were released by combustion of fossil fuels, and 5.5 additional PgC were released to the atmosphere from cement manufacture. This adds up to 154 + 282 + 5.5 = 441.5 PgC, of which 282/444.1 = 64% is due to fossil-fuel combustion.Atmospheric CO2 concentrations rose from 288 ppmv in 1850 to 369.5 ppmv in 2000, for an increase of 81.5 ppmv, or 174 PgC. In other words, about 40% (174/441.5) of the additional carbon has remained in the atmosphere, while the remaining 60% has been transferred to the oceans and terrestrial biosphere.The 369.5 ppmv of carbon in the atmosphere, in the form of CO2, translates into 787 PgC, of which 174 PgC has been added since 1850. From [...] above, we see that 64% of that 174 PgC, or 111 PgC, can be attributed to fossil-fuel combustion. This represents about 14% (111/787) of the carbon in the atmosphere in the form of CO2.A more scientifically valid approach, perhaps, would be to compare annual volcanic emissions fluxes to annual anthropogenic fluxes, as the carbon cycle is an ever-shifting network of sources and sinks of CO2 that need to be accounted for. A 2013 review attempted to estimate the annual contribution of CO2 emitted from all volcanoes (active and passive) and other tectonic sources on Earth per year, coming up with a figure of 540 megatons per year (note that these measurements, unlike the ones above, represent the total mass of CO2 not solely the carbon component):[CO2 from the plumes of actively erupting volcanoes]:Using the available data from plume measurements from 33 degassing volcanoes we determine a total CO2 flux of 59.7 Mt/yr. Extrapolating this to ~150 active volcanoes produces a total of 271 Mt/yr CO2.[CO2 passively vented by active volcanoes]:Extrapolation of the measured 6.4 Mt/yr of CO2 emitted from the flanks of 30 historically active volcanoes to all 550 historically active volcanoes produces a global emission rate of 117 Mt/yr.[CO2 from other volcanic sources]:Perez et al. (2011) calculated the global emission from volcanic lakes to be 94 Mt/yr CO2. The sum of these fluxes produces an updated estimate of the global subaerial volcanic CO2 flux of 474 Mt/yr. Emissions from tectonic, hydrothermal and inactive volcanic areas contribute a further 66 Mt/yr to this total [...], producing a total subaerial volcanic emission of 540 Mt/yr.While the authors of this study note that this is an exceedingly rough estimate, they also point out that it is orders of magnitude lower than estimates of the annual flux of CO2 added to the atmosphere through human activity, currently estimated to be around 35,000 Mt/year:The global subaerial CO2 flux we report is higher than previous estimates, but remains insignificant relative to anthropogenic emissions, which are two orders of magnitude greater at 35,000 Mt/yr.Once again, the actual numbers bear no resemblance to Plimer‚Äôs claims. It would have to be a pretty heavy volcanic ‚Äúcough‚Äù from a ‚Äúsingle volcano‚Äù to, by itself, increase Earth‚Äôs annual volcanic CO2 flux by a factor of 65.Absurdity notwithstanding, numerous online claims reference specific volcanic eruptions purported to have added more than the total emission of anthropogenic carbon ever released (a value, estimated above, to be more than 282 Gt of carbon). The most commonly cited are the 15 June 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo and the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Mount St. Helens released 0.01 Gt to the atmosphere and Mount Pinatubo released 0.05 Gt. Put another way:There is no question that very large volcanic eruptions can inject significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens vented approximately 10 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in only 9 hours.However, it currently takes humanity only 2.5 hours to put out the same amount. While large explosive eruptions like this are rare and only occur globally every 10 years or so, humanity's emissions are ceaseless and increasing every year."	false

718	Account by Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin describes his taking Communion on the moon.	"One of the smaller details lost amidst the tremendous historic and scientific achievements of the Apollo 11 mission that landed the first two human beings on the moon in July 1969 was that it also marked the first occasion on which a Christian took the sacrament of Communion on an astronomical body other than Earth. This event took place in the interval between the lunar module's landing on the moon on 20 July 1969 and Neil Armstrong's taking his first steps on the lunar surface several hours later; during that period, astronaut Buzz Aldrin privately observed Communion using elements he had brought with him to the moon:Example:Communion on the Moon:
July 20th, 1969Forty years ago today two human beings changed history by walking on the surface of the moon. But what happened before Buzz Aldrin (pictured in the LM, left) and Neil Armstrong exited the Lunar Module is perhaps even more amazing, if only because so few people know about it.I'm talking about the fact that Buzz Aldrin took communion on the surface of the moon. Some months after his return, he wrote about it in Guideposts magazine. And a few years ago I had the privilege of meeting him myself. I asked him about it and he confirmed the story to me, and I wrote about in my book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About God (But Were Afraid to Ask).The background to the story is that Aldrin was an elder at his Presbyterian Church in Texas during this period in his life, and knowing that he would soon be doing something unprecedented in human history, he felt he should mark the occasion somehow, and he asked his pastor to help him. And so the pastor consecrated a communion wafer and a small vial of communion wine. And Buzz Aldrin took them with him out of the Earth's orbit and on to the surface of the moon.He and Armstrong had only been on the lunar surface for a few minutes when Aldrin made the following public statement: ""This is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way."" He then ended radio communication and there, on the silent surface of the moon, 250,000 miles from home, he read a verse from the Gospel of John, and he took communion. Here is his own account of what happened:In the radio blackout, I opened the little plastic packages which contained the bread and the wine. I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon, the wine slowly curled and gracefully came up the side of the cup. Then I read the Scripture, ""I am the vine, you are the branches. Whosoever abides in me will bring forth much fruit. Apart from me you can do nothing."" I had intended to read my communion passage back to earth, but at the last minute [they] had requested that I not do this. NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O'Hare [sic], the celebrated opponent of religion, over the Apollo 8 crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon at Christmas. I agreed reluctantly. I ate the tiny Host and swallowed the wine. I gave thanks for the intelligence and spirit that had brought two young pilots to the Sea of Tranquility. It was interesting for me to think: the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the very first food eaten there, were the communion elements. And of course, it's interesting to think that some of the first words spoken on the moon were the words of Jesus Christ, who made the Earth and the moon ‚Äî and Who, in the immortal words of Dante, is Himself the ""Love that moves the Sun and other stars.""Aldrin openly described his Communion experience on the moon in print several times, including an August 1969 interview with LIFE magazine, an October 1970 Guideposts article, and his 1973 book Return to Earth. The following account of his motivations and preparation is taken from Aldrin's 2009 book, Magnificent Desolation:Landing on the moon is not quite the same thing as arriving at Grandmother's for Thanksgiving. You don't hop out of the lunar module the moment the engine stops and yell, ""We're here! We're here!"" Getting out of the LM takes a lot of preparation, so we had built in several extra hours to our flight plan. We also figured it was wise to allow more time rather than less for our initial activities after landing, just in case anything had gone wrong during the flight.According to our schedule, we were supposed to eat a meal, rest awhile, and then sleep for seven hours after arriving on the moon. After all, we had already worked a long, full day and we wanted to be fresh for our extra-vehicular activity (EVA). Mission Control had notified the media that they could take a break and catch their breath since there wouldn't be much happening for several hours as we rested. But it was hard to rest with all that adrenaline pumping through our systems.Nevertheless, in an effort to remain calm and collected, I decided that this would be an excellent time for a ceremony I had planned as an expression of gratitude and hope. Weeks before, as the Apollo mission drew near, I had originally asked Dean Woodruff, pastor at Webster Presbyterian Church, where my family and I attended services when I was home in Houston, to help me come up with something I could do on the moon, some appropriate symbolic act regarding the universality of seeking. I had thought in terms of doing something overtly patriotic, but everything we came up with sounded trite and jingoistic. I settled on a well-known expression of spirituality: celebrating the first Christian Communion on the moon, much as Christopher Columbus and other explorers had done when they first landed in their ""new world.""I wanted to do something positive for the world, so the spiritual aspect appealed greatly to me, but NASA was still smarting from a lawsuit filed by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair after the Apollo 8 astronauts read from the biblical creation account in Genesis. O'Hair contended this was a violation of the constitutional separation of church and state. Although O'Hair's views did not represent mainstream America at that time, her lawsuit was a nuisance and a distraction that NASA preferred to live without.I met with Deke Slayton, one of the original ""Mercury Seven"" astronauts who ran our flight-crew operations, to inform him of my plans and that I intended to tell the world what I was doing. Deke said, ""No, that's not a good idea, Buzz. Go ahead and have communion, but keep your comments more general."" I understood that Deke didn't want any more trouble.So, during those first hours on the moon, before the planned eating and rest periods, I reached into my personal preference kit and pulled out the communion elements along with a three-by-five card on which I had written the words of Jesus: ""I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me."" I poured a thimbleful of wine from a sealed plastic container into a small chalice, and waited for the wine to settle down as it swirled in the one-sixth Earth gravity of the moon. My comments to the world were inclusive: ""I would like to request a few moments of silence ... and to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way."" I silently read the Bible passage as I partook of the wafer and the wine, and offered a private prayer for the task at hand and the opportunity I had been given.Neil watched respectfully, but made no comment to me at the time.Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind ‚Äî be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo 11 experience that by giving thanks to God. It was my hope that people would keep the whole event in their minds and see, beyond minor details and technical achievements, a deeper meaning ‚Äî a challenge, and the human need to explore whatever is above us, below us, or out there.Some sources asserted that Aldrin's taking of Communion was kept ""secret"" from the public by NASA due to an ongoing lawsuit filed by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair:The story of the secret communion service only emerged after the mission. Aldrin had originally planned to share the event with the world over the radio. However, at the time Nasa was still reeling from a lawsuit filed by the firebrand atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair, resulting in the ceremony never being broadcast. After the Apollo 8 crew had read out the Genesis creation account in orbit, O'Hair wanted a ban on Nasa astronauts practising religion on earth, in space or ""around and about the moon"" while on duty. She believed it violated the constitutional separation between church and stateHowever, it's not completely true that the public was kept in the dark about the event until many years later. Although Aldrin maintained that NASA asked him not to broadcast his observance of Communion, news accounts released while the Apollo 11 mission was in progress reported that Aldrin was bringing Communion bread with him to the moon and would be joining Earth-bound parishioners in observing Communion from the lunar surface, as noted in this 20 July 1969 Associated Press dispatch:Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. went to the moon today with a piece of Communion bread he will use there to symbolize fellowship with his home church on earth.When the Rev. M. Dean Woodruff [minister of the Webster Presbyterian church where Aldrin was an elder] brought out the bread for Communion, a portion of the loaf had been broken away. The minister explained that Aldrin took a portion of the loaf with him on the moon trip and at some time during the afternoon, after the moon landing is made, Aldrin would symbolically join the other parishioners in Communion during one of his rest periods.Buzz Aldrin's observance of Communion was dramatized in an episode of the 1998 HBO mini-series From the Earth to the Moon:¬†The handwritten card containing the Bible verse that Aldrin recited during his lunar Communion service was offered at auction in 2007."	true

48	"An image that went viral in August 2023 genuinely depicted a ""question mark"" formation in space."	"The viral photograph was a zoomed-in, cropped version of an image taken by a special camera on NASA's Webb Space Telescope. That image was a composite of multiple exposures.In August 2023, an image of outer space¬†went viral on social media¬†because it allegedly documented a mysterious formation in the shape of a ""question mark.""NASA's James Webb telescope has spotted a giant 'question mark' object in deep space
by u/penisslayer24 in DamnthatsinterestingThe viral photograph was authentic, though it was a zoomed-in version of a larger image by NASA's Webb Space Telescope.¬†The telescope's image was a composite of multiple exposures taken by its Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam).¬†Documenting a pair of forming stars (the bright, colorful objects in the image's center), the image was published on the telescope's official website on July 26, 2023. The discovery was titled ""Herbig-Haro 46/47."" The image's description stated:Herbig-Haro 46/47 is an important object to study because it is relatively young ‚Äì only a few thousand years old. Stars take millions of years to fully form. Targets like this also give researchers insight into how stars gather mass over time, potentially allowing them to model how our own Sun, a low-mass star, formed.Looking at the telescope's image, the ""question mark"" object was small, near the bottom border. (We created the graphic below, zooming in on the formation.) webbtelescope.orgOf the background objects ‚Äî which included the in-question formation ‚Äî the image's description stated:[...] A profusion of extremely distant galaxies dot Webb's view. Its composite NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) image is made up of several exposures, highlighting distant galaxies and stars. Blue objects with diffraction spikes are stars, and the closer they are, the larger they appear. White-and-pink spiral galaxies sometimes appear larger than these stars, but are significantly father away. The tiniest red dots, Webb's infrared specialty, are often the oldest, most distant galaxies.As of this writing, it was unknown what the ""question mark"" formation was ‚Äî though scientists speculated it was one or more galaxies. ""It is probably a distant galaxy, or potentially interacting galaxies (their interactions may have caused the distorted question mark-shape),"" representatives of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which manages the telescope's science operations, told¬†Space.com.Matt Caplan, an assistant professor of physics at Illinois State University, also¬†told Space.com:'The two distinct features could easily be merging galaxies in the background, with the upper part of the question mark being part of a larger galaxy getting tidally disrupted.

465	In 2021, BBC News displayed a real headline stating that actor Tom Hanks had been arrested on 135 counts of child porn possession.	"On May 9, 2023, a Twitter user posted a collage of images including what appeared to be a screenshot of a BBC report that actor Tom Hanks was arrested for possession of child pornography. The headline read: ""Tom Hanks arrested on 135 counts of child porn possession."" Beside it was a photograph of Hanks with his wife, Rita Wilson.Other photos in the collage appeared to show Hanks wearing an ankle bracelet and talking to law enforcement officers. (Image Via @ReturnOfKappy/Twitter)The alleged BBC screenshot was fabricated via digital editing, and its headline was false. It had been circulating, both on websites and on social media, since at least June 2021.A¬†search on BBC News for mentions of Hanks being arrested did not return any such report. Some of the BBC stories that popped up during the search displayed photographs whose backgrounds resembled that of the digitally altered image. Those photographs were taken when Hanks and Wilson were in Australia in 2021 for a film shooting. They both got COVID-19 during their stay in the country and were hospitalized and later released.¬†The fake screenshot appeared to have been created by digitally altering an actual BBC page. Reuters, which also fact-checked this image, found an archived BBC page dating from June 2021, some elements of which were an exact match for those found on the manipulated screenshot.¬†For example, the three bullet points under the Hanks piece, as Reuters' fact-check noted, appeared to be related to vaccines: ""The bullet points 'How can I get my second jab sooner?' 'What are the lockdown rules[?]' and ""Your Covid questions answered' can be made out under the headline and photograph of Tom Hanks and his wife.""Snopes had previously¬†fact-checked the claim about Hanks wearing an ankle bracelet and found it to be false. No legitimate sources have reported that Hanks was arrested, despite unfounded rumors dating back to 2020. The actor has been targeted by QAnon¬†conspiracy theorists, without evidence, for years as a supposed pedophile. For more information about QAnon, see Snopes'¬†explainer."	false
497	mRNA from COVID-19 vaccines has entered the food supply via genetically modified plants bred to contain it or through the consumption of vaccinated livestock.	"For several years, a collection of anti-vaccine activists, snake oil salesmen, anti-GMO activists, and deep state conspiracy grifters have been raising the alarm about the specter of the government secretly adding COVID-19 vaccines into the food supply.¬†One recent example came in the form of a TikTok video that concluded Americans must ""take back control of our democidal government"":¬† Broadly speaking, the general claims are that vaccines have entered the food chain through plants genetically modified to carry COVID-19 vaccine ingredients, and that vaccines have entered the food chain through meat due to the fact that livestock, they say, are now vaccinated with mRNA vaccines. (mRNA vaccines use¬†laboratory-created messenger RNA¬†‚Äî a genetic material that teaches cells how to make a proteins ‚Äî to trigger an immune response in the body.)Problems with these assertions about the vaccines are not in short supply. Here Snopes explains why all these claims lack merit.¬†Claims regarding COVID-19 vaccines ""in your salad"" have persisted on the internet and recirculated due to misreadings or misinterpretations of several press releases or scientific research.For example, in the viral TikTok, an ominous-sounding narrator explains that ""the genetic editing of plants to contain edible vaccines is well underway. Work is being done with bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, lettuce, rice, wheat, soybeans, and corn."" The narrator cites the company Medicago as an example of a company involved in such work.¬†Using Medicago as an example of an edible vaccine, as myriad anti-vaccine websites have, is misguided for several reasons ‚Äî most notably the fact that their product was an injected vaccine and in no way edible. The confusion stems from the fact that this company produced its active ingredient with genetically modified plants, but the final product saw that active ingredient extracted and purified into a more traditional vaccine.¬†Using Medicago as an example of mRNA technology is equally problematic, as Medicago's product in no way utilized or contained mRNA. Medicago's aim was to produce a Virus Like Particle (VLP) vaccine ‚Äî one that introduces materials that mimic portions of a virus to train the immune system to fight the actual virus.¬†Using Medicago as an example of something ""underway,"" as the TikTok video does, is also problematic. The company shut down entirely in February 2023 due, they said, to ""significant changes"" in the vaccine market.¬†Another item that frequently plays into fears about the government covertly adding mRNA to the nation's food supply stems from research conducted at the University of California at Riverside. A September 2021 news release described the significance of a grant recently awarded to Juan Pablo Giraldo, one of the university's professors:One of the challenges with [mRNA vaccine] technology is that it must be kept cold to maintain stability during transport and storage. If this new project is successful, plant-based mRNA vaccines ‚Äî which can be eaten ‚Äî could overcome this challenge with the ability to be stored at room temperature.¬†Mike Flynn, during a September 2021 podcast appearance, referenced this research, describing it as ""putting the vaccine in salad dressing.""While salad dressing plays no role, the concept here does involve a theoretically edible vaccine product that contains mRNA. Concept is the operative word, however. The research here is very much in its infancy.""My lab is developing tools that can deliver genetically encoded information into components of plants that can make a wide variety of molecules in the biopharmaceutical industry, like mRNA vaccines or protein-based drugs or hormones and lipids,"" Giraldo said in a January 2022 podcast interview.¬†While the press release discusses edible plants, Giraldo, in the podcast, discussed the potential mRNA technology as something that would be purified into some standardized form. His comments also showed how preliminary the research was at that time:There are very easy techniques to extract chloroplasts from plants‚Ä¶.¬† So they are like little micro-capsules similar to the lipid capsules that mRNA vaccines use. For example, the Moderna vaccine uses mRNA encapsulated in a lipid vesicle. Well, chloroplasts are formed by lipid vesicles, so you can envision that the contents of the biopharmaceuticals that we want to produce are already encapsulated there.¬†The bottom line is that plants that can produce vaccine ingredients are a topic of research, but that research is preliminary. In most cases, the idea is not to create edible food but to use plants to create active ingredients from food.¬†The TikTok video also suggests that ""gene editing is now officially in our meat industry,"" arguing that ""lobbyists for the cattlemen and pork associations in several states have confirmed that they will be using the mRNA COVID vaccines on their livestock.""This claim stems, in part, from an April 2023 tweet from ""attorney and freedom fighter"" Tom Renz regarding a proposed piece of legislation in Missouri:Renz' assertion ""that lobbyists for the cattlemen and pork associations in several states have CONFIRMED that they will be using the mRNA COVID vaccines on their livestock,"" is particularly suspect, given the complete lack of mRNA vaccines licensed for use on livestock in the U.S. An April 2023 statement from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) directly addressed the assertion in Renz' tweet:There are no current mRNA vaccines licensed for use in beef cattle in the United States. Cattle farmers and ranchers do vaccinate cattle to treat and prevent many diseases, but presently none of these vaccines include mRNA technology.In an email to The Associated Press, U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson Marissa Perry said that there are no licensed mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 for any animals. Even if livestock were vaccinated with mRNA vaccines, however, the idea that this would result in human exposure is¬†not tenable.¬†mRNA is extremely fragile and susceptible to heat. The notion that these precisely engineered sequences normally coated in specialized lipids would survive, unprotected, the slaughter of the vaccinated animal, the combustion of that animal's carcass, and the ingestion of that animal's meat inside one's stomach is simply unrealistic. ¬†Speaking to Agence France-Presse in January 2023, Timothy Mahony, a professorial research fellow at the Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation's Centre for Animal Science in Australia said that mRNA could not survive such a journey. ""There is no scientific basis for the claim that if someone was to consume meat or other tissues from an animal that had been vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine, it would enter their body,"" he said, explaining that¬†the digestive tract is ""designed to break down the large molecules in our food so we can absorb them.""The idea of using plants to create COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNA ones, is not new. Still, they remain largely theoretical concepts and would likely not, in practice, involve the actual consumption of plant material. Regardless, this technology is in its infancy and is not anywhere close to being ""underway.""The notion that mRNA is in meat, or will soon be in meat, stems from the false notion that mRNA vaccines for livestock are presently in use. They do not yet exist, and as such claims that their use is imminent are impossible. Even if such a vaccine were used, however, claims that such a use could transfer active vaccine ingredients to a consumer of that animal's meat are rooted in scientific impossibilities.¬†"	false
3459	A photograph shows Rudy Giuliani with Jake Angeli, who took part in the U.S. Capitol riot wearing horns.	"In the days following a riot at the United States Capitol by a pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6, 2021, a photograph started circulating on social media that supposedly showed U.S. President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani with Jake Angeli, a QAnon supporter known as the ""QAnon Shaman"" who stormed the building in a fur-covered, horned hat that some described as a ""Viking"" helmet:Both of these photographs are real.¬†The image on the left was taken on Jan. 6, 2021, as a pro-Trump mob forced their way into the Capitol, an incident that would end with five people, including a police officer, dead.The image on the right was taken at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Phoenix on Nov. 30, 2020, as Giuliani convened an unofficial ""hearing"" to discuss false allegations of voter fraud. AZ Central reported at the time:The Great Arizona Quest to Uncover a Conspiracy continued on Monday as nine Republican legislators convened a ‚Äúhearing‚Äù into voter fraud in the state‚Äôs election.Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani urged the Republican-run Legislature to throw out the results of the election and seize control of the state‚Äôs 11 electoral votes.‚ÄúIn your state, a lot of the fraud had to do with the mail-in system as it did in other places,‚Äù Giuliani told the self-appointed panel.Angeli shared this image to his Facebook page shortly after the event. While Angeli's Facebook page has since been deleted, an archived version can be seen here and a screenshot of the post is included below:It should be noted that taking a photograph with someone is not indicative of any meaningful relationship. In fact, a video of the event shows that Angeli's meeting with Giuliani was rather brief. Angeli was one of several people who approached Giuliani during a recess period of the hearing to shake his hand and take a picture. While it's a bit difficult to see, Angeli and Giuliani's brief meeting can be glimpsed at the 4:47:50 mark of the following video:While the above-displayed photograph does not indicate that Giuliani and Angeli had any meaningful relationship, it does suggest that Angeli, who stormed the U.S. Capitol, was a supporter of Giuliani's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. It should also be noted that a few hours before the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, Giuliani delivered a speech at Trump's rally in which he made false allegations of voter fraud and called for ""trial by combat.""Giuliani said:Over the next 10 days, we get to see the machines that are crooked, the ballots that are fraudulent. And if we‚Äôre wrong, we will be made fools of. But if we‚Äôre right, and lot of them will go to jail. So, let‚Äôs have trial by combat."	true
1414	Automobile components emit dangerous levels of cancer-causing benzene fumes.	"A commonly circulated online item about the dangers of benzene supposedly emitted by automobile components has been widely misunderstood:Do not turn on A/C immediately as soon as you enter the car! Please open the windows after you enter your car and do not turn ON the air-conditioning immediately.According to a research done, the car dashboard, sofa, air freshener emits Benzene, a Cancer causing toxin (carcinogen- take note of the heated plastic Smell in your car). In addition to causing cancer, it poisons your bones, causes anemia, and reduces white blood cells. Prolonged exposure will cause Leukemia, increasing the risk of cancer. May also cause miscarriage.Acceptable Benzene level indoors is 50 mg per sq. ft.. A car parked indoors with the windows closed will contain 400-800 mg of Benzene. If parked outdoors under the sun at a temperature above 60 degrees F, the Benzene level goes up to 2000-4000 mg, 40 times the acceptable level ... and the people inside the car will inevitably inhale an excess amount of the toxins.It is recommended that you open the windows and door to give time for the interior to air out before you enter. Benzene is a toxin that affects your kidney and liver, and is very difficult for your body to expel this toxic stuff.Many readers have come away from viewing this piece with the impression that it warns drivers not to use their cars' air conditioning because the A/C system itself is producing benzene, but what the article actually cautions against is the practice of turning on the air conditioning immediately upon entering an automobile. Motorists should instead, it says, roll down their windows in order to allow accumulated benzene fumes (allegedly emitted by other components, such as dashboards and upholstery) to vent from the car first before re-closing the windows and turning on the A/C.How much truth is there to this warning? Some evidence suggests an association between exposure to benzene and an excess risk of leukemia, as noted by the American Cancer Society (ACS):A considerable number of human studies provide evidence linking benzene and cancer. Initially, increased risks of leukemia, chiefly AML, were reported among workers with high levels of benzene exposure in the chemical, shoemaking, and oil refining industries. More recently, studies have focused on workers with relatively lower exposure.The human data are supported by animal studies. There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of benzene in experimental animals. Key animal studies support the finding of an excess risk of leukemia in humans from exposure to benzene by inhalation and ingestion. The details of these studies have been reviewed and found to support the association between benzene and cancer.But do automobiles really produce potentially cancer-causing levels of benzene? No studies have yet documented that claim to be true.A 2001 study of commuter exposure (in both cars and buses) in Korean urban areas found some relationship between automobile use and exposure to benzene, but its observations differed from the warning quoted above in some significant areas:The study found that exposure levels were significantly higher during the winter months, which suggests that automobile air conditioning use is not a major factor in benzene exposure.The Korean study itself did not establish a connection between commuter exposure to benzene and the onset of cancer.A 2007 German study on ""Toxicity of Parked Motor Vehicle Indoor Air"" which specifically tested the health effects of emissions from one new and one three-year-old vehicle exposed to ""parked in sunshine"" conditions found ""no apparent health hazard of parked motor vehicle indoor air"":Buters and his colleagues first collected molecules from the air inside a new car and a three-year-old vehicle of the same brand placed under 14,000 watts of light, where temperatures reached up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. They next exposed these compounds to human, mouse and hamster cells grown in lab dishes. These are commonly used to test toxicity.New car smell does not appear to be toxic, the scientists found. Air from the new car did cause a slight aggravation of the immune response that could affect people with allergies, but the same was not seen with the older vehicle.(The German study also found the total amount of volatile organic compounds in a new car to be one-tenth the level claimed in the e-mail for benzene alone.)The ACS similarly noted of this warning that:We found no published studies that confirm the claims of this e-mail. Benzene levels that exceed recommendations for chronic workplace exposure have been observed in some moving cars, but these levels seem unlikely in properly maintained cars.The e-mail did get one thing right, though: Upon returning to a closed car on warm days, you should optimally open the windows for a minute or so rather than leaving them closed and immediately turning on the air conditioning. The reason has nothing to do with benzene levels, however; rather, it's because when a car is parked in the sun with its windows rolled up, that condition can create a greenhouse effect which causes the interior of the vehicle to warm up to a temperature considerably higher than that of the outside air. Opening the windows for a few moments allows for the exchange of hot air from inside the vehicle with cooler air outside, speeding up the process of cooling off the car more than air conditioning alone would.Sources:Benzene and Cancer Risk. https://www.cancer.org/healthy/cancer-causes/chemicals/benzene.html.

2534	People in Victorian England were so afraid of zombies and vampires that they built cages to trap the undead in their graves in case the corpse reanimated.	"Since 2012 or so, photographs of peculiar-looking gravesites enclosed in wrought-iron cages have circulated online with captions declaring that the purpose of the cages was to prevent vampires and zombies from escaping their graves and terrorizing the living:¬†The text in the above post reads: ""This is a grave from the Victorian age when a fear of zombies and vampires was prevalent. The cage was intended to trap the undead just in case the corpse reanimated.""Interestingly enough, structures like these, called ""mortsafes,"" can indeed be found in old graveyards around the U.K., and do date from the early Victorian era. However, they were not designed to keep the ""undead"" in; they were meant to keep the living out. Grave robbing was a serious problem in the early 1800s, and these sturdy cages were one method people came up with to protect burial sites from disturbance (another was covering the graves with heavy stone slabs).¬†Mortsafes were a Scottish innovation, which is unsurprising given that Edinburgh was a major hub of anatomical study during this period and it was difficult, due to antiquated laws, for researchers to maintain a sufficient supply of medical cadavers. That, in turn, led to a thriving illegal trade popularly known as ""body snatching."" An 1896 article in The Hospital, a British medical journal, looked back on that time:¬†It is now more than sixty years since the Anatomy Act was passed, and there are probably few who remember, except as a tradition, the horrors of the preceding time, when the medical schools were supplied with subjects for dissection chiefly by men who stole corpses from the grave. These men were called body-snatchers, or, in a slang phrase, ""resurrection men."" Respect for the dead made the idea of this violation of the grave horrible to the survivors, and various means were devised to secure that the bodies of the beloved dead should remain undisturbed. The iron coffin, instead of the usual wooden one, was so intended. A heavy iron cage, called a ""mortsafe,"" was another. Mortsafes were of various kinds. Some formed almost a house of iron bars, with a locked gate to it. Others lay flat on the grave, and consisted sometimes entirely of iron, and sometimes of a border of strong masonry with iron bars on the top.The Anatomy Act of 1828 provided for the licensing of teachers of anatomy and set standards for the legal donation of bodies for dissection, effectively eliminating the market for stolen corpses.¬†"	false
1769	Coca-Cola and Nestle are negotiating with the Brazilian government to privatize the Guarani Aquifier in South America.	"In February 2018, a spate of blogs published posts pushing the idea that the Guaran√≠ Aquifer in South America was in danger of being privatized by Coca-Cola and Nestle, with little in the way of evidence.Many of the posts cite a Brazilian blog, Correido do Brasil, which reported in 2016 that the companies were negotiating for control of the aquifer, a water reserve that spans about 460,000 square miles under the surface of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Bolivia.According to that blog, a ""senior official"" at the Brazilian National Water Agency (in Portugese Ag√™ncia Nacional de √Åguas or ANA) warned that talks between the government and the two firms were ""striding forward."" The article also mentioned Nestle chairman emeritus Peter Brabeck-Letmathe's heavily-criticized 2005 remarks about water privatization.But the article did not provide any information corroborating their anonymous source's allegation.We contacted both Coca-Cola and Nestle seeking comment, and each company denied the allegations. A spokesperson for Coca-Cola's Brazilian division said in statement:Coca-Cola is not negotiating with any government of any country the exploitation of the Guaran√≠ Aquifer System.The Coca-Cola Company considers water as a precious resource for life and a universal right for the healthy development of ecosystems, communities, agriculture and commerce.Nestle's also sent a statement:We do not extract water from any part of the Guarani Aquifer in South America, including in Brazil. We have no plans to do so and neither are we discussing this matter with the Brazilian authorities. Suggestions to the contrary are incorrect.Wherever we bottle water, we conduct water resource studies and constantly monitor our withdrawals to ensure we do not negatively affect local watersheds and aquifers. We are fully committed to water stewardship and the human right to water.Meanwhile, both Correido do Brasil and the claims of corporate influence upon the aquifer have come under question from Brazilian journalists; the fact-checking site Boatos rated that claim false in both 2016 and 2018.According to Boatos, the claim also appeared an online petition in 2018 on the site Avaaz.org, asking readers to sign if they opposed the Brazilian government's concession of the aquifer to the two companies. A spokesperson for Avaaz told us in a phone interview that the petition was not generated by the organization, but was most likely created by an individual user on its platform. However, we were unable to locate the petition online in March 2018. The petition was removed, the spokesperson said, and both the person who created it and the users who signed it received a message stating that it was based on a debunked claim. Boatos also reported that after first debunking the claim the site received threats of a libel lawsuit (which never materialized), and that one of their reporters was threatened personally. Reached for comment via email, the site did not identify the party who made the threat, but called it ""an attempt to intimidate us."" Boatos also attributed the resurgence of the claim to the upcoming World Water Forum, which will be held in Brazil in March 2018.Another Brazilian fact-checking site, E-Farsas, debunked another iteration of the same claim in January 2017.¬†Natalia Viana, co-director of the non-profit journalism agency Ag√™ncia P√∫blica, which operates the fact-checking site Truco, described Correido do Brazil to us via email as ""an ultra-partisan website"" and pointed out that the site's 2016 article did not substantiate its claim."	false

860	Earthquakes, such as the ones in Turkey and Syria in February 2023, can be scientifically and accurately predicted.	"Scientists say it is possible to use data to estimate the probability of earthquakes in areas where they are known to occur, but no one has been able to make a credible prediction so far. In early February 2023, a major earthquake hit parts of Turkey and Syria, leading to a death toll of 19,000 (as of this writing) that steadily rose as rescue efforts continued. As news about the earthquake spread, so did disinformation about supposed predictions surrounding this tragedy.¬†Frank Hoogerbeets, a Dutch man claiming to be a ""researcher"" of seismic activity, stated that he had predicted this event. In a tweet he wrote: ""As I stated earlier, sooner or later this would happen in this region, similar to the years 115 and 526. These earthquakes are always preceded by critical planetary geometry, as we had on 4-5 Feb.""Hoogerbeets appears to be associated with an organization known as Solar System Geometry Survey (SSGEOS). The same organization also tweeted out a claim that there was ""Potential for stronger seismic activity in or near the purple band 1-6 days. This is an estimate. Other regions are not excluded."" The region appeared to be around India and Pakistan.¬†https://twitter.com/ssgeos/status/1619828792612257792¬†These claims of predicting earthquakes are false and have no basis in scientific fact. We debunked Hoogerbeets' claims back in 2017, and other false earthquake predictions before.¬†The United States Geological Survey (USGS) categorically states that earthquakes have never been predicted before. Their website says, ""Neither the USGS nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake. We do not know how, and we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future. USGS scientists can only calculate the probability that a significant earthquake will occur (shown on our hazard mapping) in a specific area within a certain number of years.""They point out that any predictions must define three elements: "" 1) the date and time, 2) the location, and 3) the magnitude.""¬†Hoogerberts' claim that the earthquake was predicted from ""critical planetary geometry"" is contradicted by the USGS' major criteria. They state that ""earthquakes have nothing to do with clouds, bodily aches and pains, or slugs"" and rely only on ""scientific evidence.""¬†¬†The role of planetary alignments in earthquakes has long been rebuffed by scientists. Back in 2017, we spoke to¬†Andrew Michael, a geophysicist with USGS, who said in a statement to Snopes that¬†alignment-based predictions are ""easy to refute."" He told us:Seismologists have spent a lot of time searching for the effect of lunar tides on earthquakes. While the lunar tides are easy to observe in the oceans and even in the deformation of the solid earth, finding their impact on earthquakes requires the statistical analysis of large data sets in order to find a small effect. Even then the results are controversial due to disputes over the statistical methods and how to handle the statistical impacts of earthquake clustering such as aftershocks. Overall, the moon doesn't have a large enough effect on earthquakes to be used for forecasting.Now we turn to the gravitational forces of the planets. The force is proportional to the mass of the first body times the mass of the second body divided by the square of the distance between them. The earth's mass is a constant and so we can easily compute the relative gravitational force of the other planets by knowing their masses and distances from earth. Jupiter, at its closest approach, has almost 1% of the moon's gravitational attraction, Venus comes in next at 0.6%, and the other planets are less. If we can barely observe the affect of the Moon on earthquakes then it isn't believable that we could observe the impact of the other planets.But this researcher doesn't mention tides or gravity. He discusses resonances. In astronomy orbital resonances are due to gravity and so my discussion applies. However, it could be that he means something else. If that is the case, then the prediction may fall beyond the boundaries of science and my ability to comment.Many of Hoogerbeets' claims also fall into a pattern that manages to be both specific and general at the same time, something USGS argues is common in alleged quake predictions. For example in this particular tweet, SSGEOS claims a broad swath of land will see an earthquake within a specific range of time (""1-4 days""), while adding, ""This is an estimate. Other regions not excluded."" Excluding other regions opens up the prediction to even more interpretation and allows someone to claim being correct just with an estimate.¬†This falls into the pattern described by USGS as ""so general that there will always be an earthquake that fits; such as, (a) There will be a M4 earthquake somewhere in the U.S. in the next 30 days. (b) There will be a M2 earthquake on the west coast of the U.S. today.""¬†Susan Hough, a seismologist in the Earthquake Hazards Program at USGS, told NPR that Hoogerbeets' claims are attempts to gain attention for ""scattershot statements and predictions"" that seem to have been borne out. ""So, yeah, it's the stopped clock that's right twice a day, basically,"" she said.This is not to say that one cannot estimate the probability of earthquakes occurring in specific areas, and then preparing for them. The area in Turkey is the site of frequent seismic activity, where three tectonic plates converge.¬†""Turkey's a known earthquake zone. We've known about these faults, we know earthquakes this size are possible,"" Hough added. She emphasized that the need is for preparedness, and not to focus on predictions.""One of my colleagues told me years ago that we can predict earthquakes to the extent that we need to,"" she told NPR. ""We know they're going to happen, and we know that certain parts of the world are going to be exposed to them and that we just need to build the environment accordingly.""¬†The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN), operated by the University of Washington and University of Oregon, detailed past attempts to predict earthquakes:Along the San Andreas Fault, an earthquake prediction was made in the 1980s for the segment near Parkfield CA considered likely to rupture. Earlier this century it produced a series of identical earthquakes (about M 6.0) at fairly regular time intervals. Using a set of assumptions about fault mechanics and the rate of stress accumulation, the USGS predicted that a Parkfield earthquake of about M 6.0 earthquake would occur between 1988 and 1992. USGS scientists monitored Parkfield for a wide variety of possible precursory effects, but the predicted earthquake did not materialize until 2004, long after the prediction window expired. ""Capturing"" the magnitude 6.0 Parkfield earthquake in a dense network of instrumentation was a significant accomplishment, providing data to determine whether precursory effects exist (none were found), and give new insights on the mechanics of fault rupture More from the USGS...More from CISN.The network even mentioned the most successful example of a ""prediction,"" in China:One well-known successful earthquake prediction was for the Haicheng, China earthquake of 1975, when an evacuation warning was issued the day before an M 7.3 earthquake. In the preceding months changes in land elevation and in ground water levels, widespread reports of peculiar animal behavior, and many foreshocks had led to a lower-level warning. An increase in foreshock activity triggered the evacuation warning. Unfortunately, most earthquakes do not have such obvious precursors. In spite of their success in 1975, there was no warning of the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, magnitude 7.6, which caused an estimated 250,000 fatalities.The group¬†added, ""Predictions claimed as 'successes' may rely on a restatement of well-understood long-term geologic earthquake hazards, or be so broad and vague that they are fulfilled by typical background seismic activity.""Scientists have found some ways to give people warnings. USGS has built a system called ShakeAlert that sends a notification to a person's phone and provides 20 seconds to a minute advance notice before an earthquake occurs. The technology uses data gathered from USGS field station sensors that can measure the intensity of the ground shaking.¬†But how does one measure the probability of massive seismic disruptions? According to Franklin Wolfe, a researcher at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University:Timing is the most difficult challenge in the game of earthquake prediction. In fact, two of the theories that inform our (best) predictions could be flawed. The first theory is called Elastic Rebound Theory, which states that the Earth's crust will bend and deform under intense stress until, eventually, it breaks under the strain. Slippage along the break (i.e., an earthquake) allows the rock on each side to rebound to a less deformed state and release the stored energy, allowing the process of accumulating strain to begin anew. The second theory is called the Characteristic Earthquake, which describes how the most studied earthquake-generating faults seem to have distinct segments. These segments repeatedly rupture to produce earthquakes of similar magnitudes after accumulating a similar amount of strain in the intervening period between earthquake events. Assuming these two theories always held, you could predict when the next earthquake would happen based on 1) the location of greatest unrelieved strain, 2) the time since the last earthquake on the fault, and 3) precise knowledge of the fault zone (which we may never achieve for many areas).Tim Wright of the U.K.-based Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET) told Al Jazeera that after a large earthquake, a lot of data can be collected and deciphered, and some of it is useful. ""We can make calculations about places that are more or less likely to have earthquakes as a result of [another],"" he said.¬†¬†Wright was awaiting data from a European satellite that will pass over southern Turkey after the 2023 earthquake to figure out how strain builds at known faults, to calculate how much energy could be released in a specific area, and the rate at which it would be released. Even with that information, scientists don't know when the next earthquake could be. ""We don't know whether it could be a single magnitude 8 earthquake or ten magnitude 7 earthquakes,"" he said.¬†Michel Bruneau, a professor at the University at Buffalo and earthquake engineering expert, told the Associated Press, ""You can still do averages. You can still run statistics. [...] You can say, what's the return period between small, medium and large earthquakes, and then run statistical analysis through all of that.""¬†""Scientists have tried every possible method to try to predict earthquakes. [...] Nobody has been able to crack it and make a credible prediction,"" he added.¬†"	false
4968	A photograph shows President Donald Trump's thinning hair blowing in the wind.	"U.S. President Donald Trump's hair has been a subject of debate for decades. While there is photographic and video evidence that the president's hair may not be as full as it once was (he is, by the way, 73 years old), we've also encountered quite a few fake photographs that purported to show Trump as nearly bald.In August 2019, we encountered yet another example of follicle fakery. A picture supposedly showing Trump's badly thinning hair blowing in the wind was posted to Reddit and Imgur, along with a caption that apparently tried to push the picture into viral infamy via the so-called Streisand Effect: ""Donald Trump wants this picture removed from the internet. DON'T SHARE IT!""This is not a genuine photograph of Trump, and the president has not made any public comments about having this image removed from the internet.¬†This manipulated picture is based on of a genuine photograph of Trump snapped as he boarded Air Force One.

5547	All the Congressional Democrats voted against a 2.8 percent Social Security cost of living allowance.	"In mid-October 2018, Facebook users shared an inaccurate meme asking ""Were any of you aware that ALL the Democrats voted AGAINST the 2.8% Social Security cost of living increase?"":¬†No Democrats, or any other legislators for that matter, voted for or against the 2.8 percent cost of living allowance (COLA) increase that Social Security recipients will see beginning in 2019. Since 1975, COLA increases have kicked in automatically and are based on changes in the consumer price index, a figure calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Here's how the Social Security Administration has summarized the history of COLA increases:Most people are aware that there are annual increases in Social Security benefits to offset the corrosive effects of inflation on fixed incomes. These increases, now known as Cost of Living Allowances (COLAs), are such an accepted feature of the program that it is difficult to imagine a time when there were no COLAs. But in fact, when Ida May Fuller received her first $22.54 benefit payment in January of 1940, this would be the same amount she would receive each month for the next 10 years. For Ida May Fuller, and the millions of other Social Security beneficiaries like her, the amount of that first benefit check was the amount they could expect to receive for life. It was not until the 1950 Amendments that Congress first legislated an increase in benefits. Current beneficiaries had their payments recomputed and Ida May Fuller, for example, saw her monthly check increase from $22.54 to $41.30.These recomputations were effective for September 1950 and appeared for the first time in the October 1950 checks. A second increase was legislated for September 1952. Together these two increases almost doubled the value of Social Security benefits for existing beneficiaries. From that point on, benefits were increased only when Congress enacted special legislation for that purpose.In 1972 legislation the law was changed to provide, beginning in 1975, for automatic annual cost-of-living allowances (i.e., COLAs) based on the annual increase in consumer prices. No longer do beneficiaries have to await a special act of Congress to receive a benefit increase and no longer does inflation drain value from Social Security benefits."	false
4494	A viral photograph showing a canine coronavirus vaccine demonstrates that there should already exist a human vaccine for COVID-19.

In spring 2020, Facebook users circulated a post with a photograph of a small bottle labeled ""canine coronavirus vaccine,"" suggesting that the vaccine should have been available to combat the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic in humans.""Now this was 2001 tell me why 19 years later they say there is no vaccine,"" reads part of the original post, which appears to have been deleted or removed from public viewing.Sharing that picture and its caption, another user posted: ""Canine vaccine for dogs and not humans? ... STAY WOKE PEOPLE!!""But as of May 4, no vaccine currently exists for SARS-CoV-2, which is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has killed hundreds of thousands of people globally, and prompted government-imposed lockdowns in 2020. And a vaccine to fight coronaviruses that have infected dogs won't work on COVID-19 in humans.The confusion seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the word ""coronavirus,"" which actually refers to a family of hundreds of viruses, not just one type of sickness. Politicians and journalists frequently ‚Äî and misleadingly ‚Äî used the term in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the novel coronavirus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.But the reality is this: Most of us will catch at least one type of coronavirus in our lifetime and suffer cold-like symptoms while others may suffer more severe and sometimes fatal infections, including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Listing all of the types of coronaviruses that can cause disease in humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states:Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. There are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. [There are] seven coronaviruses that can infect people [‚Ä¶].One of the seven is SARS-CoV-2 ‚Äî the strain for which epidemiologists are scrambling to create a vaccine to end the 2019-2020 global health crisis.Meanwhile, some types of coronaviruses cause illness in animals, including cattle, camels, cats, and dogs. Of that type, some remain exclusively in the animal world, while others ‚Äî on rare occasions ‚Äî mutate in such a way that allows them to infect humans, according to the CDC. That was the case with the COVID-19 outbreak, though scientists have yet to pinpoint the exact source of the virus as of this writing.The popular Facebook photo does show a real vaccine used to help dogs fight a specific strain of coronavirus unique to that species. The type of shot, however, is not effective in humans and will not help scientists fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.The vaccine, called Nobivac Canine 1-Cv, is ""designed to enhance the immune response and offer protection against canine coronavirus,"" according to Merck Animal Health, which is the manufacturer of the vaccine. The product is ""approved for the vaccination of healthy dogs as an aid in the prevention of disease caused by canine coronavirus infection,"" which can cause intestinal and respiratory sickness.The manufacturer's website also states canine coronaviruses ""are not the same virus as SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for causing the COVID-19 infection"" ‚Äî the same web page includes an image of a product that looks similar to the one featured in the viral Facebook post.Although government officials and the news media often referred to the virus at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic as simply ""coronavirus"" in the early days of the outbreak, scientists have urged the use of a more accurate name. According to the World Health Organization, the virus is called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease it causes is referred to as COVID-19.¬†"	false
1345	Drinking four glasses of water at the beginning of each day will prevent heart attacks and cure various diseases.	"A missive touting a regimen that calls for the ingestion of four glasses of water first thing in the morning, followed by the restriction of drinking after meals, began circulating on the internet in August 2004. While it now arrives primarily labeled, ""Heart Attacks and Water,"" its earliest appearances were titled, ""Drinking Water as Treatment"" and ""Drink Water on Empty Stomach"":It is popular in Japan today to drink water immediately after waking up every morning. Furthermore, scientific tests have proven its value. We publish below a description of use of water for our readers.For old and serious diseases as well as modern illnesses the water treatment had been found successful by a Japanese medical society as a hundred percent cure for the following diseases, Headache, body ache, heart system, arthritis, fast heart beat, epilepsy, excess fatness, bronchitis, asthma, TB, Meningtitis, Kidney and Urine diseases, vomiting gastritis, diarrhoea, piles, diabetes, constipation, all eye diseases, womb cancer and menstrual disorders, ear nose and throat diseases.METHOD OF TREATMENT1. As you wake up in the morning before brushing teeth, drink four glasses of water each of 160 ml.2. Brush and clean the mouth but do not eat or drink anything for 45 minutes.3. After 45 minutes you may eat and drink as normal.4. After 15 minutes of breakfast, lunch and dinner do not eat or drink anything for two hours.5. Those who are old or sick and are unable to drink four glasses of water at the beginning may commence by taking little water and gradually increase it to four glasses per day.6. The above method of treatment will cure diseases of the sick and others can enjoy a healthy life.The following list gives the number of days of treatment required to cure main diseases.1. High Blood Pressure 30 days2. Gastric 10 days3. Diabetes 30 days4. Constipation 10 days5. Cancer 180 days6. TB 90 daysArthritis patients should follow the above treatment for only 3 days in the first week to be followed by daily treatment. This treatment method has no side effects, however at the commencement of treatment you may have to urinate a few times.Our earliest sighting of this item came from a message board post, where it was presented without any comment identifying its author. Its central claims to authority, that ""scientific tests have proven its value"" and ""water treatment had been found successful by a Japanese medical society as a hundred percent cure for [various diseases]"" are unsupported; We were unable to locate any record of ""scientific tests"" proving this hypothesis, nor of statements issued in support of it by a ""Japanese medical society.""Diabetes, cancer, and tuberculosis are serious illnesses that are not subject to being easily cured by even the latest medical technologies, let alone by tap water. Belief in such easy fixes is understandable because such diseases are big, mean, scary things, and those so afflicted often feel powerless in the face of them.Of the illnesses included on the proffered list, the only malady that might be improved by increasing one's daily water intake is constipation; however, even that claim may be nothing more than chimera. The National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse says, of the practice of increasing fluid intake in an effort to treat constipation, that:Research shows that although increased fluid intake does not necessarily help relieve constipation, many people report some relief from their constipation if they drink fluids such as water and juice and avoid dehydration. Liquids add fluid to the colon and bulk to stools, making bowel movements softer and easier to pass.Claims that certain healthful benefits can be gained by eating or drinking particular items at specified times of the day are not new; for example, the ""eat fruit only on an empty stomach"" rumor has circulated for years. Likewise, the belief that increasing one's water intake would be a good and healthful thing to do is also well traveled; many people continue to believe (erroneously, it turns out) that 75% of Americans are ""chronically dehydrated"" and that, to stay healthy, folks must drink eight glasses of water a day.In July 2007, the following admonition against drinking cold water was tacked on to the basic e-mail about timing one's water intake:This makes sense ‚Äî the Chinese and Japanese drink hot tea with their meals, not cold water. maybe it is time we adopt their drinking habit while eating!!! Nothing to lose, everything to gain.""For those who like to drink cold water, this article is applicable to you. It is nice to have a cup of cold drink after a meal. However, the cold water will solidify the oily stuff that you have just consumed. It will slow down the digestion. Once this ‚Äúsludge‚Äù reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. It will line the intestine. Very soon, this will turn into fats and lead to cancer. It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal.A serious note about heart attacks: Women should know that not every heart attack symptom is going to be the left arm hurting. Be aware of intense pain in the jaw line. You may never have the first chest pain during the course of a heart attack. Nausea and intense sweating are also common symptoms.60% of people who have a heart attack while they are asleep do not wake up. Pain in the jaw can wake you from a sound sleep.

I just did!!!As we detail in a seperate article about an email supposedly outlining the ""dangers of drinking cold water,"" that rumor itself dates to February 2006. By July 2006, it was circulating as the lead-in to a ""cough CPR"" mailing (which dangerously advocates that medically-unsupervised heart attack victims attempt to cough rhythmically to get themselves through cardiac events), and, by October 2006, had come to have the following bit about heart attacks in women added to it:A serious note about heart attacks:Women should know that not every heart attack symptom is going to be the left arm hurting. Be aware of intense pain in the jaw line.You may never have the first chest pain during the course of a heart attack.Nausea and intense sweating are also common symptoms.60% of people who have a heart attack while they are asleep do not wake up.Pain in the jaw can wake you from a sound sleep. Let‚Äôs be careful and be aware. The more we know, the better chance we could survive‚Ä¶A cardiologist says if everyone who gets this mail sends it to 10 people, you can be sure that we‚Äôll save at least one life.We discuss these claims in depth in our article about heart attack symptoms, but, in a nutshell, while it is true that a number of the signs are subtle and can easily be mistaken for indigestion, it's not true that women have one sort of heart attack and men another.In January 2010, we happened upon another ""benefits of drinking water"" e-mail, which, by November 2011, had been expanded into this longer form:Drinking water at the correct time maximizes its effectiveness on the Human body:2 glasses of water after waking up helps activate internal organs1 glass of water 30 minutes before a meal ‚Äì helps digestion1 glass of water before taking a bath ‚Äì helps lower blood pressure1 glass of water before going to bed ‚Äì avoids stroke or heart attackHeart Attack & WaterI asked my Doctor why do I and other people urinate (pee) so much at night time. Answer from my Cardiac Doctor = Gravity holds water in the lower part of your body when you are upright. When you lie down and the lower body (legs and other things) seeks level with the kidneys it is then that the kidneys remove the water because it is easier. This then ties in with the last statement!I knew you need your minimum water to help flush the toxins out of your body, but this was news to me.Correct time to drink water... very Important.From A Cardiac Specialist!Drinking water at a certain time maximizes its effectiveness on the body:2 glasses of water after waking up - helps activate internal organs1 glass of water 30 minutes before a meal - helps digestion1 glass of water before taking a bath - helps lower blood pressure1 glass of water before going to bed - avoids stroke or heart attackPlease pass this to the people you care about......I can also add to this... My Physician told me that water at bed time will also help prevent night time leg cramps. Your leg muscles are seeking hydration when they cramp and wake you up with a Charlie Horse.The suggestion that a glass of water ""helps digestion"" is nebulous (how would that be measured?), the claim that it ""helps lower blood pressure"" is erroneous, and the statement that water ""activates internal organs"" in the morning is misleading (our organs function quite well all on their own while we sleep, and they continue functioning after we wake up). The one potentially true bit of information related to this item is that some studies have suggested a higher daily intake of water may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease."	false

2031	A semi-truck spilled sex toys on a highway in Oklahoma City after rolling over from a crash with a box truck.	"On Sept. 14, 2022, KWTV News 9 helicopter pilot Jim Gardner reported from the air about a crash involving a semi-truck and a box truck. Gardner said the incident ended with no injuries and occurred on the eastbound route of interstate 40 near an on-ramp in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. According to reports, the tractor-trailer truck spilled adult products that appeared to be sex toys such as dildos or vibrators, as well as liquid items, possibly lubricant, all over the road when it overturned. Here's what we found in our research.First, Oklahoma Highway Patrol tweeted about the crash on the morning that it happened. However, the tweet did not say what kinds of products were strewn all over the road:TheLostOgle.com was first to report that the semi-truck was carrying sex toys, claiming that it had ""spilled a load of dildos and lube."" The blog reposted coverage from the SkyNews 9 helicopter:We did some digging around and confirmed with Oklahoma Highway Safety that the semi-truck belonged to HDR Transport out of Garden Grove, California. By phone, the company only confirmed to us that the truck was carrying a product that functioned as ""a liquid to clean the sex toys."" However, they said they didn't have any further information on other products that were being transported.However, Vice.com's Jason Koebler reported that he and Motherboard executive editor Emanuel Maiberg were able to track down what they believed to be one of the products that was visible from Gardner's helicopter shot. Several containers strewn all over the road appeared to show the front and back sides of several boxes of a product called Adam & Eve G-Spot Touch Finger Vibe.The Vice story cited pictures of the vibrator's white box from a review on the Kinky Vibes YouTube channel.

1866	Scientific studies demonstrate that the process of adding fluoride to public water reduces the IQ of the individuals in those areas.	Beginning in the mid-1940s, cities in the United States began adding low concentrations of fluoride to public water supplies in an effort prevent tooth decay. As of 2014, 74.4 percent of the United States populace has access to water from a fluoridated source, and this practice is employed by countries and cities all around the world.According to numerous meta-studies, the addition of fluoride (the ionic form of the element fluorine that plays a role in tissue mineralization) to public drinking water significantly reduces the incidence of dental caries.Moderate voices against the practice of water fluoridation point to concerns over the possible negative health effects of fluoride consumption, and a perceived lack of efficacy in terms of dental benefits. More rabid voices, like those of the ever-imaginative Joseph Mercola and Alex Jones, allege widespread conspiracies invoking its (nonexistent) origins in Nazi concentration camps and its use as genocidal chemical weapon employed by the heavy-handed arm of the United States federal government, per Jones‚Äô Infowars.com:Fluoride, in whatever amount, is nothing less than a chemical weapon. Considering it is applied to entire populations or certain groups within a population, the definition is chemical warfare- a tool most useful to eugenicists who are intent on depopulation [sic] the planet.These combined efforts have produced myriad confused and self-referential claims that would require multiple posts to debunk. In this particular post, however, we will focus only on the claim that scientific studies have demonstrated that intentional water fluoridation causes neurological damage resulting in a negative effect on a person‚Äôs intelligence quotient.That claim, which is based on an either willful or negligent misreading of actual science, is effectively illustrated in this¬†statement by Joseph Mercola (emphasis ours):At present [December 2014], a total of 42 human studies have linked¬†moderately high fluoride exposures with reduced intelligence, and over 100 animal studies have shown that fluoride exposure can cause brain damage.The claim that studies have ‚Äúlinked‚Äù fluoride to reduced intelligence is a textbook-ready case of bait-and-switch. In Mercola‚Äôs (and many others‚Äô) language, the topic has surreptitiously been shifted from the act of water fluoridation as a public health measure to the broader concept of fluoride toxicity in children. Many otherwise benign chemicals can also be harmful in high concentrations. Thiocyanate, a chemical found in¬†kale, may kill you at high doses, for example.The most famous and commonly cited study (partially because the anti-fluoridation group Fluoride Action Now issued a misleading press release about it that was incorrectly¬†covered as a Reuters report by a number of newspapers) used to link fluoride to reduced IQ was published by a team of Harvard researchers. This¬†paper, a meta-analysis of previously conducted studies that compared populations of children exposed to various levels of naturally occurring fluoride in their water, concluded:Findings from our meta-analyses of 27 studies published over 22 years suggest an inverse association between high fluoride exposure and children‚Äôs intelligence. Children who lived in areas with high fluoride exposure had lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-exposure or control areas.Scale and context, which are so often ignored by the evangelists of pseudoscience, are crucial when interpreting the results of this analysis, however.First, the issue of scale. As neuroscientist Steven Novella pointed out in his Neurologica blog, most of these studies‚Äô ‚Äúhigh fluoride‚Äù groups used concentrations many times higher than allowable limits in the United States, and many of the control groups or ‚Äúlow fluoride‚Äù groups had concentrations in the range that is actually targeted as optimal by water fluoridation regulations:There was a lot of variability across the studies, but generally the high fluoride groups were in the 2-10 mg/L range, while the reference low fluoride groups were in the 0.5-1.0 mg/L range [...]In other words ‚Äì fluoridated water in the US has the same level of fluoride as the control or low fluoride groups in the China studies reviewed in the recent article, and the negative association with IQ was only found where fluoride levels were much higher ‚Äì generally above EPA limits.Currently, the EPA‚Äôs maximum allowable¬†limit for fluoride in drinking water is 4 mg/L with a voluntary recommendation of 2 mg/L. When fluoride is added to a public water supply, the target concentration is 0.7 mg/L.Supporters of the notion that this Harvard paper‚Äôs collection of studies still suggests developmental risks of fluoridation at levels used in public health programs might argue that eight of the studies analyzed in the meta-review focused on concentrations allegedly within this allowable range. This is a factual point that deserves further investigation, as a close look at these eight studies reveals that their contribution to the fluoridation debate is dubious at best.Of those eight studies, half of them co-investigated fluoride and iodine together (Lin et al 1991, Xu et al 1994, Yang et al 1994, Hong et al 2001) making it hard or in some cases impossible to separate out the combined effects, and two of those four studies reached conclusions that are counter to the hypothesis that fluoridation levels alone are the main driver of a lower IQ:Xu et al 1994:When it comes to the parents' level of education, and the children's exposure (or lack thereof) to pre-school education, sIgnificant differences in the intelligence level in the young subjects are shown in both regions affected by thyroid swelling, and their comparative regions. This demonstrates that levels of IQ are not only affected by the amount of trace elements in the environment, but also by social factors such as the education of the subjects, the type of education. and training they are exposed to, etc These social factors most definitely play an important role in this type of research.Hong et al 2001:The IQ results of this study show no significant difference between the average IQs of those children from the high fluoride only areas and the high fluoride/high iodine areas, however the result from the high fluoride/low iodine group show statistically significant differences as compared to that of the low fluoride/low iodine group. In short, it appears that the presence or lack of iodine is a more significant factor in both the prevalence of goiter and average IQ [than fluoride levels alone].Among the eight studies, two of them (Yao et al 1997, Seraj et al 2006) do not appear to actually measure the water intake of the regions in which they are observing differences in intelligence quotient,¬†or at the very least they do not report the total range of values for each region, or any statistical information regarding those values.Two of those eight studies use a control group with fluoride values that are literally the same or higher than the target range of fluoridation efforts in the United States (Xu et al 1994, Hong et al 2001), seemingly ceding the point that those levels do not affect children‚Äôs IQ.Finally, four of these eight papers (Yang et al 1994, Lu et al 2000, Hong et al 2001, Xiang et al 2003a) are either published (or republished) in the allegedly peer-reviewed journal Fluoride, a publication of the ‚ÄúInternational Society for Fluoride Research Inc.‚Äù ‚Äî an anti-fluoridation group whose editor-in-chief is a psychiatrist in private practice, with no academic background on the topic of fluoride toxicity.Collectively, this demonstrates that most of the IQ variance presented in the Harvard study still stems from exposures to extremely high levels of fluoride that would already be considered dangerous in the US, and those studies finding effects on a smaller scale are not sufficient to demonstrate the effects those groups opposed to fluoridation claim they demonstrate.The next issue is context. Literally none of the studies involved tested populations of individuals exposed to drinking water that was artificially supplemented with fluoride as a public health measure. Instead, all of the studies come from China or Iran, both of which have areas of naturally occurring (endemic) high fluoride pockets of groundwater.That means that studies utilized in its analysis are wholly irrelevant to the question that advocates claim they are answering. This is significant, as the use of these very specific studies introduces a veritable Homerian epic of confounding details, some of which came up in our analysis of the eight low-level fluoride studies discussed above. Among the most pressing of these are a lack of information on other confounding variables and the quality of the studies they utilized. These issues are noted by the authors of the Harvard study themselves:‚ÄúMost reports were fairly brief and complete information on covariates was not available‚Äù‚ÄúDrinking water may contain other neurotoxicants, such as arsenic‚Äù‚ÄúThe studies [used in the meta-analysis] were generally of insufficient quality‚ÄùThe authors also explicitly¬†state that the results cannot be used to estimate the possible limits of fluoride exposure with respect to developmental damage, due to lack of data:Our review cannot be used to derive an exposure limit, because the actual exposures of the individual children are not known.The data could also be complicated by other factors not accounted for, they say, including the notion that the populations of individuals compared may not actually¬†reflect their fluoride intake:Misclassification of children in both high- and low-exposure groups may have occurred if the children were drinking water from other sources [...]Regarding the other neurotoxins that could be in the water, the authors of the Harvard Study make the (unsourced) claim that it is unlikely that other neurotoxicants are present in the groundwater of the areas their studies investigated. As many of the studies did not measure for other compounds, it is impossible to be sure in these specific cases; however,¬†geochemists are not convinced that the same natural processes that lead to high fluoride concentrations don‚Äôt also yield high concentrations of other dangerous metals.Research has, for example, shown that there is a strong correlation between arsenic and fluoride in drinking water, according to¬†a 2011¬†study in Applied Geochemistry analyzing groundwater in Yuncheng Basin, China:The strong positive correlation between groundwater F/Cl and As/Cl ratios (r2 = 0.98 and 0.77 in shallow and deep groundwater, respectively) indicates that these elements are mobilized and enriched by common processes.This should not function as a distraction from the larger point that studying naturally occurring pockets of high fluoride and the assessing the risks of supplementing public drinking water in an effort to have it reach a concentration of 0.7 mg/L are two completely different beasts.You might ask if any studies have been completed specifically on the effects of IQ on artificially enhanced drinking water. The most recent analysis of these studies comes from an 2015 evidence¬†review performed by the government of Ireland‚Äôs Health Research Board, which found only one study sufficient to test that hypothesis:There was only one study carried out in a non-endemic or CWF [community water fluoridation] area that examined fluoride and IQ. This was a prospective cohort study (whose design is appropriate to infer causality) in New Zealand. The study concluded that there was no evidence of a detrimental effect on IQ as a result of exposure to CWF.For these reasons, the claim that there are scientific studies that support the notion that water fluoridation can cause developmental problems in children that result in lower IQs is false. No studies that actually investigate that specific question have reached that conclusion. Studies that have been used to make that argument are weak and rely on data collected that does not directly address those questions in the first place.¬†Update:¬†On 19 September 2017, the journal Environmental Health Perspectives published a study (‚ÄúPrenatal Fluoride Exposure and Cognitive Outcomes in Children at 4 and 6‚Äì12 Years of Age in Mexico‚Äù) that found an association between prenatal exposure to fluoride and reduced IQ in mother-offspring pairs in Mexico.	false

2072	Low water levels in Texas revealed 113-million-year-old dinosaur tracks.	Many of the dinosaur tracks are in the riverbed of the Paluxy River, a Texas waterway that generally stops flowing during the summer months. While many of the tracks are visible every year due to low water conditions, severe drought in 2022 unveiled a new set of tracks seen for what is thought to be the first time. Low water levels around the world have revealed artifacts previously thought long gone in the history books, from sunken ships in Europe and Chinese Buddhist statues to a barrel containing a body in Nevada and so-called ‚Äúhunger stones‚Äù found in the Czech Republic. In August 2022, a state park in Texas joined the ranks when 113-million-year-old dinosaur tracks imprinted on a riverbed were revealed.A video posted to Facebook on Aug. 17, 2022, by a nonprofit group that supports Dinosaur Valley State Park in Texas showed ‚Äúhuge dinosaur tracks‚Äù in the Paluxy River.‚ÄúNormally. These are under water and mud,‚Äù wrote the group in a caption accompanying the video.During the summer months, the Paluxy River normally stops flowing, leaves only isolated pools, notes the park, so revealing dinosaur tracks is not uncommon.But recent drought conditions in Texas published by the U.S. Drought Monitor showed that as of this writing, nearly the entire state is in some form of drought, affecting more than 22 million people. The tracks publicized widely in 2022 are normally under water throughout the year, park spokesperson Kirk McDonnell told Snopes in an email.‚ÄúDue to the excessive drought conditions this past summer, the river dried up completely in most locations, allowing for more tracks to be uncovered here in the park. Under normal river conditions, these newer tracks are under water and are commonly filled in with sediment, making them buried and not as visible,‚Äù said McDonnell.‚ÄúPark Rangers at Dinosaur Valley State Park do want to point out that the conditions to view the dinosaur tracks depends on how much rain the area receives. With rain in the upcoming forecasts, it is anticipated that the tracks uncovered during the drought will soon be buried again. Tracks being buried under layers of sediment do help protect them from natural weathering and erosion.‚ÄùDinosaurs left tracks in the mud along what used to be an ancient ocean, according to Dinosaur Valley State Park. ‚ÄúAround 113 million years ago, this area was at the edge of an advancing and retreating sea,‚Äù notes the park.‚ÄúCalcium carbonate deposits from the shells of crustaceans (crabs, etc.) that lived in the sea formed a limey mud. That mud had the perfect consistency ‚Äî not too wet, not too stiff ‚Äî to preserve tracks.‚ÄùThen over a century ago, hundreds of theropod tracks were found in the Glen Rose area, a short drive from Fort Worth.In 1909, a boy named George Adams found ‚Äústrange three-toed tracks‚Äù belonging to a species called theropod in the limestone bed of the river, which experts think may have been revealed during a ‚Äúmighty flood‚Äù the year before. Then in 1937, dinosaur hunter R.T. Bird was collecting fossils for the American Museum of Natural History when he found a ‚Äúnear-perfect trackway of multiple steps of multiple animals, both sauropods and theropods.‚Äù Bird‚Äôs discovery marked the first ever distinct sauropod tracks found and helped scientists to develop a better understanding of dinosaur habitats and behaviors.‚ÄúThe majority of Dinosaur Tracks at Dinosaur Valley State Park belong to two different species: a theropod called Acrocanthosaurus and a sauropod called Sauroposeidon. The dinosaur tracks in the park date back to 113 million years ago,‚Äù McDonnell told Snopes.‚ÄúMost tracks that have recently been uncovered and discovered at different parts of the river in the park belong to Acrocanthosaurus. This was a dinosaur that would stand, as an adult, about 15 feet tall and weight close to seven tons. Sauroposeidon, the other species that left tracks behind, would be about 60 feet tall and weigh about 44 tons as an adult.‚ÄùSeasonal rains during the fall and winter will likely cover the tracks once again.Sources| U.S. Drought Monitor. https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?TX.

265	Photographs capture the archeological discovery of skeletal remains of giant humanoids.	"A collection of photographs purportedly showing the remains of giant humanoids, dubbed the ""Canaan"" or ""Nephilim"" skeletons, have been making the internet round since as far back as 2004:The images were assembled from various individual hoaxes that presented them with varying back stories sourcing them to recent archeological discoveries in the Mediterranean (e.g., Greece), the Middle East (e.g., Iran, Saudi Arabia), or India, and tying them to Biblical accounts of giants:This is my first time seeing this even hearing about it. A long time friend of mine sent it today. The best I can tell is that it is the area of the Greek Hellenistic influence around the time when Alexander The Great died in 323 BC. When David slew Goliath of Gath, he was reported to be a Philistine. The Bible isn't detailed except to say Goliath had 4 kinsmen and maybe these are some of his kinsmen or countrymen as mentioned, rather than just a big Philistines.giants from the days of the bible ...I thought this was really cool, how scientist keep finding proof of biblical stories!Remember the old testament story of how the Israelites were afraid because of the GIANTS in the land of Canaan.Numbers 13:33 ""There we saw the GIANTS (the descendants of Anak came from the GIANTS); and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.""These photos are from a recent archialogical [sic] dig in Greece. They discovered the skeletal remains of these giants that prove the Bible true.Of course, none of these supposedly remarkable archeological discoveries has ever found its way into a museum or the pages of a scientific journal. Like multiple other instances of giant skeleton and skull photographs, these images are all digital manipulations, often ones created for Photoshop contests hosted by various websites.The two pictures on the right-hand side of the top row, for example, are manipulated photographs of a 1993 University of Chicago dinosaur dig in Niger to which someone has added an image of a giant skull. No such skull appears in the original photographs:In a 2007 article, National Geographic offered an account from the creator of a similar ""giant skeleton"" hoax photograph:IronKite started with an aerial photo of a mastodon excavation in Hyde Park, New York, in 2000. He then digitally superimposed a human skeleton over the beast's remains.The later addition of a digging man presented the biggest technical challenge.""If you look, he's holding a yellow-handled shovel, but there's nothing on the end,"" IronKite said.""Originally, the spade end was there. But [it] looked like it was occupying the exact same space as the skeleton's temple, making the whole thing look fake.""Now it looks like he's just holding a stick, and people don't notice. It's funny.""IronKite also altered the color of the man's clothing to create a ""uniform tie-in"" with the white-shirted observer peering down from the wooden platform.The two figures work to exaggerate the scale of the skeleton, he added.IronKite said he's tickled that the picture -- which took only about an hour and a half to create -- has generated so much Internet attention.""I laugh myself silly when some guy claims to know someone who was there, or even goes so far as to claim that he or she was there when they found the skeleton and took the picture,"" IronKite said.""Sometimes people seem so desperate to believe in something that they lie to themselves, or exaggerate in order to make their own argument stronger.""As we frequently point out, we don't need to know the specific origins of all of these photographs to definitively determine that they're fakes. The square-cube law makes it a physical impossibility that humanoids of the size and proportions represented by these bones could ever have existed:"	false
1150	Tax records show that Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker declared Texas as his principal residence even after he began his run for office.	"Walker took a tax break on a Texas property reserved for ""principal"" residences, but this fact does not automatically establish a lack of the Georgia residency required for Walker to run for office in that state. On November 23, 2022, CNN's KFile reported that Georgia U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker ""took [a] tax break in 2021 and 2022 for his Texas home even after launching a bid for Senate in Georgia.""At issue is a tax break known as the homestead exemption. Under Texas law, a homeowner may apply for a homestead exemption, which removes a portion of a home's value from taxation if the property is declared to be the applicant's ""principal residence.""¬†Walker has lived in Texas for decades. To qualify for a homestead exemption in Texas, among other requirements, the home must have been the owner's principal residence ""on Jan. 1 of the tax year."" Temporary exceptions can apply. For example, according to the Texas Comptroller's Office, ""you may continue to receive the exemption if you do not establish a principal residence elsewhere, you intend to return to the home, and you are away less than two years.""¬†Walker and his wife, Julie Blanchard, have historically spent most of their time in Texas. Blanchard voted in Georgia with an absentee ballot sent to Walker's Texas home in the 2020 presidential election. As reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Walker registered to vote in Georgia on Aug. 17, 2021, using a property owned by Blanchard as his registered address.¬†Financial disclosures indicate that Blanchard is the full owner of that property, and that it is primarily used to generate rental income. Walker has stated in an interview with Rolling Out that he rarely stays at this residence when he is in Georgia, and prefers to stay at hotels on which he is a board member.¬† ¬†As described by CNN, neither Walker's homestead exemption status nor the status of his registered address necessarily affect Walker's candidacy for office in that state:To run for office and vote in Georgia, 15 rules, not all of which need to be met, are considered for establishing residency, which include where the resident takes their homestead tax exemption and where they intend to live permanently. The US Constitution only requires a potential senator to be an inhabitant of their state when elected.Because Walker has declared that his Texas home is his principal residence and stands to benefit from tax breaks based on that declaration, the claim that Walker is a resident of Texas is ""True.""¬†"	true
3570	An explosion in Nashville, Tennessee, on Dec. 25, 2020, was caused by a missile or a direct-energy weapon.	"Many people woke up on Christmas morning in 2020 to the news that a large explosion had occurred near an AT&T building in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. As police set out to determine what happened ‚Äî authorities say that it was a suicide car bombing set up in the recreational vehicle of 63-year-old Anthony Quinn Warner ‚Äî conspiracy theorists went to work setting up an alternative narrative: The explosion was actually caused by a missile strike.¬†¬†This claim was spread on conspiratorial websites such as HalTurnerRadio.com and the right-wing social media network Parler, but is largely based on a single grainy piece of footage. Before we examine the video, let's look at the basis of this claim.¬†Two theories have been floated to connect the dots between an explosion in Nashville (which truly did occur) and a missile strike (which did not). The first holds that the goal of the missile strike was to destroy Room 641A, a ""telecom intercept facility."" This theory may have made more sense if 641A was located in Nashville. This room, which was reportedly used to carry out a warrantless surveillance program authorized under the Patriot Act, is actually located in San Francisco, California.¬†The more prominent claim, however, attempted to connect the explosion in Nashville to conspiracy theories related to fraud in the 2020 election. This theory held that the U.S. government had ordered the missile strike in order to halt an audit on Dominion voting machines. We took a deeper look into this claim in our article here. In short, this ""audit"" is imaginary. AT&T was not conducting an audit of Dominion Voting Systems.¬†While Room 641A is not located in Nashville, and while AT&T was not performing an audit on Dominion voting machines, it's in this context that many social media users viewed the ""missile"" attack video.¬†This claim is largely based on a single grainy piece of footage obtained by Nashville's WKRN News 2. Proponents of this theory claim that a missile can be seen descending just before the explosion. This streak of ""smoke"" is visible next to the furthest light post from the image foreground:¬†¬†While we can't say for certain what caused this ""smoke,"" it appears that this streak of smoke is ascending, as if it were a piece of fiery debris from the explosion, and not descending, as if it were a missile. A second, faint ascending streak can also be seen behind the main streak, which seems to support the idea that this is debris shooting away from the explosion, not towards it.¬†The visuals in this video do not support the ""missile"" theory, and neither does the logic. Not only is this missile attack theory based on fictitious information (there was no audit of Dominion machines), we find it difficult to believe that a high-powered group with access to military weapons would launch a missile strike at Nashville's AT&T building and miss, striking an RV that was parked outside on the street.The Nashville missile-strike conspiracy theory is largely based on speculation drawn from a single piece of grainy footage. Ample evidence exists, however, about what actually caused this explosion.In the wee hours of Dec. 25, police responded to calls of gunshots near the AT&T building. When they arrived, they found an RV that was broadcasting a message of an imminent explosion. Resident Betsy Williams said that she heard a computerized voice saying ""Evacuate now ... This vehicle will explode in 15 minutes."" Six uniformed officers also heard the warning message and started to evacuate the area.¬†Here's a video from a surveillance camera that captured this audio warning:A number of other videos also documented this blast. None of these videos shows anything resembling a missile strike. Here's a video of the explosion from the Nashville Police Department:Authorities have also determined that Warner was responsible for the bombing, although the motives of the long-time Nashville resident, who died in the blast, have yet to be determined.¬†¬†Hundreds of tips and a phalanx of law enforcement officers helped determine that Anthony Quinn Warner triggered the bomb that rocked this city and took his life on Christmas morning.All that information and effort, however, have thus far failed to determine why. Investigators on Monday continued to try to put together the pieces."	false

412	U.S. President Joe Biden convinced India, Australia, and Japan to join with the U.S. to form an organization called the Quad.	"The alliance known as the ‚ÄúQuad‚Äù was conceived after the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami, when the four countries came together to provide humanitarian assistance. It was formalized in 2007 by then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, before going dormant. Former U.S. President Donald Trump revitalized it in 2017, and it gained further momentum under the Biden administration.On 20 May 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden met with his counterparts Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India in Hiroshima for the fifth convening of the Quad Leaders' Summit on the sidelines of the G7 meetings.¬†While at the summit, a clip of Biden making following claim went viral: ""I doubt many people in this audience or any other audience would have said that two years after being elected, I'd be able to convince India, Australia, Japan, and the United States to form an organization called the Quad to maintain stability in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.""¬†A Twitter account run by the Republican National Committee shared the clip in question, pointing out that Biden's statement was incorrect: ""The Quad was re-established in 2017 under President Trump,"" the tweet said.Biden did indeed claim he personally convinced the three other nations to form the Quad, as confirmed in the¬†White House transcript¬†of that event. RNC Research was correct in stating that the Quad alliance was not Biden's brainchild. It emerged over the previous few decades and was revitalized under the Trump administration.What is the Quad? According to a Congressional Research Service (CRS) January 2023 report on the Quad, it is a ""four-country coalition, comprised of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia"" and ""claims a common platform of standing for a rules-based order, protecting freedom of navigation, and promoting democratic values in the region.""According to The Washington Post, the group began as a loose alliance in 2004 to coordinate relief efforts after a tsunami in the Indian Ocean. In 2007, then-Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe formalized the ties in the so-called Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. The group of nations met on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific forum convened by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2007. But by the next year, the Quad fell apart, largely over concerns about alienating China.¬†In 2017, the Quad reemerged under the Trump administration, which took a more confrontational approach to China. The CRS report credited Trump with beginning revitalization efforts, adding that in 2020 (Trump's last year in power, and the year Biden won the presidency) the Quad's reemergence was ""accelerated.""¬†A 2020 Foreign Policy analysis of Trump's motivations stated: ""the Quad today is defined less by what it stands for and more by what it opposes: China. The Trump administration has identified China as its primary adversary and therefore its top foreign-policy issue."" ¬†According to the CRS report, China's influence and military assertiveness continue to impact the motivations of the Quad, even under Biden. In its most recent joint statement in May 2023, the group made thinly veiled references to China's construction of bases on former offshore reefs, its harassment of non-Chinese vessels in international waters, and its economic leverage tactics over poorer countries.¬†The group¬†said: ""We strongly oppose destabilising or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion. [...] We express serious concern at the militarisation of disputed features, the dangerous use of coastguard and maritime militia vessels, and efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation activities.""China had already denounced the Quad in 2007, accusing it of undermining its interests. In 2018, China's foreign minister Wang Yi reacted to the group's revitalization effort with some scorn: ""They are like the sea foam in the Pacific or Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate."""	false

In early July 2020, social media users shared a purported screen shot of a tweet that was made to look like it had been written by U.S. President Donald Trump. The tweet called on South Dakota to ""keep there [sic] border with California closed!""Trump did travel to South Dakota to give a speech at Mount Rushmore on July 3, but he did not post the above tweet, which incorrectly states that the states of South Dakota and California share a border.The purported tweet doesn't appear on Trump's Twitter timeline on July 4, 2020, nor does it appear in a database that collects Trump's tweets or an archive that stores his deleted tweets."	false
2550	People are placing lethal strips of blue tape laced with fentanyl on random people's cars.	"One popular way to create viral social media content is to take an innocuous occurrence and tie it to a nefarious act. These pieces of scarelore have involved everything from errant zip ties (not a sign of sex trafficking), to rubber bands on door knobs (not a sign of impending burglary), to abandoned car seats (not a sign of sex trafficking).In the fall of 2021, another piece of scarelore was circulated on social media, this time claiming that people should be wary of painters tape on cars because it could be laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl.The post reads: ""If you find tape like this on your car do not take it off with your hands it is laced with fentanyl and will kill you ... People please by very safe there are a lot of crazies out there ready to do bad things to anyone for no reason this world is not the same.""This warning is not based in reality. There have been no police reports about people lacing painters tape with fentanyl and placing it on random cars in order to kill random people.¬†Furthermore, briefly touching fentanyl wouldn't be lethal. This issue was examined by a number of toxicologists in 2017 who found that it was practically impossible to overdose from the drug simply by touching it.¬†Dr. Ryan Marino, an emergency medicine physician and toxicologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said: ""It is impossible to overdose from accidentally touching fentanyl. The odds are zero.""The above-displayed image appears to have originated with a Sept. 4 Facebook post that now has more than 200,000 shares. While the original poster did not provide any evidence to support the claim, this person's niece provided a convincing explanation for how this tape got on car: It's from the car wash.¬†uncle Marky its from the car wash lol. Stela just told me you guys got a car wash too at the same place it's not fentanyl they put this so your gas tank won't open up ?????.. I got my car wash this morning ???????"	false
623	On April 4, 2023, former U.S. President Donald Trump was placed under arrest after turning himself in to the Manhattan District Attorney's office on hush-money charges.	"""Under arrest,"" in this context, merely means Trump was in the custody of New York authorities during the time of his processing and arraignment. This was expected and planned. On March 30, 2023, former U.S. President Donald Trump was indicted by the Manhattan District Attorney's office on charges related to hush-money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels, becoming the first ex-president to be indicted in a criminal investigation.¬†When news of the indictment went public, a spokesperson for the Manhattan court overseeing the case announced that Trump's arraignment would be held on April 4, 2023. As Snopes previously reported, representatives for Trump, the Secret Service, and New York Authorities negotiated, in advance, the terms of Trump's self-surrender.¬†As part of their agreement, Trump would voluntarily turn himself in to the court system, but would not be handcuffed. And as The New York Times reported, that is how the day played out: ""While in custody, [Trump] was fingerprinted, but special accommodations were made for him: He spent only a short time in the office before his court appearance and most likely was not handcuffed nor was a mug shot likely taken.""Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a former chief assistant with the Manhattan district attorney's office, explained to Insider in late March 2023 that Trump would be ""under arrest"" from the moment he surrendered. That's because, technically at least, Trump was in the custody of the New York Court system from the moment he surrendered until a judge approved the conditions of Trump's release during his arraignment.The arraignment was the first time the charges against the former president were read. After hearing the charges, according to The Times, Trump pleaded¬†not guilty to 34 felony charges."	true
1364	Veterans' spouses without a bachelor's degree can obtain a five-year teaching certificate in Florida after observing classrooms for 12 hours.	"A new law in Florida will allow U.S. military veterans to obtain a temporary teaching certificate without a bachelor's degree, as long as they meet other education requirements. However, contrary to erroneous reports, military spouses are not eligible for the ""Educator Certification Pathways for Veterans"" program.In July 2022, a new law was enacted in Florida that makes it easier for veterans to become teachers in that state. As news reports and social media posts started to circulate about this law, so did confusion about exactly what it entails. Are the spouses of veterans allowed to bypass degree requirements to become teachers? If so, what sort of training or education is required? In short, Florida's new law allows U.S. military veterans who do not have a bachelor's degree to obtain a teacher's certificate if they meet other requirements, such as passing a subject area examination demonstrating a bachelor's level of education. However, while Florida does waive certification fees for veterans' spouses (as well as active-duty military personnel and their spouses), only veterans themselves are eligible for the Military Veterans Certification Pathway program.  This rumor pertains to bill SB 896 which ""provides an alternative pathway for veterans seeking subject area certification by removing the requirement for a baccalaureate degree for issuance of their temporary educator certificate."" In order to qualify for the program, potential teachers must have served at least four years in the military and must have completed some college education. Furthermore, people teaching under these temporary certificates must be assigned a teaching mentor. The Florida Department of Education outlines the requirements, writing:Minimum of 48 months of military service with an honorable/medical dischargeMinimum of 60 college credits with a 2.5 grade point average Passing score on a Florida subject area examination for bachelor‚Äôs level subjectsEmployment in a Florida school district, including charter schoolsMilitary spouses are mentioned in SB 286, but only in the section stating that Florida will waive fees for spouses. Shortly after this law went into effect, several news outlets reported that both former military members and their spouses would be able to take advantage of this program and receive a temporary teacher's certificate without a bachelor's degree. Before issuing a correction, the Gainesville Sun reported: ""Last week, the Florida Department of Education announced that military veteran[s], as well as their spouses, would receive a five-year voucher that allows them to teach in the classroom despite not receiving a degree to do so.""A number of local news outlets also repeated this error as they republished a story from News Nation. On social media, one viral Facebook post claimed that a military spouse with no educational background had actually been awarded a teaching position after only 12 hours of classroom observation. The Florida DOE told us that the above rumor is ""completely false"" and that the Military Veteran Certification Pathway ""is not available for spouses of military veterans.""Confusion over this law appears to stem from some poor wording on the Florida DOE website. After this new law was enacted, the website contained a section entitled ""Military Personnel, Veterans & Spouses"" which summarized the various aspects of the new law. Here's how the DOE website looked on July 15, 2022:While not explicitly stated, it's easy to see how this text may have been misinterpreted, as the title includes ""spouses,"" the main text includes ""spouses,"" and the one underlined section states ""not yet earned their bachelor's degree."" This page has been reworked to more clearly state the impacts of this legislation. In fact, a bolded sentence has been added to the DOE website stating ""Military spouses and families are not eligible for this certification pathway."" Here's how the page looked on July 28, 2022:"	false
6111	School walkouts and protests are planned in response to the Parkland school shooting on 14 February 2018, which killed seventeen people.	"Following the 14 February 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Parkland Florida, people began posting information about planned school walkouts and protests, frequently with the hashtags #schoolwalkout or #nationalschoolwalkout.

The Sun Sentinel¬†reported:Perhaps the largest crowd came Wednesday [21 February 2018] afternoon when teens from various schools all converged on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, where authorities say Nikolas Cruz shot and killed 17 people. The demonstrators‚Äô long lines snaked for several city blocks, visible through the aerial images captured by news helicopters. Drivers passing by honked their horns in support ... U.S. Sen.

At least one high school has threatened disciplinary action against any student participating in a school walkout.On Facebook, a¬†""No Kids Left""¬†event¬†was scheduled for 20 April 2018, which urged parents to keep their children out of school for the entire day:Parents and Caregivers, please keep your children out of the classroom on Friday, April 20, 2018, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine HS massacre.

1415	A viral photograph purporting to show a bruised and disheveled Paul Pelosi is an authentic police mug shot.	"On May 28, 2022, businessman Paul Pelosi, the husband of U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in Napa County, California, after he was involved in a traffic accident. Given his connection to one of the most powerful politicians in the United States, Pelosi's arrest prompted a great deal of discussion and rumormongering on social media.One major topic of discussion was the whereabouts of Pelosi's arrest mug shot (which, in the immediat aftermath of the arrest, had still not been made public). One of the major rumors -- a hoax, actually -- was that the viral photograph below is that selfsame mug shot. As we will demonstrate shortly, it is not.The bruised and disheveled man in the supposed mug shot does resemble Paul Pelosi, and for good reason -- that man is Paul Pelosi, though this photograph of him was digitally modified to add bogus facial injuries and create the impression that it's a real police mug shot.In point of fact, this, from Getty Images, is the original photograph that was used to forge Pelosi's ""mug shot"":¬†BEVERLY HILLS, CA - FEBRUARY 14: Businessman Paul Pelosi (L) and minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) attend the 2016 Pre-GRAMMY Gala and Salute to Industry Icons honoring Irving Azoff at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on February 14, 2016 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)Below are the two photographs, closer up and side-by-side. The first thing you'll notice is that in addition to the apparent injuries, Pelosi's face in the ""mug shot"" photo on the right is noticeably wider, indicating that it was stretched horizontally by whoever fabricated the mug shot. Also, the color is washed out:¬†The creator of the fake mug shot (right) stretched the original image horizontally and desaturated the color.In the pair of photographs below, we've narrowed the ""mug shot"" at left to an aspect ratio better approximating that of the original photograph (at right) to facilitate comparison:¬†We've narrowed the aspect ratio of the ""mug shot"" (at left) to approximate the dimensions of the original.The unaltered facial features are identical. Compare the eyebrows, the mouth, the ears, the nose, the chin, the neck. Compare the facial shadows, as well. And notice how the outline of the orange shirt in the ""mug shot"" (left) appears to have been crudely drawn in after the fact.Below is our best attempt at combining the two images to demonstrate that the ""mug shot"" is fake -- a manipulated version of the original Getty photograph:Update: On June 13, 2022, the website of KRON, a San Francisco TV station, reported that Pelosi's actual mug shot taken the night of his arrest had finally been released to the public:The real mug shot was released by the Napa County Department of Corrections along with the following statement:Napa County Department of Corrections Releases Paul Pelosi Mugshot(NAPA, California) ‚Äî On the night of May 28, 2022, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) arrested Paul Pelosi (DOB 4/15/40) for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and Driving with a .08% Blood Alcohol Content or Higher. He was booked into the Napa County Department of Corrections and subsequently cite released the following morning.In Napa County, the decision to release or withhold mugshots or booking photos lies with the Napa County Department of Corrections, not the District Attorney's Office. In the days after Mr. Pelosi's arrest, Napa County followed the Department of Corrections' policy regarding the release of booking photos and mugshots. Mr. Pelosi received the same treatment under that policy that all individuals released from County Jail receive.No state law specifically requires the release of booking photos or mugshots, but policies regarding this topic can vary by jurisdiction. Napa County updated its policy to reflect current best practices and align with the policies of similar jurisdictions. As such, Napa County is now making available to the media and the public the booking photo of Mr. Pelosi taken at approximately 4:30 a.m. on May 29, 2022, at Napa County Department of Corrections.¬†Paul Pelosi's actual mug shot, released on June 13, 2022, by the Napa County Department of Corrections."	false

928	"Before choosing Jack Nicholson for the role, director Stanley Kubrick considered hiring Robin Williams to play the main character, Jack Torrance, in the horror film ""The Shining."""	"Casting the actors is one of the most important facets of making a film, and a subject movie fans never tire of speculating about. It is rumored, for example, that comedian Robin Williams was considered for the lead role of the crazed Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film ""The Shining,"" which ultimately starred Jack Nicholson in the role.In January 2023, we were asked by a reader if the claim that Williams was considered and passed up for the role is correct. We learned from the author of a forthcoming book about the making of ""The Shining"" that there is no evidence to substantiate the claim.Among the places we found the claim repeated was¬†the user-submitted trivia section of IMDb's entry on ""The Shining,"" where it is alleged that Robert DeNiro and Harrison Ford were also considered for the part:¬†Stanley Kubrick considered Robert De Niro and Robin Williams for the role of Jack Torrance, but decided against them. Kubrick did not think De Niro would suit the role after watching his performance in Taxi Driver (1976), as he deemed De Niro not psychotic enough for the role. He did not think Williams would suit the role after watching his performance on Mork & Mindy (1978), as he deemed him too psychotic for the role. According to Stephen King, Kubrick also briefly considered Harrison Ford.It also appears (again unsourced) in ""The Amazing Book of Movie Trivia"" (2015) by Jack Goldstein:¬†Stanley Kubrick put a great deal of thought into who to cast as Jack in The Shining. He first considered Robert De Niro, but after watching Taxi Driver, he didn't think he was psychotic enough. He then thought about Robin Williams, but having watched Mork and Mindy, Kubrick thought he came across as a little too psychotic. In the end, he cast Jack Nicholson, who displayed just the right amount of madness.And the claim is repeated, unsourced, on the website ScreenRant, as well:¬†When casting Jack Torrance for The Shining, director Stanley Kubrick considered Robin Williams at one point; the story goes that Kubrick was set on Williams until he watched an episode of the actor's TV series at the time, Mork and Mindy, and found the actor ""too psychotic"" for the role, casting Jack Nicholson instead.Our search for a reliable source eventually took us to the official @StanleyKubrick Twitter account, which is operated by the estate of the late film director. Although it addresses none of the auxiliary details mentioned above (such as the claim that Kubrick found Williams ""too psychotic,"" etc.), a Sept. 5, 2019, tweet from that account states that Williams, Ford, and De Niro were all, at one time or another, considered for the role of Jack Torrance in ""The Shining"":¬†However, film director and Kubrick aficionado Lee Unkrich, co-author of the forthcoming book ""Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining,'"" told Snopes via email that the story is simply not true. ""There are many apocryphal stories about the making of 'The Shining' that have spread online, and this is one of them,"" said Unkrich, who has had access to both the Kubrick Archive and Warner Bros. archive material related to ""The Shining.""¬†Stanley first read the galleys of Stephen King's novel in 1977. Nicholson was cast that year as well. Production on the film began in April of 1978. In 1977, Robin Williams was only 27 years old and had only a small handful of very tiny credits to his name. He didn't become a household name until 1978 when he starred in the television show ""Mork and Mindy."" Besides being far too young for the part of Jack Torrance (Nicholson was 40), Stanley Kubrick would never had considered an unknown to star in ""The Shining."" After the box-office disappointment of his previous film, ""Barry Lyndon,"" Kubrick was sorely in need of a hit, and he chose ""The Shining"" in an attempt to make a more commercial film. Kubrick had long wanted to work with Nicholson (they had discussed a biopic about Napoleon), and when Nicholson called Kubrick to ask what he was working on, Kubrick told him about ""The Shining.""¬†"	false

2. The unicorn is given regular access to sunlight, moonbeams, and rainbows.
3. The unicorn is fed one of its favorite treats -- watermelon -- at least once a week.
4. The unicorn's horn must be maintained to be in good health. This requires polishing at least once a month with a soft cloth.
5.

They see the horrible things animals do to people ‚Äî brutal maulings that are also occasionally deadly. And they often have to make tough decisions to euthanize animals when they're deemed too sick or too dangerous.¬†""It can be very emotionally draining to deal with that sort of life-and-death stuff all the time,"" Mayeda said.So Madeline's letter was a boon, one that's buoyed Mayeda and her colleagues for weeks, she said."	true
4564	Microwaving fabric masks is a good way to sanitize them for reuse.	"Snopes is still fighting an ‚Äúinfodemic‚Äù of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

On April 3, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new recommendation to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease: People should wear cloth or fabric face masks when they go grocery shopping, visit pharmacies, or do other essential errands. Made from T-shirts or bandanas, these face coverings are an at-home alternative to surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which the CDC recommended only for healthcare workers on the front lines of the pandemic.The recommendation ‚Äî which the CDC posted in a statement on its website alongside a 45-second video of U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams demonstrating how to make one of the cloth masks ‚Äî spurred a wave of do-it-yourself guides online.¬†But this raised a new dilemma among crafty Americans making their own masks: How should people clean the masks in order to safely reuse them? Making a new face guard for each trip outside could prove tedious.Cue the advice of Facebook: ""Those that use a fabric mask - after wearing place in ziplock bag and microwave 2-3 minutes to sanitize. Do this after each wear,"" says a post that users have shared more than 7,200 times. Another post with similar advice has about five times that amount of shares.People contacted Snopes seeking clarity.According to an April 9 instructional guide by the CDC, people who go outside wearing fabric or cloth masks should clean them regularly, the frequency of which depends on how often the face coverings are used. When asked by Snopes if microwaving cloth masks will sanitize them, a CDC spokesperson responded via email with a bulleted list of what cloth face coverings should do, including ""fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face"" and ""be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape."" The latter bullet point was highlighted yellow in the email.In other words, the CDC has not explicitly forbidden the public from microwaving the face coverings nor weighed in on the effectiveness of the method. But it has made this recommendation, including in its April 9 guide: ""A washing machine should suffice in properly washing a face covering.""Meanwhile, Greeneville/Greene County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security on Facebook warned against microwaving face masks, writing on Facebook:There are a couple of problems with this:
1. The microwave will set flame and/or burn certain materials.
2. If your mask has metal in it, refer to issue number 1, as well as, possibly killing your microwave.Please do NOT microwave your hand made masks.Washing in warm water and Antibacterial Soap and a small amount of bleach will disinfect your masks of any germs. Yes this includes COVID-19.""DO NOT place any face mask in the microwave for any amount of time,"" the Colorado River Fire Rescue department also said on Facebook. ""There is no evidence that microwaving a face mask will sanitize it properly."""	false
5459	Cesar Sayoc was a lifelong Democrat who ‚Äúrecently‚Äù plastered his van with pro-Trump stickers before sending bombs to Democrats and media figures.	"Following the arrest of Cesar Sayoc on charges that he sent mail bombs to prominent Democrats and anti-Trump media figures, the pro-Trump conspiracy contingent attempted to paint the suspect as a Democrat who posed as a Republican ‚Äî innuendo suggesting that Sayoc‚Äôs true goals were to inflict political damage on President Donald Trump and his agenda.Representative of this claim was a 26 October 2018 Facebook meme that labeled Sayoc as a ‚ÄúDemocrat posing as a Republican‚Äù and asserted he had ‚Äúrecently‚Äù put his infamous pro-Trump stickers on his van, describing those (false) claims as ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù:No evidence documents that Sayoc was a ""lifelong Democrat"" ‚Äî all signs point to his being relatively apolitical until 2015, although it appeared he attempted to register as a Republican twice in October 2012. And Sayoc‚Äôs van had sported pro-Trump stickers since at least 2017, and it had contained pro-Trump material since at least 2015.Although news reports have stated that Sayoc‚Äôs relatives are Democrats, Cesar Sayoc has never been registered as a Democrat. His only known voter registration listed his political affiliation as the Florida Republican Party, and it was filed two weeks before Trump won that state‚Äôs GOP primary. Additionally a public records request yielded documents indicating that Sayoc had attempted to register as a Republican twice in October 2012 but failed to complete his application in both cases:Records from the Miami-Dade County Elections Department show that on two occasions in October 2012 ‚Äî Oct. 9 and Oct. 26 ‚Äî Sayoc initiated, but didn‚Äôt complete, new voter registration applications. Both times, he checked the box next to ""Republican Party"" as his party affiliation.On Oct. 9, 2012, he checked the box that said his was a ""new registration,"" but it appears he left blank the answer to a question about whether he‚Äôd ever been ""adjudicated mentally incapacitated with respect to voting.""On Oct. 26, 2012, he didn‚Äôt check any of the boxes indicating the reason behind his registration application (i.e. new registration, address change, name change, party change, etc.) Near the top of that form, someone scribbled, ""INCOMP,"" indicating it was incomplete.According to news reports, most people who interacted with Sayoc prior to 2015 stated he did not appear to be overtly political. Ronald Lowy, a lawyer for the Sayoc family who represented Cesar during a 2002 case in which he threatened to bomb an electric company over a bill he disputed, told the New York Times that Sayoc ‚Äúseemed to have no outspoken partisan views during the 2002 case.‚ÄùDaniel Lurvey represented Sayoc against theft charges in 2013 and 2014, and he told the Washington Examiner that he could not recall Sayoc's ever discussing politics. Instead, it appears that Sayoc‚Äôs chief interests during this time were bodybuilding and wrestling.The pattern appeared to have changed by 2015. Sayoc showed up at a Brevard College alumni event for his soccer team that year, where former team members stated that ‚Äúhe quickly made clear he was a fanatical supporter of Mr. Trump, and bombarded them with racist and misogynist conspiracy theories.‚Äù Since that time, Sayoc had been an outspoken and fanatical supporter of Donald Trump and an equally outspoken opponent of Democrats online:On Twitter and Facebook, he railed against former President Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey with misspelled racial epithets, threatened former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and praised President Trump and conservative causes. His social-media feeds were an electronic version of the white van carted away by law-enforcement officials on Friday morning, which was covered in stickers praising Mr. Trump, condemning liberals and putting cross hairs over an image of Hillary Clinton.In 2015, as part of a likely effort to make a false insurance claim, Sayoc reported to police that $45,000 worth of ‚Äúsuits and costumes he needed for his business‚Äù were stolen from his van. According to the New York Times, the police report noted ‚Äúthat of the 139 pieces he said were taken, 11 were the president‚Äôs clothing brand.‚ÄùIt is unclear exactly when the outside of Sayoc's van was first festooned with pro-Trump political stickers, but the van had been a common sighting in the South Florida region since at least New Year's Eve of 2017, as reported by the Sun Sentinel:‚ÄúI saw this van dozens of times. It always struck me, always unsettled me. It appeared that somebody at times was in the van, though it was hard to tell because of the windows,‚Äù said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer who co-produced 2006‚Äôs ‚ÄúCocaine Cowboys"" ...Cypkin encountered the van regularly when he lived near the Shoppes at the Waterways in Aventura, where it was regularly parked. Cypkin believed someone could be living in the van, and finally, on the morning of New Year‚Äôs Eve 2017, he snapped a few quick pictures so he could get a better look at some of the stickers later. ‚ÄúI had seen it there at least a year,‚Äù Cypkin said."	false

3891	Joe Biden received a fraudulent 'dump' of 143K ballots in Wisconsin in the early morning hours after Election Day 2020.	"In the continuous stream of tweets alleging election fraud issued from the Twitter account of President Donald Trump in mid-November 2020, one tweet posted in the evening of Nov. 18 claimed that victorious Democratic presidential candidate had received an ""unbelievable"" ""dump of 143,379 votes at 3:42AM, when they learned he was losing badly"":It is true that Biden picked up about 149,000 votes in Wisconsin around 3:30 AM in the early morning hours following the election, thereby erasing a lead Trump had held in the in-progress vote tally up to that point:However, no fraudulent activity of furtive ""dump"" of ballots was behind this phenomenon. By law, Wisconsin was not allowed to begin tabulating absentee ballots (no matter how early they were sent in) until 7:00 AM on Election Day.  Biden's vote count took a big jump (while Trump's increased much more modestly) around the time in question because that was when Milwaukee County finished and reported the tabulation of its approximately 170,000 absentee ballots.  That occurrence was doubly favorable for Biden, both because Democrats were far more likely to vote via absentee ballots, and because Milwaukee County is the most populous county in Wisconsin and is an overwhelmingly Democratic area:The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on the bulge in Biden votes, and the reasons behind it, at the time it took place:
Biden overtook Trump in the early morning hours when Milwaukee reported its roughly 170,000 absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Then early morning returns from Green Bay and Kenosha on Wednesday added to his slender lead.Trump had nurtured a lead of more than 100,000 votes before those returns came in.
By the morning after the election, even Trump had recognized (if not accepted) the phenomenon of mail-in ballots in most states being heavily Democratic, in large part because he discouraged his supporters from using that method of voting:In fact, more than two months before the election, NPR had observed that ""President Trump's campaign to discourage the use of mail-in voting this fall is raising concerns among Republicans, particularly in the key swing state of Wisconsin, that his efforts could hinder their party on election night.""As of this writing, Biden has won Wisconsin (and its 10 electoral votes) by just over 20,000 votes out of more than 3.2M ballots cast:"	false
5532	North Carolina admitted that a voter ID law was at least partly enacted in response to African-American voting tendencies that went against conservative interests.	"Tweets by two academics in October 2018 shed light on legislative efforts in North Carolina to target non-white voters, as documented by court excerpts they shared which were distributed widely online.On 15 October 2018, Sarah Damaske, an associate professor of labor and employment relations at Penn State University, shared a tweet from University of Chicago professor Harold Pollak linking to a federal court decision regarding the state's ""voter ID"" law, known as House Bill 589 or SL 2013-381:This can‚Äôt be retweeted enough. North Carolina publicly stated in court that the reason they stopped Sunday voting was that counties with Sunday voting were disproportionately black, and blacks disproportionately vote Democrat. https://t.co/5C3lCMSmix‚Äî Sarah Damaske (@SarahDamaske) October 15, 2018The law, which was passed in 2013, shortened the early voting period from 17 days to ten and eliminated both same-day voter registration and two Sunday voting dates which frequently saw African-American churches provide rides for parishioners to the polls.While Pollak's original tweet posted a day earlier, had been shared more than 9,000 times Damaske's amplification of it had been retweeted nearly 23,000 times within a week after her posting of it.""I think people picked it up, because there is a lot of concern about the many stories about voter suppression along racial lines in this election cycle (even though the story that Dr. Pollack tweeted about and that I re-tweeted was from an earlier voting cycle),"" Damaske said of the re-circulated tweet. The legal excerpt cited in the tweet was taken from a 29 July 2016 decision by the the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit which struck down the voter ID law:As ""evidence of justifications"" for the changes to early voting, the State offered purported inconsistencies in voting hours across counties, including the fact that only some counties had decided to offer Sunday voting. The State then elaborated on its justification, explaining that ""[c]ounties with Sunday voting in 2014 were disproportionately black"" and ""disproportionately Democratic.""The decision overturned a district court ruling upholding the state voter ID law. Writing for the 4th Circuit, Judge Diana Gribbon called the prior decision ""erroneous"":Socioeconomic disparities establish that no mere ""preference"" led African Americans to disproportionately use early voting, same-day registration, out-of-precinct voting, and preregistration. Nor does preference lead African Americans to disproportionately lack acceptable photo ID. Yet the district court refused to make the inference that undeniably flows from the disparities it found many African Americans in North Carolina experienced. Registration and voting tools may be a simple ""preference"" for many white North Carolinians, but for many African Americans, they are a necessity.According to Gribbon, the 4th Circuit court concluded ""that the General Assembly would not have eliminated same-day registration entirely but for its disproportionate impact on African Americans,"" and said that parts of the law amounted to solutions in search of a problem:The only clear factor linking these various ""reforms"" is their impact on African American voters. The record thus makes obvious that the ""problem"" the majority in the General Assembly sought to remedy was emerging support for the minority party. Identifying and restricting the ways African Americans vote was an easy and effective way to do so. We therefore must conclude that race constituted a but-for cause of SL 2013-381, in violation of the Constitutional and statutory prohibitions on intentional discrimination.In May 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court opted not to hear an appeal of the lower court's ruling:
The U.S. Supreme Court rebuffed a Republican bid to revive a strict North Carolina voter-identification law that a lower court found deliberately discriminated against black voters, handing a victory to Democrats and civil rights groups.The appeals court found that the law‚Äôs provisions ‚Äútarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision‚Äù and ‚Äúimpose cures for problems that did not exist,‚Äù concluding that the Republican-led legislature enacted it ‚Äúwith discriminatory intent.‚Äù"	true
4714	"The cover of the Beatles' ""Help!"" album shows the group spelling out the word ""help"" in semaphore."	"On Aug. 6, 1965, the Beatles issued their fifth LP, ""Help!"", comprising the seven songs featured in their just-released feature film of the same name, plus seven additional tracks. (The U.S. version was offered as a soundtrack album that included only the songs appearing in the film, plus additional incidental music.)In 1965, adventurously offbeat or arty record album covers were rare in the pop music world, and ""Help!"" did not contribute much to breaking that pattern, offering a rather plain display of the group and album names, along with a picture of the Fab Four garbed in clothing they wore while filming skiing sequences in the Austrian Alps for the ""Help!"" movie:But as Beatles fans were wont to do -- especially in the wake of the ""Paul is dead"" rumor that erupted several years later -- enthusiasts scoured all aspects of the band's records for hidden messages and meanings. In this particular case, the rumored secret message was the interesting (if unexciting) claim that the Beatles were posed on the album cover in such a way that their arm positions spelled out H-E-L-P in semaphore.In fact, the Beatles weren't posed in a way that spelled out H-E-L-P, or anything else meaningful, in semaphore. Their arm positions corresponded, at best, to either the sequence N-U-J-V or N-V-U-J, depending upon whether one examined the U.K. or U.S. version of the album (which featured slightly different arrangements of the four group members on their covers):Photographer Robert Freeman, who shot the cover for ""Help!"" as well as three other Beatles albums, acknowledged that he had initially considered trying to arrange the group shot to spell out H-E-L-P, but in the end he opted to simply go with the positioning that had the best visual appeal -- regardless of meaning:The Beatles were filming a sequence in Austria where they stood on a skyline in the snow waving their arms to a music playback. From this I had the idea of semaphore spelling out the letters HELP. But when we came to do the shot the arrangement of the arms with those letters didn't look good. So we decided to improvise and ended up with the best graphic positioning of the arms.The shot was set up at the film studio near London where the Beatles were finishing the last scenes. They stood on a specially constructed platform with a white painted background wearing the black hats, coats and capes from the film wardrobe. I used a larger format camera to get detail on their faces because of the distance at which the shots were taken.It was a simple, graphic set-up bit. I think the cover would have had more impact with just the Beatles in the white space and no lettering at all. After all, they were at the height of their fame and easily recognizable. What they didn't need was HELP!"	false
949	"Alec Baldwin said ""How about i just fuckin' shoot the both of ya"" before firing a prop gun that killed Halyna Hutchins."	"A woman was accidentally killed on the set of a movie after prop gun was fired by Alec Baldwin. Fake newspaper clippings saying that this accident occurred after Baldwin threatened the crew, or that the accident occurred during a ""rant"" against former President Donald Trump, are false. On October 21, 2021, news broke that Halyna Hutchins, the director of photography on the movie ""Rust,"" had been killed after a prop gun was fired by actor Alec Baldwin. As news of the accident made waves on social media, at least two fake newspaper clippings were circulated which added unfounded and untrue details to the story.¬†The first claimed that Baldwin had been asked to do another take on the set. The actor refused, according to the fake clipping, and then said: ""How about I just fuckin' shoot the both of ya"" and then fired the prop gun.¬†This is not a genuine news article. The majority of the above-displayed text in the above-displayed image comes from an article published in Variety. It appears that whoever created this fake newspaper clipping simply copied Variety's article, and then slipped in a fictitious quote. Here's the passage from the genuine news source:No one was arrested in the incident, and no charges have been filed, the office said. Detectives were interviewing witnesses, and the incident remains under an ""open and active"" investigation, according to the Sheriff's office.Baldwin's reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Hutchins' death was confirmed by the Sheriff's office and by the International Cinematographers Guild, Local 600.While it's unclear where this fake newspaper clipping originated, it was spread on the internet forum 4chan in a thread that disparaged the ""left's favorite actor.""A second fake news clipping was also circulated in the immediate wake of this tragic accident. In this fake newspaper clipping, it is claimed that Baldwin fired the prop gun while waving it around during a rant about former President Donald Trump:This, again, is a fake news article that was created by inserting a fictitious sentence into a real news piece. The majority of the text seen above was originally published by Fox News. The original Fox News article, however, did not report that Baldwin had been ranting about Trump.Here's the excerpt from Fox News:A press release from the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department said deputies were dispatched to the set around 1:50 p.m. local time, and the call indicated that an individual had been shot.Investigators said that the prop firearm was being used during filming when it was discharged by Baldwin, hitting his director of photography, Halyna Hutchins and director Joel Souza.

3580	A 9-pound ‚Äúgoldfish‚Äù was caught in a South Carolina lake during a routine electrofishing survey.	Officials conducting a routine fish population survey in December 2020 wound up with quite the unexpected catch when they discovered a 9-pound ‚Äúgoldfish‚Äù in a South Carolina lake.A photo of the giant goldfish was shared to Facebook and Instagram on Dec. 7, 2020, by Greenville Rec, which oversees the park.‚ÄúAnyone missing their goldfish?‚Äù joked Greenville Rec on social media. ‚ÄúThis 9lb goldfish was found in Oak Grove Lake during some work including electrofishing, a method of measuring the health of the fish population.‚ÄùTy Houck with the Greenville County Parks told NBC that the fish was found swimming on Nov. 16 in the 18-acre lake Oak Grove Lake in Greenville, South Carolina. A fisheries management plan was implemented in 2014 and as of June 2015, the fish population was deemed stable enough to open the lake for fishing on two days a week. The lake is intentionally stocked with bass, bream, and catfish ‚Äî but the ‚Äúgoldfish‚Äù appeared to be an anomaly.Though county officials claimed that the fish was a goldfish, some social media users pointed out that it was in fact a species of koi.Both koi, the scientific name Cyprinus carpio, and goldfish, Carassius auratus, are domesticated forms of carp from the same family, Cyprinidae. The Smithsonian National Zoo noted that koi have been domesticated for their ornamental features for centuries in China and Japan, and are bred in dozens of different colors. But despite the urban legend, Japanese koi exporter Koi Acres said that a koi will not grow to the relative size of its pond or aquarium ‚Äî the bigger the pond the bigger the fish. Rather, koi have a genetically predetermined size, like most animals, and will grow according to their environmental factors and health.It‚Äôs not abnormal for koi to grow to pretty massive sizes. Koi can weigh up to 35 pounds and reach a length of 3 feet ‚Äî and with larger sizes comes greater age. Koi have an average lifespan of 40 years, but the oldest known koi lived to be nearly 230 years old. (Researchers were able to determine its age by counting growth rings on the fish‚Äôs scales.) Goldfish, by comparison, typically vary in length from 4 to 16 inches and weigh up to a half-pound, according to National Geographic. That being said, the world's longest goldfish measured in at a whopping 18.7 inches from snout to tail-fin.¬†As for the South Carolina giant, surveyors reported that it was released without issue.	true

2270	A 2,000-year-old skull from modern-day Peru had a metal plate inserted to treat a skull fracture.	"In 2020 and 2021, the Museum of Osteology in Oklahoma posted photographs of a 2,000-year-old skull with a feature that might be surprising to modern audiences. The skull had evidence of a surgical procedure intended to mend a skull fracture:The text included in the above post, dated April 22, 2021, reads:Last year we posted this elongated skull with metal surgically implanted to help heal a traumatic injury. This skull is now on public display at our museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. We thought we would answer some of your commonly asked questions below.Yes, this is a real human skull that is thousands of years old. Elongation was achieved through head binding beginning at a very young age. It was typically practiced to convey social status by various cultures.This individual survived the [metal] procedure, known as trephination, based on evidence of bone remodeling. Trephination was practiced by nearly all ancient civilizations by different means and for different reasons.The material used was not poured as molten metal. We do not know the composition of the alloy. The plate was used to help bind the broken bones. Although we can't guarantee anesthesia was used, we do know many natural remedies existed for surgical procedures during this time period.In the April 2020 post mentioned above, the skull was estimated to be 2,000 years old and belonged to a soldier injured in battle. Surprising as it may seem, the patient survived the procedure, as evidenced by the fact that bone surrounding it fused together.National Geographic reported that the procedure, known as trepanation, was relatively common in what was then the Inca Empire in South America, because in that region, the weapons of war were primarily sling stones and clubs ‚Äî weapons that had a high likelihood of causing serious head injuries.John Verano, a physical anthropologist at Tulane University and author of the book ""Holes in the Head: The Art and Archaeology of Trepanation in Ancient Peru,"" told National Geographic that the survival rate was surprisingly high, around 70 percent."	true
1	"The act of copying and pasting a block of text into a new Facebook post can ""bypass the system"" that limits the number of friends' posts that appear in your News Feed."	"In August 2023, Facebook users copied and pasted a boilerplate message into new posts about how to ""bypass the system"" to thwart an ""algorithm"" that purportedly ""limits posts on your News Feed"" to ""about 25"" friends.The text of the post claimed that ""it works,"" something that was echoed by numerous commenters.In this story, we explain why users were making this false claim. We also take a look back at the time that Facebook directly addressed this very same hoax, calling it a ""myth.""One of the more popular versions of the viral post read as follows:I would like to thank Everyone for telling me how to do the bypass. I wondered where everybody had been!This is good to know: It's ridiculous to have over 540 friends and only 25 are allowed to see my post.It WORKS!! I have a whole new news feed. I'm seeing posts from people I haven't seen in years.Here's how to bypass the system FB now has in place that limits posts on your news feed.Their new algorithm chooses the same few people - about 25 - who will read your posts. Therefore,Hold your finger down anywhere in this post and ""copy"" will pop up. Click ""copy"". Then go your page, start a new post and put your finger anywhere in the blank field. ""Paste"" will pop up and click paste.This will bypass the system.If you are reading this message, do me a favor and leave me a quick comment...a ""hello,"" a sticker, whatever you want, so you will appear in my newsfeed!I'll see if this works.Basically, no, copying and pasting a block of text into a new Facebook post does not ""bypass"" any ""system"" or change the website's ""algorithm,"" as we've repeatedly reported in past years.In our research for this story, we noticed some online users who claimed, ""This one actually works!"" This claim brings with it a misunderstanding of preceding events, kind of like the scene from the U.S. version of ""The Office"" in which¬†Dunder Mifflin Regional Manager Michael Scott and Assistant (to the) Regional Manager Dwight Schrute both yell in celebration, ""We did it!,"" then moments later appear puzzled at how a goal had been accomplished.The viral post makes a request of users that says, ""If you are reading this message, do me a favor and leave me a quick comment...a 'hello,' a sticker, whatever you want, so you will appear in my newsfeed!""Just like with any kind of Facebook post, if a friend responds with a like or a comment, those two people might then be more likely to see each other's posts in News Feed. In other words, it's the engagement with likes and comments ‚Äì not the ""bypass the system"" copy-and-paste post ‚Äì that would potentially drive friends to the top of one's News Feed.For example, Bob could post, ""I like turtles."" If Tim likes the post or adds a comment, Bob and Tim might then be more likely to see each other's posts more often at the top of News Feed. This change would have nothing to do with the fact that the post was about turtles.RELATED:¬†Can Some Turtles Breathe Through Their Butts?In 2019, Facebook¬†addressed¬†the ""bypass the system"" posts.""Copy-and-paste memes ‚Äî those blocks of text posted on message boards, forwarded in emails and shared via social media ‚Äî are as old as the internet,"" the company wrote.The article continued:A recent example started popping up in late 2017 and continues to see the occasional bump in shares. This meme claims that Facebook's ""new algorithm"" is limiting the number of people whose posts show up in your News Feed, usually pegging the number at just 25 or 26 people. Readers are directed to comment on the post, which will supposedly ""bypass the system"" so that their posts show up in the future, and then copy and paste the text on their own Feeds....So, to clear things up: No, Facebook does not set a limit on the number of people whose posts are shown in your News Feed.Facebook's article then went on to explain how the News Feed works, including pointing out the fact that, if a user continued to scroll down for more than just a few seconds, they would see many posts from far more than the ""about 25"" friends that was claimed in the viral post.On one hand, these kinds of silly copy-and-paste ""here's how to change the algorithm"" Facebook posts show mankind's ongoing susceptibility to falling for online hoaxes ‚Äì despite the fact that such myths have been continually discredited by articles from a seemingly countless number of publications ‚Äì the kind of stories that are accessible to everyone using Facebook."	false

Despite a lack of evidence to support it, Green's sensational quote was picked up by a number of websites.We reached out to Green by email to ask where he got this information and whether he had any evidence for his claims, but got no reply.We also reached out to Minneapolis Police Sgt. John Elder, who confirmed that while the City Council did state its intent to ""reimagine"" policing, the Minneapolis Police Department is still operating. ""We absolutely are here and will not abandon our communities!"" Elder stated in an email.Not only is there no apparent evidence for Green's claim that antifa and Muslim groups are policing Minneapolis, but the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has called on GOP leaders to repudiate Green's statement, calling it hate-filled.As the Minneapolis-based alternate newspaper CityPages reported, the Twin Cities are no stranger to Islamophobic rhetoric and violence:It should go without saying that, no, people are not trying to impose ‚ÄúMuslim rule‚Äù on Minneapolis, but we kind of end up having to say it a lot. Back in April, as false rumors of mosques staying open during quarantine bounced around Facebook, Council on American-Islamic Relations executive director Jaylani Hussein called the spread of such conspiracies ‚Äúhate-bating.‚ÄùThey might seem harlmess [sic], even laughable, until someone gets hurt. And if watching a group of Illinois men blow up a Bloomington mosque in the summer of 2017 has taught Twin Cities‚Äô Muslim communities anything, it‚Äôs that they very well can.Green's comments came in the aftermath of nationwide protests against structural racism and police violence after video of the in-custody death of George Floyd, a Black man, went viral in May 2020. The video showed Floyd begging for his life as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck.In the wake of sustained, international protests, Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder in Floyd's death, and three other officers at the scene were charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Minneapolis City Council also voted to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department, stating it could not be reformed.However, that doesn't mean the police department disappeared overnight. Members of the City Council stated that the change would be gradual, and that they are still in the process of laying the groundwork for what the future holds for public safety in Minneapolis.As some of the earlier protests had turned violent, U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies had sought to blame ""antifa"" without evidence. As The New York Times noted, ""antifa, a contraction of the phrase 'anti-fascist,' is not an organization with a leader, a defined structure or membership roles"" but rather ""antifa is more of a movement of activists whose followers share a philosophy and tactics."""	false
360	An image shows a sonogram of a fetus smiling in his mother's womb.	"On May 31, 2023, the independent, anti-abortion news outlet LifeNews posted an image to Facebook that purportedly showed a fetus smiling in his mother's womb. The image also displayed a picture of what was believed to be the same baby smiling after he was born. The caption read, ""Baby before birth. Baby after.""On the next day, we received mail from a reader who asked if we could confirm the post's veracity.""I saw the attached photo on Facebook on a friend's page,"" the email read. ""The 'before' looks Photoshopped to me, but I don't know how to check that.

"In early April 2021, a meme circulated on social media that purportedly showed an image of an unfortunately named crayon.The crayon in the picture above contains a label that reads ""dog weiner,"" the implication being that the color of the crayon was named for a dog's genitalia (although the word ""wiener,"" shortened from Wienerschnitzel, is misspelled).The real color of the crayon can actually be seen in finer print in the picture: Shocking Pink. And obviously, Crayola doesn't manufacture a crayon for mass consumption named for misspelled dog genitals. But various social media posts have indicated that Crayola lets people create their own crayon labels in an interactive factory tour called Crayola Experience.Of course, Crayola probably thought people would personalize crayon labels with things like their own names, and not ""dog weiner"" and other off-color slogans.

4039	Trump knew the identity of the administration insider who penned an anonymous Op-Ed and book critical of the president.	"On Sept. 5, 2018, The New York Times took ""the rare step of publishing an anonymous Op-Ed essay"" attributed to a Trump administration official. The anonymous author claimed to be part of a ""resistance"" consisting of ""many of the senior officials in [Trump's] administration [who] are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations"" and maintained that U.S. President Donald Trump was ""acting in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic,"" painting a picture of dysfunctional chief executive who governed based on ephemeral whims and impulses, rather than thorough and consistent reasoning:From the White House to executive branch departments and agencies, senior officials will privately admit their daily disbelief at the commander in chief‚Äôs comments and actions. Most are working to insulate their operations from his whims.Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back.‚ÄúThere is literally no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next,‚Äù a top official complained to me recently, exasperated by an Oval Office meeting at which the president flip-flopped on a major policy decision he‚Äôd made only a week earlier.The publication of the controversial Op-Ed piece (which was followed up by the publication of similarly anonymous full-length book titled ""A Warning"") sent journalists, government officials, and pundits scurrying to fathom the identity of ""Anonymous,"" much as they had spent decades trying to unmask the mysterious source known as ""Deep Throat"" who provided information key to unraveling the WatergateWhen Trump himself was later asked by a reporter whether a search to root out Anonymous was underway, the president confidently stated that no such search was really necessary, because he already knew the identity of the writer:Q: Is there a search under way for Anonymous? Remember Anonymous?A: Yeah, there is. It's not so much a search. I know who it is. I can't tell you that, but I know ... but we won't get into it. People know it's fraud, I know who it is.""https://youtu.be/qpdvEwIBz4k

Many commentators at the time questioned why if Trump -- who had demonstrated a penchant for loudly disparaging and discrediting those who defied or spoke poorly of him -- knew the identity of Anonymous, he didn't publicly out that person and ostentatiously dismiss the employee from the administration. As later events would prove, Trump didn't take those steps because, contrary to his claims, he had no idea who Anonymous was.On Oct. 28. 2020, Anonymous self-revealed via Twitter, disclosing himself to be Miles Taylor, a security expert who served as a policy adviser in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from 2017 to 2019 and was chief of ctaff to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen (who resigned from that position in April 2019, followed by Taylor a few months later):After (and only after) Taylor revealed himself, Trump engaged in the expected rounds of disparagement and discrediting, declaring Taylor to be a ‚Äúsleazebag‚Äù and a ‚Äúlow-level employee‚Äù who had never worked in the White House and had been ‚Äúquickly removed from his job a long time ago‚Äù (even though Taylor was clearly involved in meetings with Trump and said that he had resigned, not been fired, from his DHS position).Trump also tweeted and retweeted claims that Taylor was merely a ""staffer"" and not a ""senior administration official"" and labeled him as a scammer ... while not refuting that Taylor nonetheless had been able to speak from a position of direct knowledge as a member of the Trump administration, or disputing the truthfulness of anything Taylor wrote:https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1321568122017517568
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1321568126635368448https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1321858569466114048
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1321858573278695425Key to these tweets was that Trump, as he has often done when his association with persons working for or with him turns negative, attempted to distance himself by declaring that he didn't know, and had ""never even heard of,"" Taylor. But of course, if Trump had ""never even heard of"" Taylor until the latter's self-reveal as Anonymous, then Trump must have been lying or completely mistaken when he much earlier proclaimed that he knew for a fact who Anonymous was."	false

826	"Fox News changed its accreditation from ""news"" to ""entertainment."""	"In 2013, an entertainment website published a fictitious article that claimed Fox News had been reclassified as ""satire"" by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and that the network would start displaying a disclaimer reading: ""This is not a valid news source."" While that fictitious article was clearly not genuine news, the general idea that Fox News was not an ""accredited news station"" has often been repeated.In January 2019, we were notified about a meme claiming that Fox News changed its accreditation from ""news"" to ""entertainment,"" and that it had no legal obligation to report the facts:This may not make you happy;Fox News it not an accredited news station. They have changed their accreditation to ""entertainment."" They legally don't have to provide any facts in their reporting. Fox News is in the same category as Saturday Night Live, Laugh-In, and Swamp People.¬†You don't have to believe me, look it up yourself.¬†While the term ""accredited news station"" may sound official, no regulatory body even exists that would accredit Fox News (or CNN, MSNBC, etc.) as a ""news"" station. In addition, a spokesperson for Fox News said the meme's claims were false.¬†Among other issues, the meme is a bit nonsensical because it conflates over-the-air broadcasts and cable broadcasts, as well as Fox Broadcasting Company and Fox News Channel.The Fox Broadcasting Company is an over-the-air television network licensed by the FCC. This is the station where you find programming such as ""The Simpsons. The Fox News Network is a cable news channel. The latter is where you'd find programming such as ""Fox & Friends"" and ""Hannity."" While the FCC licenses and regulates over-the-air broadcasts, it has no authority over cable news channels.A spokesperson for the FCC told us that, ""We do not have any rules or licensing requirements in which a cable channel might categorize itself as news vs. entertainment.""John Bergmayer, senior counsel at Public Knowledge, an intellectual property group based in Washington, D.C., talked to the New York Daily News in 2017 after the FCC received hundreds of complaints about another cable news channel, CNN. Bergmayer explained that because cable news channels are run by private providers, the FCC has no authority to control the programming:The FCC regulates broadcast networks, since the airwaves are free and public. But cable channels, which rely on subscribers, viewers and advertisers, are beyond government control. Since cable runs through private providers, the FCC plays no role in issuing or revoking licenses, and it has no say on what the channels can air.""The hook for (broadcast) content regulation ... is the fact that broadcasters have government-issued licenses that allow them to use the airwaves, and that it's freely available to anyone with a receiver,"" said John Bergmayer, senior counsel at Public Knowledge, an intellectual property group based in Washington, D.C.""This doesn't apply to cable networks.""The FCC does have regulations regarding the distribution of false information, but again, this only applies to over-the-air programs on networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, or Fox Broadcasting (but not the Fox News Channel). Furthermore, the offense would have to be pretty egregious and well-documented in order for the FCC to step in.¬†¬†The FCC explains on its website that it has a ""very narrow scope"" to police news programs because it is prohibited by law from ""engaging in censorship or infringing on First Amendment rights of the press.""¬†The FCC's authority to respond to these complaints is narrow in scope, and the agency is prohibited by law from engaging in censorship or infringing on First Amendment rights of the press. Moreover, the FCC cannot interfere with a broadcaster's selection and presentation of news or commentary.[...]The FCC is prohibited by law from engaging in censorship or infringing on First Amendment rights of the press. It is, however, illegal for broadcasters to intentionally distort the news, and the FCC may act on complaints if there is documented evidence of such behavior from persons with direct personal knowledge. For more information, please see our consumer guide, Complaints About Broadcast Journalism.Fox News (as well as CNN and MSNBC) is not an accredited news station because no regulatory body exists in the United States that has the authority to make such a classification.¬†But while the meme is false, it is reminiscent of a genuine news story from 2017, when Ofcom, the United Kingdom's communications regulator, ruled that the shows ""Hannity"" and ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" had breached their impartiality rules while reporting on the Manchester Arena bombing and President Donald Trump's travel ban:Ofcom's ruling concluded there was ""no reflection of the views of the UK government or any of the authorities or people criticised"" and the presenter ""did not challenge the views of his contributors; instead, he reinforced their views.""Ofcom found the programme breached rules 5.9, 5.11 and 5.12 of the British broadcasting code. These relate to adequate representation of alternative views on discussions programmes, due impartiality on matters of major political or industrial controversy, and including a wide range of significant views when dealing with major political or industrial controversy.We should note this ruling only pertained to specific reporting on two Fox News shows and not to the network as a whole. The ruling was also made after Sky had already pulled Fox News from the airwaves and therefore did not result in fines or in official changes to the classification of the network.¬†"	false
531	An image shows a fourth-grade science quiz about 'Dinosaurs: Genesis and the Gospel' from a South Carolina school.	"An image purportedly showing a ""4th Grade Science Quiz"" hit the Internet in April 2013, showing a classroom test entitled ""Dinosaurs: Genesis and the Gospel"" and consisting of several true/false and short-answer questions about dinosaurs and the Bible, which a student had all answered correctly in accordance with religious Young Earth creationism (rather than scientific) principles:The title of the quiz was the same as that of a DVD produced by the group Answers in Genesis and hewed closely to the material presented therein, including the admonition that ""If someone tells you the earth is millions of years old, what should be your reply? 'Were you there?'"" and the reference to the Bible as ""The History Book of the Universe.""The image was of the purported quiz publicized in a post to Reddit's r/atheism forum, made by a user who maintained that it was a real quiz given at a private religious school in South Carolina, and that he was shown the quiz by the student's parent and took a picture of it with his iPhone. He declined to identify the school, stating that ""I am not publicizing it since it is a small school and I don't want any publicity that might reflect badly on the kid"" and ""I don't want the kid to get in trouble, so I am keeping that under my hat until June when school is over,"" although he did allow that the school was ""North of Greer, SC.""A few days after the Reddit posting, a reader wrote to us and stated that the quiz displayed above belonged to his 10-year-old daughter, saying:I didn't know that this was being taught to her until we heard a radio commercial together about the Discover the Dinosaurs exhibit was coming to the TD Convention Center [in Greenville, South Carolina].The Commercial starts out, ""After 65 million years, the dinosaurs have returned ..."" She commented immediately that it was only four thousand years ago. When I corrected her, she snapped back, ""Were you there?"" I have since taught my daughter differently, but I am sure she is confused now and plan to make sure she understands that teachers are people too and can be factually wrong.The test showed up [at] home a day later to my disgust.It's a great school for Reading, Writing and Math. She is ahead of most of her peers and also is taking Latin there. But I now know to be vigilant for the rest of the year about her science teachings.She will not be attending the school next year ...He indicated that he wouldn't disclose the name of the school until the end of the current school year in June, but he did forward us an image of the second page of the quiz:We noted that there is a school, Blue Ridge Christian Academy, that meets all of the criteria described above: a private Christian Academy which is both in the Greenville area of South Carolina and north of Greer, which offers ""science lessons [that] are creation-based,"" and which includes Latin in its fourth-grade curriculum. Blue Ridge didn't respond to our inquiry, but Ken Ham and Mark Looy of Answers in Genesis (AiG) confirmed in the AiG blog that the quiz did indeed originate with that school:In South Carolina recently, a fourth-grade teacher at Blue Ridge Christian Academy (a nondenominational K‚Äì12 Christian school) showed students a DVD of a children's program, in which AiG song-writer and dinosaur sculptor Buddy Davis and I are featured. In this DVD, we teach children the history of the universe from the Bible, with a special emphasis on teaching dinosaurs from a biblical perspective (as we do inside our Creation Museum). The teacher handed out a question sheet to the children to test what they learned from the DVD.A friend of one of the parents who has a child enrolled in the fourth grade class posted the quiz sheets on the internet. The parent, like all parents who have children enrolled at this academy, had signed a statement, which acknowledged an understanding that sending their child to this Christian school would mean they would be taught biblical Christianity. The parent expressed dismay that his daughter was taught a biblical approach to dinosaurs. The quiz's posting to the internet resulted in a number of atheist websites reposting the questions and answers, and many of them responded in rage and vehement attacks on the school."	true
4637	St. Corona is the patron saint of plagues.	"In March 2020, as the COVID-19 coronavirus disease continued to spread around the globe, many social media users encountered a rumor that was almost too perfect to believe: A ""patron of saint of plagues"" or ""pandemics"" existed, and she shared a name with the virus at the center of the outbreak: Corona.Gloria TV was one of the first to report on this rumored coincidence:There Is A SAINT CORONA, And She Is the Patron Saint Against EPIDEMICSIn Anz√π, Northern Italy, the hotbed of the coronavirus in Europe, is a basilica where the relics of Saint Victor and Saint Corona are being preserved since the 9th century...... Saint Corona is especially venerated in Austria and Bavaria as the patron-saint of treasure hunters and against epidemics. Her feast day is May 14.The Gloria TV article provided no sources to support the claim, but the rumor was picked up by several popular Catholic websites and even the Diocese of Lansing, Michigan. When we searched for more information about St. Corona, however, we found the claim of a ""patron saint of plagues"" is a modern invention that only started to circulate in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.¬†Catherine M. Mooney, president of the Hagiography Society, and¬†associate professor of Church History, Boston College, School of Theology and Ministry,¬†confirmed to us via email that St. Corona was not known as the patron saint of pandemics.Mooney writes:¬†There are literally many thousands of saints. Along with those who actually existed, there are many more that have simply appeared in legends over the centuries, often made up out of whole cloth. Online web sites on saints are notorious for repeating legendary information.The short answer to your question: Saint Corona has not been known as the patron saint of pandemics, at least not until someone (but who?) recently named her thus. That moniker must have been given her because her name ""Corona,"" which means crown, could connect her to the coronavirus.We found several mentions of St. Corona in articles published over the years, but it wasn't until March 2020 that she became connected to pandemics, plagues, or contagious disease.¬†In 2008, for instance, St. Patrick Catholic Church in Washington, D.C., mentioned St. Corona in its ""Saint of the Day"" column. This article did not identify St. Corona as the ""patron saint of plagues."" Rather, it noted St. Corona was a martyr who was killed along with her husband, St. Victor, circa A.D. 176.St. Patrick Catholic Church also noted that accounts of Corona's death may not be reliable: ""Died c. 176. Saint Victor and his wife Corona were martyred, probably in Syria. The details of their martyrdom as compiled in their Acta are untrustworthy (Benedictines). In art, Victor and Corona are portrayed as they are ripped asunder between trees (Roeder).""The website Catholic.org provides a similar account of St. Corona's death, writing that she and her husband were put to death during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, but that accounts of their deaths are considered unreliable. This website also noted that Corona was often invoked ""in connection with superstitions involving money, such as gambling or treasure hunting,"" not pandemics or plagues.¬†A 1929 edition of the Battle Creek Enquirer,¬†a newspaper from Battle Creek, Michigan, identified St. Corona as the ""wife of an Syrian Christian"" who was put to death because of her faith. This clipping made no mention of her being the patron saint of plagues:¬†¬†¬†Antonio Borrelli, former director of Catholic Action in the Diocese of Naples, wrote a fuller account of St. Corona in 2006.¬† According to Borrelli, she was actually the wife of one of Victor's comrades. When Victor was being tortured for his faith, Corona declared that she, too, was a Christian, and was martyred beside him:According to the ""Illustrious Certamen"", a text written by a deacon of the Church of Antioch in the 4th century, Vittore was a Christian soldier from Cilicia. During the persecution of Marcus Aurelius, he was reported to the prefect Sebastiano and subjected to torture.While he was suffering, while remaining serene in faith, the wife of one of his comrade in arms, whose name was Corona (Latin equivalent of the name Stefania), who was not yet sixteen years old, declared that she too was Christian and encouraged her . She was arrested and subjected to a brief interrogation, after which she was tied by the feet to the tops, folded on the ground, of two palm trees, and quartered alive. Vittore, however, was beheaded.Borrelli notes that accounts of Corona's death aren't entirely reliable because details (such as the date and location) vary depending on the source. But nowhere in Borrelli's article is Corona identified as the patron saint of plagues or pandemics.In one depiction of Corona's death, she is seen tied between two trees while Victor is beheaded in front of her:We found several articles about St. Corona prior to March 2020, but none of these articles identified her as the patron saint of plagues. It appears that is a modern title that was unofficially bestowed upon St. Corona after the coronavirus spread around the globe.¬†Candida Moss, Edward Cadbury Professor of Theology at the University of Birmingham, also disputed this rumor on Twitter. Moss wrote that while St. Corona really existed, she is not the patron saint of infectious disease.¬†While St. Corona was not known as a patron saint of pandemics, Mooney noted that there have been other saints associated with plagues and infectious diseases, including St. Sebastian, St. Roch, St. Nicholas of Tolentino, and St. Rosalia.¬†Mooney also informed us that there isn't really an official process for a saint to become a ""patron"" of one particular subject:¬†Another point: a pope or some other church authority may occasionally name someone a patron of this or that, but there is no process for this to happen. Pope Pius XII named St. Clare of Assisi (d. 1253) as the patron saint of television owing to the fact that it is reported she once had a vision. Lots of saints, or alleged saints, are named patrons of one thing or another by anyone - and then the title sometimes sticks.In short: A saint named Corona, who was martyred sometime in the 170s, truly existed, but accounts about her death aren't entirely reliable. While Corona has been invoked in connection to ""superstitions involving money, such as gambling or treasure hunting,"" her connection to infectious disease did not start until March 2020 when a virus that shared her name started spreading around the globe."	false
2436	A widely circulated image on social media depicted the nerves that run from the human brain, across the face, and into each individual tooth.	Ever wonder why the pain from a toothache doesn‚Äôt seem to just stay in the tooth? A photo shared to social media offers an intricate look at how closely nerves originating in the human brain extend around the face and spread down to each individual tooth.The image in question was popularized in November 2021 when it was shared to Reddit, but had been shared to social media in the years prior by doctors and dentists alike.And it‚Äôs true and authentic. The image was created by Anatomy Next, a medical publishing company that specializes in printed books and digital software and depicts the nerve connections between the brain and the teeth.Nerves that end in each individual tooth originate from the maxillary nerve, which stems from the trigeminal nerve, a mixed nerve bundle made of both motor and sensory fibers that extends around the brain and over the entire face. The trigeminal nerve provides sensory innervation in the oral and nasal cavities, as well as the ear, conjunctiva (mucous membrane that covers the front of the eye), and the skin of the face, according to Anatomy Next.Making up the second branch of the trigeminal nerve, the maxillary nerve provides sensory information to the central nervous system from the teeth of the upper jaw, the upper lip and check, and the middle parts of the face.Sources‚ÄúThe Nerves That Innervate the Teeth.‚Äù R/Interestingasfuck, 15 Nov. 2021, www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/quob1w/the_nerves_that_innervate_the_teeth/.Maxillary Nerve (CN V2). https://anatomy.net/maxillary-nerve-cn-v2.

4035	A Texas resident created a Halloween skeleton strip club in her yard for Halloween.	"In late October 2020, Snopes readers inquired about news stories circulating online reporting on an unusual Halloween yard display. Texas resident Angela Nava had arranged multiple skeletons in her yard to create a detailed ""skeleton strip club,"" complete with pole dancers, patrons, and a bouncer.Our attempts to reach Nava by phone and via social media messages were unsuccessful, however the display is real, as demonstrated by images posted by local television news outlets that covered the story:Nava told Houston's KTRK-TV that she dubbed her Halloween set-up ""the Candy Shop.""""Every night we change the positions of the skeletons, or who's joining the club, or just different participants, and it's really been just a very great creative outlet for me,"" she said in a remote interview with the TV station. ""And it just all started because of COVID [the COVID-19 pandemic]. You know, we've all been cooped up, and it's been such a terrible year, right? And we just decided, if this brings a little bit of joy, and a little bit of smiles to someone, then we're doing everything right.""She said she changes up the scene every night, which draws her neighbors out to see what the new set-up is.Pictures of the display posted to Nava's Facebook page show a flare for humor. She has a skeleton bouncer with a list of names of club patrons. Some of the skeleton patrons are holding up dollar bills for the neon-haired skeleton strippers.Nava told KTRK that she received a letter from her homeowner's association (HOA) telling her to remove the display because it was ""inappropriate"" for a ""family neighborhood."" But the HOA gave her 30 days to do so, and by that time, Halloween will be over. She said she thought about complying right away, but now plans to leave it up until after Halloween because the response has been so positive."	true
5447	The news media ignored the Young Black Leadership Summit event held in Washington, D.C., in October 2018.	"The ""Liberal Privilege"" Facebook group attempted to cast African-American conservatives as the objects of media bias with a claim that news outlets had ignored the Young Black Leadership's October 2018 summit in Washington, D.C.  ""Liberal Privilege"" posted a photograph taken at the Young Black Leadership Summit event along with the caption ""Largest gathering of black conservatives in history -- Media silent"":While we cannot gauge whether this event was truly the ""largest"" gathering of black conservatives ever, the notion that the news media ignored it does not hold up.Hosted by conservative activist group Turning Point USA, the event drew media attention following a address delivered to attendees by President Donald Trump on 26 October 2018. That event was covered by national news outlets such as NBC News, the Washington Post, USA Today, and the New York Post.Additional coverage was provided by the UK's Guardian and African-American-oriented news sites such as NewsOne and The Root, among others."	false
4685	A San Francisco mural portrait of Greta Thunberg used 700 gallons of spray paint.	"In November 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about widely shared social media posts claiming irony or hypocrisy at work in the production of a massive San Francisco mural in honor of the young climate activist Greta Thunberg.¬†On Nov. 8, the right-leaning social media activist Brandon Straka tweeted a link to a KPIX-TV article about the mural, adding his own view that, ""The leftist geniuses in San Francisco have decided to send a message about climate change by creating a 6 story [sic] mural of Greta Thunberg using 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.""The leftist geniuses in San Francisco have decided to send a message about climate change by creating a 6 story mural of Greta Thunberg using 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint. ? https://t.co/LdJj2i3j99‚Äî Brandon Straka (@BrandonStraka) November 9, 2019¬†The text of Straka's tweet, and screenshots of it, were further promulgated by multiple users on Facebook. The KPIX-TV article to which he linked did not contain any reference to the paint used by Argentinian artist Andr√©s Pereoselli (known as ""Cobre"") in creating the Thunberg mural. As such, it did not provide any evidence to support Straka's key claim, that the portrait of the climate activist required 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.¬†It's not clear where that figure came from, but it might have originated in an article on the right-leaning website The Blaze, which wrote:""While it is unclear how many spray cans [Cobre] has used, the mural spans four stories and at least one smaller project utilized 500 cans of the paint scientists say can generate asthma-inducing smog.""The Daily Wire, another right-leaning website, subsequently extrapolated that ""the Thunberg mural¬†will likely take closer to 700 cans to finish.""In response to concerns about the use of aerosol spray paint, One Atmosphere, a California environmental non-profit group that collaborated with Cobre on the mural, posted the following explanation to Instagram on Nov. 11:Some folks have been asking about the environmental impacts of the Greta mural. Read on for some details. The vast majority of the paint is water-based acrylic exterior paint that was rolled onto the building by hand. The finishing details can only be done with spray paint, but we are using spray cans without CFCs. (CFCs are tremendously damaging to the environment). We are using low pressure cans with a minimal footprint. The cans and the boxes will also be recycled, although many of the cans will first have a second life as part of a separate art project.The cans have been picked up and delivered in an electric vehicle, and the artist and organizers have been travelling almost exclusively by way of electric car, electric scooter or on foot to the project site. The lift being used is also electric, not diesel. We are doing our best to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, in that order!After the completion of the project, One Atmosphere's Executive Director Paul Scott provided further details to Snopes in an email. He firmly rejected the claim that the project required 700 gallons, or even 700 cans, of spray paint.In reality, Scott said he counted a total of 117 used 400-ml cans of spray paint, almost all of them from the MTN 94 brand. That's just over 12 gallons in total. However, only some of that 400-ml capacity is taken up by the hydrocarbon propellant that escapes into the atmosphere (as opposed to the liquid paint, which ends up on the side of the building).¬†All aerosol spray paints use a propellant to help disperse the paint from the can and onto its intended surface. In the past, manufacturers used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals that were widely banned from the late 1980s onwards due to the fact that they deplete the ozone layers in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.¬†In the United States in 2019, spray paint manufacturers use hydrocarbons such as propane and butane as propellants. Unlike CFCs, hydrocarbons don't have a deleterious effect on ozone, but they do have a small effect on global warming. However, it's worth putting the scale of that effect into some context, using a measure known as Global Warming Potential.¬†As the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explains on its website:""The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period.""The CFCs used as propellants in aerosol paint in the past have a GWP of between 5,000 and 14,000. Propane, a hydrocarbon commonly used now as a propellant in spray paint, has a GWP of 4. In his email to Snopes, Scott added that, ""The amount of the propellant is also less because the cans are lower pressure, and obviously only a portion of each can is propellant, so the ultimate GWP impact of the cans we used is very limited."""	false
2479	Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump's former adviser, was the first person to be charged by the Justice Department for contempt of Congress since 1983.	"On November 12, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that Steve Bannon, who served as White House chief strategist and senior counselor to the president at the start of U.S. President Donald Trump's term, was indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress after he failed to honor a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee as part of their investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.¬†Bannon, 67, is charged with one contempt count involving his refusal to appear for a deposition and another involving his refusal to produce documents, despite a subpoena from the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol. An arraignment date has not yet been set in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.As this news circulated on social media, many people noted that Bannon was the first person to be indicted by a grand jury on contempt of Congress charges in nearly 40 years. Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard, wrote on Twitter: ""Bannon‚Äôs is the first indictment for criminal contempt of Congress in nearly 40 years. It was well earned.""Legal analyst Elie Honig made a similar observation on CNN:¬†While the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate both have the power to certify contempt citations, it is up to the DOJ to pursue criminal prosecution. The Congressional Research Services writes: ""The criminal contempt statute permits a single house of Congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena.""The House and Senate have both voted in recent years to hold various people in contempt of congress ‚Äî such as former Attorney General William Barr, former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and former Attorney General Eric Holder ‚Äî but it hasn't been since 1983 that the DOJ indicted someone (in that case, Rita M. Lavelle, a former Environmental Protection Agency official) for contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify about the EPA's hazardous waste cleanup fund. While Lavelle was later cleared of this charge, she was later found guilty of perjury.The New York Times writes: ""The last person charged with criminal contempt of Congress, Rita M. Lavelle, a former federal environmental official under President Ronald Reagan, was found not guilty in 1983 of failing to appear at a congressional subcommittee hearing. She was later sentenced to prison for lying to Congress.""To find the last person found guilty of contempt of Congress charges, you have to go back another decade to 1974, when G. Gordon Liddy, a Watergate conspirator, was convicted of the charge.¬† 10 May 1974, Fri Press-Telegram (Long Beach, California) Newspapers.comBannon is the first person to be indicted on contempt of Congress charges since 1983, and he could become the first person to be found guilty of those charges since 1974. The DOJ noted in its release that ""all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."" If Bannon is found guilty, he'll face a maximum sentence of one year in jail for each charge.¬†Each count of contempt of Congress carries a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail, as well as a fine of $100 to $1,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors."	true
2680	In mid-September 2021, the National Health Service in England announced the world‚Äôs first trial for a new cancer-detecting blood test.	"In September 2021, British health officials announced the launch of the world‚Äôs largest trial of a blood test capable of detecting more than 50 types of cancer before symptoms appear.¬†Headed by The Cancer Research UK, the National Health Service (NHS) in England, and King‚Äôs College London, the so-named Galleri trial aims to recruit 140,000 volunteers across eight areas of England. Galleri checks for the earliest signs of cancer. If it's successful, its ability to catch cancer during its earliest stages could be a ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù in the fight against the disease.¬†‚ÄúThis quick and simple blood test could mark the beginning of a revolution in cancer detection and treatment here and around the world,‚Äù said NHS Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard in a news release. ‚ÄúBy finding cancer before signs and symptoms even appear, we have the best chance of treating it and we can give people the best possible chance of survival.‚ÄùWhile its early cancer detection ability holds promise, Galleri does not diagnose cancer and does not detect all forms of the disease. Blood drawn from a participant is tested for chemical changes in fragments of the blood‚Äôs genetic code known as cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which leaks from tumors into the bloodstream. Previous research conducted by Galleri founding company Grail showed that the test was effective at finding cancers that are difficult to identify early on, like head and neck, bowel, lung, pancreatic, and throat cancers.¬†As of this writing, Galleri is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but was granted a breakthrough device designation in 2019 under a government-led¬†voluntary program for certain medical devices ""that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions."" The test joins two other similar tumor-testing tests that were approved in the U.S., according to the consumer publication Evaluate. Galleri is available in the U.S. for $949, and is available for prescription only. Because it is new to the market and does not have FDA approval, the test is not covered by health insurance.¬† Galleri is designed to detect more than 50 types of cancer. Grail¬†Galleri doesn‚Äôt rule out cancer, but instead helps providers to evaluate and confirm whether and where cancer may exist. It is intended to be used in coordination with other screening practices and is not a replacement but rather a method to inform the next steps of diagnosis.¬†For the British trial, tens of thousands of recruitments between the ages of 50 and 77 ‚Äî those most at risk for cancer ‚Äî will be asked to give blood samples at mobile testing clinics across the country. Regardless of their results, the test is designed to detect cancer signals such as cfDNA and predict where in the body those signals exist. Half of the participants in the randomized control trial will have blood samples screened with the test right away, while the other half will have their sample stored and tested in the future. This will allow researchers to compare the stage at which cancer is detected between the two groups. Regardless, study participants will be notified if their test signals potential cancer.¬†Early cancer detection during stage one or two allows for more treatment options, some of which can be less aggressive and harmful. Patients whose cancer is identified at the earliest stage may see up to ten times the survival rate compared to a person who learned of cancer at stage four.¬†Those who give blood as part of the British trial will be invited to participate in later stages of the trial one and two years later. Initial results are expected by 2021 and if successful, researchers plan to extend the rollout to 1 million people by 2025.¬†Sources‚ÄúGRAIL Announces Significant Progress with Multi-Cancer Early Detection Test Including FDA Breakthrough Device Designation.‚Äù GRAIL, https://grail.com/press-releases/grail-announces-significant-progress-with-multi-cancer-early-detection-test-including-fda-breakthrough-device-designation/.

349	A pro-Russian demonstration took place in Poland on June 4, 2023.

On that day in 2023, a vast, anti-governmental demonstration¬†also took place in Warsaw. However, it had nothing to do with supporting Russia and its invasion of Ukraine, as some social media users suggested.¬†The main demonstration was led by¬†Donald Tusk, former Polish prime minister and leader of the the Civic Platform (PO) opposition party.

6032	"Matt Damon announced in March 2018 that he was moving his family to ""a safe place"" in Australia because he was fed up with President Donald Trump and his policies."	"American celebrities often claim they are going to move out of the country because they disagree with national policy, and are generally met with a hearty ""good riddance."" So when the¬†New York Post¬†reported in March 2018 that actor Matt Damon was moving his family to ""a safe place"" in Australia because he was fed up with the Trump administration, the article quickly gained traction in conservative circles.This claim, however, is based on unconfirmed reports from questionable sources, and more importantly has already been debunked by the actor's publicist.¬†The New York Post¬†report was based in large part on a speculative article published a few days earlier by the¬†Daily Telegraph,¬†which reported that Matt Damon¬†might¬†be moving to Australia. That report made no mention of the Trump administration, instead arguing that Damon's close relationship with Australian Chris Hemsworth was the driving force behind the the actor's alleged decision to purchase a home in Byron Bay.The¬†Daily Telegraph's¬†headline may have stated that Damon was ""in the process"" of buying a house in Australia, but the actual language of the article made it clear that this claim was based on speculation and rumor (emphasis ours):Jason Bourne star Matt Damon, close friend to Byron local Chris Hemsworth, is said to be in the process of buying a property near Hemsworth‚Äôs Broken Head pad.Damon, his wife Luciana Barroso and their four children visited Byron last April and returned for a New Year‚Äôs Eve party at the Hemsworth‚Äôs.

4072	"A list of public figures posted to Facebook was part of an ""unsealed"" list of names kept by Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of minors by Jeffrey Epstein."	"In early August 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a widely seen Facebook post containing dozens of names of political and public figures alongside sexual-misconduct accusations against them ‚Äî and the claim that the names represented an ""unsealed"" list¬† maintained by Ghislaine Maxwell, a long-time associate of billionaire financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.""Giselle Maxwell's list became unsealed some time yesterday and here's what happened while everyone was strategically distracted by the covid bullsh*t,"" the message of the Facebook post read, misspelling Maxwell's first name. ""Shows connection to Epstein over the years.""The list contains the names of familiar men, such as Virginia State Sen. Joe Morrisey, disgraced former Subway ad spokesman Jared Fogle, and film director Roman Polanski. The cases listed are not connected to each other or to the Epstein case, but instead are a compilation of (mostly) influential men who have been accused and/or convicted of sexual misconduct.Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on sex-trafficking charges and committed suicide in jail while awaiting trial. The billionaire financier and previously convicted sex offender was accused of trafficking girls to be victimized by some of the most powerful people in the world. Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend, was arrested on related charges in July 2020; prosecutors claim she facilitated Epstein's sexual abuse of minors.Because Epstein and Maxwell associated with the world's political and celebrity elite, their activities have been the subject of public fascination and rumor.It's true that a federal judge made public previously sealed court documents from a defamation lawsuit against Maxwell filed by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre; among the documents were transcripts from a 2016 deposition given by Giuffre. But the unsealed documents, which were uploaded from the federal court records database PACER and posted online by the legal news website Law & Crime, don't contain the list of names in the Facebook post."	false
1273	Crocodile bile is a deadly poison.	"An example of this rumor was collected via email in January 2015:Is crocodile bile a poison? Numerous news articles state that over a hundred people were killed at a funeral when beer was spiked with crocodile bile.When dozens of mourners at a funeral in Tete, Mozambique, passed away after drinking a contaminated batch of phombe in January 2015, speculation arose that the local homemade beer had been spiked with poisonous crocodile bile:The beer, known as ""phombe"", is traditionally served at functions in Mozambique's Tete province. Deaths from drinking it are rare, correspondents say.Carle Mosse, the province's health director, said it was suspected that the poisoning had been caused by crocodile bile although this had yet to be confirmed in tests.It was not immediately clear how the beer had been contaminated and whether it was intentional.The woman who brewed the beer and several members of her family were among the victims, Radio Mozambique has reported.Stories about the supposedly poisonous powers of crocodile bile have been circulating for decades. According to Professor N.Z. Nyazema of the Department of Clinical Pharmacology at the University of Zimbabwe, witches in the 1800s were accused of using bile from the gall bladders of crocodiles to make a poison known as nduru. Nyazema penned an article titled ""Crocodile bile, a poison: myth or reality?"" for Central African Journal of Medicine in 1984 explaining how the poison may have been used:It is widely believed that the bile from the gall bladder of a crocodile is very poisonous. The bile nduru is used as poison which is added to beer or stiff porridge, sadza, of an unsuspecting victim. It is not easy to buy this poison neither is it easy for anyone to kill a crocodile solely for the purpose of obtaining the bile. But with a good fee one can obtain some of the poison from a special nanga [a traditional healer of the Zimbabwean Shona tribe]. At times the nanga may undertake to poison the victim thus adding mystery to the ingredients of the poison. It is reported that the poisoning occurs at special occasions like beer drinking: The nduru is said to be introduced into the beer by dipping the finger or nail where a small amount is placed: This will suffice for the purpose. The unfortunate victim is supposed to die within 24 hours. The poison is supposed to manifest itself when the patient develops pains mainly in the abdomen.While Professor Nyazema's account mirrors the events that transpired in Mozambique in January 2015 (with the notable exception the above-quoted article references the poisoning of a single person while the events in Mozambique would have required enough poison for close to one hundred people), the lethal powers of crocodile bile have yet to be proved. In fact, after learning about nduru, Nyazema conducted his own tests to determine the toxicity of crocodile bile: Using ten crocodile gall bladders, twenty mice, and a baboon, the professor determined the bile of a crocodile was not particularly lethal.Hans Dieter Neuwinger came to a similar conclusion in his book African Ethnobotany: Poisons and Drugs: Chemistry, Pharmacology, Toxicology, writing that crocodile bile was ""virtually non-poisonous."" Additionally, a study presented at the World Crocodile Conference in 2013 concluded freeze-dried crocodile bile was safe for human consumption:For high efficacy of crocodile bile product, acute effects of freeze-dried crocodile bile were performed on male Sprague Dawley rats. The result showed that morbidity and mortality have not found any in treatment 300 mg/kg group of rats. Because of recommendation dose in human is 25 mg/60kg/day, there is very less than in the rat treatment. These revealed that freeze dried crocodile bile is appropriate for product development to be supplementary food in the future.Furthermore, Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said it is not uncommon for locals to add bile to poor quality beer:The use of bile is not uncommon in the production of local or poor quality beer but is not known to be toxic to the extent this outbreak shows.If crocodile bile really is as harmless as professor Nyazema, researcher Hans Dieter Neuwinger, and WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier make it out to be, then where did this fear begin?

2122	A video shared to TikTok in July 2022 authentically showed the sinking of the Titanic.	"More than a century after the infamous sinking of the RMS Titanic, which resulted in the death of more than 1,500 passengers, the internet continues to obsess over the tragedy. Case in point: July 2022, a fake video shared to TikTok that claimed to show the sinking of the cruise liner racked up nearly a half-million likes.A caption accompanying the video read, ‚ÄúRare footage of the 1912 sinking of the Titanic.‚Äù However, the video is a fake. Titanic left its port of Southhampton, England, for its transatlantic maiden voyage on April 10, 1912. Four days later, the nearly 900-foot vessel collided with an iceberg near Newfoundland, Canada, at 11:40 p.m. Two hours and 40 minutes later, the vessel broke in two and sank, according to the Titanic Inquiry Project. Because many of its passengers were noteworthy individuals, the sinking of Titanic quickly became one of the first international news stories of the 20th-century ‚Äî and along with it came a slew of misinformation, notes the Titanic Newspaper Archives.Apparently, that legacy of misinformation has followed the wreckage 110 years later.The room that appears in the video presumably contains the Grand Staircase, which was described as ‚Äúone of the most impressive features on board the RMS Titanic and the center of first-class activity.‚Äù James Cameron‚Äôs 1997 film classic ""Titanic"" resurfaced the fame of the centerpiece. Back to the TikTok video. How do we know that is is fake? First, listen to the audio. You can hear dramatic screaming in the background, but there are no visible people in the frames.Let‚Äôs also mention that handheld video cameras weren‚Äôt a thing in 1912. Sure, cameras in the 1910s were more mobile than those of previous decades, but The Living Image vintage camera museum notes that ‚Äúcameras of this era [were] still mainly of wooden, folding construction‚Äù ‚Äî heavy and not easily mobile. There is surprisingly little genuine film footage of the Titanic both right before and after the disaster, but it does exist. British Path√© was a producer of newsreels throughout the 20th century, reported the pop-science website IFLScience. A six-minute newsreel produced in the aftermath of the disaster spans multiple scenes after the vessel sunk and the ensuing search for survivors. The first scenes from the footage below depict the Titanic as it left port for disaster.As you can see, authentic film footage from 1912 is much different than the clips shared to TikTok.Lastly, we checked the Instagram account associated with the TikTok profile. It led us to a person presumably named Taylor Tituss, who has a description in the profile reading, ‚ÄúI make video edits for fun.‚Äù ""So, to clear things up, the video is fake,"" Tituss told Snopes, adding that he took the footage from a YouTube clip posted to the platform in May 2021. A caption accompanying the video, which had over 1.5 million views as of this writing, claimed the following: Mr Joseph Davies a 17 year old boy who was a Photographer on the Titanic the day it perished down in the Atlantic ocean in 1912.This footage was recovered in 2020 by a historian Investigating the sinking of the titanic.He commented ""A camera was found in the Atlantic ocean where the titanic sits to rest. It was a miracle the camera was still intact after it was found in 1989.""""After years and years of trying to recover the footage found in the films, they were unsuccessful until in 2020 when they became successful recovering the footage using state of the art technology.""Mr Joseph died during the sinking of the titanic, the end bit where the video cuts out is when Mr Joseph drowned to his death trying to capture the sinking of the titanic. His remains were never found.We previously fact-checked the claim that an ""old camera"" from the Titanic was found deep in the ocean. That's also false, as is the below video:As we previously reported, a young girl named Bernice Palmer did capture photographs of the iceberg  that Titanic collided with, as well as images of survivors. The Natural Museum of American History published that Palmer carried a handheld camera on the ship that responded to the Titanic‚Äôs distress call:In 1900, the Eastman Kodak Company came out with the handheld box camera known as the ‚ÄúBrownie.‚Äù An immediate hit, more than 100,000 were sold in its first year. Canadian Bernice ‚ÄúBernie‚Äù Palmer received a Kodak Brownie box camera, either for Christmas 1911 or for her birthday on January 10th, 1912.In early April, Bernie and her mother boarded the Cunard liner Carpathia in New York, for a Mediterranean cruise. Carpathia had scarcely cleared New York, when it received a distress call from the White Star liner Titanic on 14 April. It raced to the scene of the sinking and managed to rescue over 700 survivors from the icy North Atlantic. With her new camera, Bernice took pictures of the iceberg that sliced open the Titanic‚Äôs hull below the waterline and also took snapshots of some of the Titanic survivors.We've looked into a number of rumors and claims surrounding the sinking of Titanic (did we mention that the internet is obsessed?).

3579	On December 25, residents of the Chumbivilcas Province of Peru settle grudges with an annual tradition of fist fights known as Takanakuy.	Every year on December 25, inhabitants of the Chumbivilcas Province of Peru gather for a festival. But you won't find Christmas lights or eggnog. Instead, residents gather for Takanakuy, an annual tradition where residents settle their differences with a public fist fight.¬†A viral meme sums up the basics of the tradition:The content in this meme is accurate.Takanakuy is a tradition in this region of Peru that features people settling their differences in order to start the year anew. The picture included in this meme was taken by Julio Angulo and shared to Flickr in December 2012 along with the following caption (translated via Google):Feast of the fists in the heights of Chumbivilca - Cusco - Peru.Protected by his ski mask, Fernando Huaman√≠ feels the bravest of all Chumbivilcanos. For this year he has challenged Ricardo Ugarte to fight in the Santo Tom√°s bullring, the heart of the province of Chumbivilcas. It will be in public and without anyone intervening, unless their lives are in danger.The challenge was met on December 25 at one in the afternoon. They were not the only ones who defended their honor and the name of their family with a bare fist, because that day at least 40 people also did so in the traditional Takanakuy, a pagan-religious festival in which the inhabitants of this Cusco province put to the test his bravery, fitness and courage. And sometimes also his most hidden hatreds and rancor.In Cusco, every December 25 and 26, men, women, and children fight each other to settle rivalries or simply win the respect and admiration of their neighbors. They do it spontaneously, following an ancient tradition.Suemedha Sood wrote about Takanakuy, which also involves music, dancing, drinking and other more commonplace festivities, for the BBC in 2012:Each year, the Peruvian province of Chumbivilcas hosts the vibrant Christmastime festival of Takanakuy. High up in the Andes Mountains, at an elevation of around 3,600m in the well-known Cusco region, communities get together for celebrations involving music, dancing, drinking, eating and brightly coloured costumes. It‚Äôs much like any number of festivals in Latin America ‚Äì except this holiday gathering culminates with a series of public fist fights on Christmas Day (25 December).Entire towns congregate around sporting arenas to watch members of the community fight each other. People of all ages enter the ring, from young children to the elderly, and participation is open to women and men alike. The purpose of Takanakuy is to settle grievances built up over the year -- be they civil disputes or personal ones -- in a public forum.Takanakuy, which translates to ‚Äúwhen the blood is boiling‚Äù in Quechua (the primary language in the region), is a sort of more organized version of the comical ‚ÄúFestivus‚Äù, a holiday that most people believe was invented by the 1990s US TV sitcom Seinfeld.A reporter from Vice Magazine traveled to Peru to experience Takanakuy back in 2012 and spoke to a man named Victor Jaime Mantilla about the tradition. Mantilla said that the fighting helps maintain order in the province and noted that all fights start and end with a hug.¬†Mantilla said:¬†This is a way to maintain order in Chumbivilcas. A lot of districts around here don't have police stations. It's one of the first things they should have in a zone like this, but there's nothing because this is how laws are regulated here ...Before, justice in Chumbivilcas was solely administered by powerful people, people from the community always lost their case. What can I do with a justice like that? I'd rather have my own justice in public ...It's a way for the people to speak up. It's like we solve it here and we start something new, but in peace. That's why Takanakus both starts and ends with a hug. It's an important role of Takanakuy.Here's a video report from Vice about Takanakuy:	true
76	"In a 1989 newspaper ad after a brutal rape and beating in Central Park, Donald Trump called for ""respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law."""	"With former U.S. President Donald Trump appearing in a Manhattan criminal court on April 4, 2023, on arraignment over felony charges, a reader asked Snopes whether Trump took out an ad in four New York newspapers on May 1, 1989, seeking societal change that allegedly would instill ""the fear of retribution by the courts""¬†in criminal suspects.Trump became the first American president to face criminal charges related to¬†alleged hush-money payments¬†to ex-adult film star Stormy Daniels, with whom he allegedly had a sexual encounter. Trump allegedly made the payments weeks before the 2016 presidential election.¬†Seven years later, the Manhattan court indicted him on 34 felony charges.""Is this true?"" the reader asked Snopes, referring to Trump's remarks in the 1989 ad: ""What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law, who wantonly trespass on the rights of others? How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of its citizens by crazed misfits? ‚Äì From a full-page ad placed in four New York City newspapers by Donald Trump, May 1, 1989.""We found the attributed quotes to Trump to be true.Trump placed the ads in four newspapers after the New York police arrested five teens on suspicion of mugging, beating, and raping a white woman in Central Park in Manhattan in April 1989. The accused were Black and Latino youths, aged 14 to 16 years.In the The Daily News ad, for example, with the headline ""BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!"", Trump called for the execution of the ""muggers"" and ""murderers."" During his interview with Larry King on CNN, Trump defended those ads.All five youths, known as the ""Central Park 5,"" were exonerated in December 2002. Subsequently, they won a $40 million judgment in 2014¬†against the city of New York for false convictions. Even after the five accused were exonerated after a DNA match to serial rapist Matias Reyes and his confession of the crimes, Trump refused to apologize for calling for the death penalty against the falsely accused youth.¬†Before, during and after his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump also was accused of making racist remarks aimed at racial and ethnic groups. Those types of¬†controversial remarks¬†had a long history, dating back to the 1970s.¬†On April 4, 2023, the day Trump was arraigned, one of the five people accused in 1989, Yusef Abdus Salaam, who was 15 in 1989, published a similar-looking ad on his Twitter feed ‚Äì ""BRING BACK JUSTICE & FAIRNESS. BUILD A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR HARLEM"" ‚Äì with the comment, ""Over 30 years ago, Donald Trump took out full page ads calling for my execution. On the day he was arrested and arraigned, here is my ad in response.""Salaam's ad calling for justice tried to mirror the language and tone of Trump's 1989 ad.¬†""Here is my message to you, Mr Trump: In response to the multiple federal and state criminal investigations that you are facing, you responded by warning of 'potential death and destruction,' and by posting a photograph of yourself with a baseball bat, next to a photo of Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. These actions, just like your actions leading up to the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, are an attack on our safety. Thirty-four years ago, your full-page ad stated, in all caps: CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS. You were wrong then and you are wrong now. The civil liberties of all Americans are grounded in the U.S. Constitution.""We therefore rate he claim about Trump's quotes in the 1989 ad to be ""True."""	true
570	In a weekly email newsletter to his constituents, Rep. Paul Goser, R-Ariz., promoted a Holocaust-denying website that has published pieces sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.	"On April 17, Media Matters and other outlets reported that U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., promoted a ""pro-Hitler and Holocaust-denying site."" These stories reference a link in the representative's April 16 ""This Week With Gosar"" newsletter to an article titled ""Congressman: Jewish warmongers Nuland & Blinken 'Are Dangerous Fools Who Can Get Us All Killed'"" on the website Veterans Today. Factually, Gosar did link to this article (though the word ""Jewish"" is omitted from its title in Gosar's newsletter):(This Week with Gosar) (Veterans Today)Veterans Today frequently republishes content from Russian state media. The piece Gosar's newsletter linked to is no exception to that editorial strategy. The original article, which first appeared on Kremlin-backed Sputnik, and did not reference ""Jewish warmongers,"" promoted Gosar's comments on Twitter:United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US State Department official Victoria Nuland ""are dangerous fools who can get us all killed,"" warns Paul Gosar, a Republican Representative of Arizona's 9th Congressional district, in a reference to the two officials' warmongering stance on the Ukraine conflict.¬†Though it has¬†a disclaimer that reads ""expressed opinions are NOT necessarily the views"" of Veterans Today, the site is fairly described as a website that has a history of publishing antisemitic, pro-Nazi, and Holocaust denying material. The website has described Ukrainians as ""Goyim Slaves of Zionist Extremism,"" published several defenses of Adolf Hitler, and argued that ""Jewish Zionists"" ‚Äî not Nazis ‚Äî are responsible for the Holocaust.¬†Snopes reached out to Gosar's office to ask if he was aware of the article's Russian origins or of the antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on Veterans Today. By email, Gosar's office provided Snopes a statement that addressed neither question:Congressman Gosar never made any comment relating to Secretary Blinken's or Nuland's faith, which can be blatantly seen in the article. ¬†Any attempt to assert that he did is libelous.¬†Congressman Gosar is well known as one of the top advocates of the State of Israel and a defender of those of the Jewish faith across the world and has regularly been asked to speak to Jewish advocacy groups like the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation. ¬†"	true

On WEF's website, Harari is described as¬†a philosopher, historian, professor, and author of the book ""Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind."" He gives myriad lectures on what it means to be human. The¬†speech¬†from which the Slay article pulled for its article, ""WEF Calls for AI to Rewrite Bible, Create 'Religions That Are Actually Correct,"" was part of the¬†2023¬†Frontiers Forum, a lecture series hosted by Frontiers Media, a publisher of peer-reviewed scientific journals.Second, Harari never ""called"" for AI to write a bible, nor did he suggest that an AI-written bible would inspire ""religions that are actually correct."" Rather, he warned about the potential power of AI to create religious texts and, thus, new religions that could shape humanity for the worse. Here is a verbatim transcription of his remarks:Now, what would it mean for human beings to live in a world where perhaps most of the melodies, images, laws, policies, and tools are shaped by a non-human alien intelligence, which knows how to exploit with superhuman efficiency, the weaknesses, biases, and addictions of the human mind, and also knows how to form deep and even intimate relationships with human beings?¬†In games like chess, no human can hope to beat a computer. What if the same thing happens in art, in politics, economics, and even in religion? [...] Think, for example, about the next U.S. presidential race in 2024, and try to imagine the impact of the new AI tools that can mass produce political manifestos, fake news stories, and even holy scriptures for new cults.¬†Also, in the speech, Harari stated that, while some existing religions assert their texts to be written by non-human intelligence, the advent of an entirely AI-generated tome would be the first case of that assertion being literally and provably true. That comment was not a statement about one religion or another being ""actually correct,"" regardless of their scriptures' origins.Harari said:Religions throughout history claimed that their holy books were written by unknown human intelligence. This was never true before. This could become true very, very quickly, with far-reaching consequences.In other words, Harari's alleged¬†quip about an AI-written religious text leading to ""religions that are actually correct"" was never actually stated. That claim came from a poor paraphrase of his comments."	false
3239	On March 31, 2021, first lady Jill Biden stood in front of a Nazi-inspired flag while giving a speech to farmworkers.	"According to one historian, C√©sar Ch√°vez researched color combinations on cigarette boxes and Nazi flags when deciding on the flag for the farm workers' movement. Other historians argued that the flag colors were chosen partly because that shade of red was inexpensive for printers, while others reported Ch√°vez chose ‚Äúwhite for hope, black for the plight of the workers, and red for the sacrifice that would be required of them.‚Äù Regardless, many experts say associating the flag directly with the Nazi movement is incorrect. On March 31, 2021, first lady Jill Biden visited the Forty Acres in California, a vaccination site and a National Historic Landmark that became the first headquarters of the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), a labor union for farm workers across the country.While there, she urged farmworkers to get vaccinated as well. That day, she was also honoring C√©sar Ch√°vez, a UFW leader and civil rights activist who died in 1993. During her speech, Biden stood in front of a flag that many on social media claimed was Nazi-inspired. This, we learned, was false.The flag behind Biden was the UFW‚Äôs official flag, which was designed in 1962 by Richard Ch√°vez, C√©sar Ch√°vez‚Äô younger brother. The flag depicts an eagle and was inspired by Aztec imagery. According to the UFW website:In 1962, Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta and others founded the National Farm Workers Association, later to become the United Farm Workers. That same year, Richard Chavez designed the UFW Eagle. Cesar told the story of the birth of the eagle. He asked Richard to design the flag, but Richard had problems making an eagle that he liked. Finally, he sketched one on a piece of brown wrapping paper. He then squared off the wing edges so that the eagle would be easier for union members to draw on the handmade red flags that would give courage to the farm workers with their own powerful symbol. Cesar made reference to the flag by stating, ‚ÄúA symbol is an important thing. That is why we chose an Aztec eagle. It gives pride‚Ä¶When people see it they know it means dignity.‚Äù Since that time, the UFW Eagle Mark has become a highly recognizable icon in the union‚Äôs boycott efforts, legislative, proposition campaigns, and a victorious symbol of its successful contract negotiations.A Smithsonian magazine article by Miriam Chawel, author of ‚ÄúThe Union of Their Dreams,‚Äù about the history of the farm workers‚Äô movement did point out that C√©sar Ch√°vez had ‚Äúresearched emblems, including cigarette boxes and Nazi flags, and concluded that the most potent color combination was red, black and white.‚Äù He then ‚Äúpicked the eagle and directed his brother to draw the bird so simply that anyone could easily replicate the symbol.‚ÄùHowever, another account in 1998‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Fight in the Fields‚Äù by Susan Ferriss and Ricardo Sandoval, which was a companion book to the PBS documentary of the same name, described a moment that indicated evoking Nazi imagery was not Richard Ch√°vez‚Äô intention. The book describes how he came up with the design for the eagle and how C√©sar Ch√°vez chose the colors, ‚Äúwhite for hope, black for the plight of the workers, and red for the sacrifice that would be required of them.‚Äù The book described the unveiling of their banner at the first National Farm Worker‚Äôs Association (which would later become the UFW) conference:It was time to unveil the association's banner: a square-edged black eagle in a white circle against a red background. Manuel pulled a cord, tearing aside a sheet of paper that had been covering the flag‚Äîand gasps rippled through the crowd. Some people immediately left in protest because they thought the flag looked ""Communist."" Some thought the eagle design was inspired, half in jest, by the label on Gallo's cheapest wine, Thunderbird. To Richard's astonishment, still others thought the colors echoed that of the Nazi flag of the Third Reich.But experts have largely argued that the flag‚Äôs purported association with the Nazi movement was ridiculous. Lauren Araiza, an associate professor at Denison University, told The Associated Press that in addition to red and black being eye-catching colors, the tone of red used in the flag was inexpensive for printers.Gavriel D. Rosenfeld, a professor of history at Fairfield University who specializes in the history of Nazi Germany, also told The Associated Press that the Nazi-inspiration claims were incorrect.‚ÄúOne source of subtle confusion may be the fact that many Nazi flags featured an eagle with a swastika, the latter being a very geometric shape; the UFW flag also features a very geometrically rendered Aztec-style eagle that could evoke the geometric aspects of a swastika,‚Äù Rosenfeld said. ‚ÄúBut of course, there‚Äôs no swastika on the UFW whatsoever.‚Äù"	false

"On June 10, 2023, social media users shared photographs of a Pride flag draped vertically from¬†the South Portico of the White House between two American flags.

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. 
In early December 2020, social media users shared rumors that the ""head of Pfizer research"" had warned that the drug company's new COVID-19 vaccine would cause sterilization in women.The story was sourced from a blog called Health and Money News and referenced statements made by Michael Yeadon, who is not the head of Pfizer research. Yeadon did work for Pfizer but left the company in 2011, according to his biographical information in the blog ""Lockdown Sceptics,"" to which Yeadon has contributed. His title at Pfizer was vice president and chief scientist for allergy and respiratory.Yeadon and German physician Wolfgang Wodarg sent a letter to the European Medicines Agency, calling on EMA to halt clinical trials of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine in the European Union. In the letter, Wodarg and Yeadon stated that the Pfizer vaccine blocks a protein that is key in the formation of the placenta in mammals, and they claimed that it's possible women who receive the vaccine could become infertile. However, they did not state as fact that the vaccine causes sterility, as the Health and Money News headline suggests.Pfizer announced on Dec. 2, 2020, that it obtained permission from public health officials in the U.K. to begin administering the vaccine. As The Associated Press reported, ""Britain‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommended the vaccine after clinical trials involving tens of thousands of volunteers showed it was 95% effective and turned up no serious side effects. The vaccine is still considered experimental while final testing is done.""We reached out to Pfizer for comment but didn't receive a response in time for publication, although there was no mention of risk of sterility in Pfizer's publicly available study. In a Nov. 20, 2020, press release Pfizer said no significant safety concerns have been observed during vaccine studies.Both Wodarg and Yeadon have spread COVID-19 misinformation in the past. Yeadon falsely claimed in an October 2020 blog post that the ""pandemic is effectively over."" Wodarg falsely claimed in a March 2020 YouTube video that the virus was no more harmful than the seasonal flu."	false
5598	"A warning about ""another friend request"" alerts Facebook users about potential account ""cloning."""	"In October 2018, Facebook users began receiving and sharing a message stating that the sender had received ""another"" friend request from them, and urging recipients to ""check your account"" and send the same message on to other Facebook friends:Hi ... I actually got another friend request from you yesterday ... which I ignored so you may want to check your account. Hold your finger on the message until the forward button appears ... then hit forward and all the people you want to forward too ... I had to do the people individually. Good Luck!This message played on warnings about the phenomenon of Facebook ""pirates"" engaging in the ""cloning"" of Facebook accounts, a real (but much over-hyped) process by which scammers target existing Facebook users accounts by setting up new accounts with identical profile pictures and names, then sending out friend requests which appear to originate from those ""cloned"" users. Once those friend requests are accepted, the scammers can then spread messages which appear to originate from the targeted account, luring that person's friends into propagating malware, falling for phishing schemes, or disclosing personal information that can be used for identity theft.This particular warning suggests the recipient's Facebook account has been targeted for such ""cloning,"" as indicated by the sender's having received ""a second friend request"" from that account.While a warning of this nature could be legitimate, the fact that this exact same message has been spread to untold thousands of Facebook users indicates that it is at worst a scam or hoax, and at best a once well-intentioned warning rendered useless by being uncritically reposted all over Facebook.Clearly, there would be no utility to forwarding this warning to any of your Facebook friends unless you had actually received a second friend request from one of them. Moreover, even if this warning were possibly real, the optimal approach would not be for the recipient to forward it willy-nilly to every single contact on their friends list."	false
5264	The baya weaver bird is the only animal in the world that dies when its mate dies.	"In December 2018, a video purportedly showing a baya weaver bird dying next to its deceased mate went viral on social media, driven by the associated claim that this species of bird is ""the only creature in the entire world which dies when its companion dies"":It's unclear who captured the original video and where it was first posted online. The version shown above was cropped to remove a bit of Chinese text that roughly translated to ""Life cannot be the same as death!"" which leads us to believe that this video was first circulated on a Chinese social media site such as Weibo. The earliest version we could find was published by Pancho Reao on Facebook in October 2018, where it was accompanied by the caption ""Lo m√°s triste que ver√°s hoy!"" or ""The saddest thing you'll see today!""Several reasons prompt us to be skeptical of this clip and the accompanying death claim. First off, male baya weaver birds don't engage in one-on-one relationships as suggested by this video.  Males of this species are polygamous and mate with multiple females, so if this claim were true, then the death of a single male baya weaver would potentially result in the deaths of several females as well.  (In fact, some studies have reported that males and females of this species are polygamous, so the death of any single baya weaver bird would potentially result in the deaths of multiple other birds as well.)Second, this video appears to show two birds of the same sex. Male and female baya weavers have distinctly different coloration, but the birds seen in this video look similar in that regard:Furthermore, this clip doesn't offer any real evidence of its claim.  The video shows one baya weaver bird that is seemingly unwilling to leave the presence of a dead baya weaver bird, then it cuts to a shot of two dead baya weaver birds being buried.  The video doesn't document how the second bird died, however, and the viewer can't even be sure the latter two birds are the same pair seen in the earlier portion of the clip.As we noted above,  while some animals truly form monogamous pairs and mate for life, the baya weaver is polygamous and may mate with a number of different partners. A 1957 report published in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) documented philandering baya weavers of both sexes:It was observed that cocks will surreptitiously attempt to copulate with the hens visiting an absent neighbour's nest, in the same way as they will filch his nesting material. As in the latter case, they flee precipitately upon the owner's return. In one instance, the owner arrived while the act of 'adultery' was in progress. He broke off the pairing and spiritedly chased the intruder, who fitted across and settled on his own nest hard by while the owner himself took overtures to the hen. On the other hand a 'married' female, newly in possession of nest and mate, will sometimes snatch a hasty opportunity to hop across to a neighboring eligible nest (i.e., in the appropriate helmet state) in the momentary absence of its rightful mistress,' deliberately exposing herself to the amorous impetuosity of the 'married' owner, and even inviting and permitting copulation.Thus, while 'progressive polygamy' is now definitely established as the normal procedure in the baya, our observations in the 1956 season provide strong evidence also of fortuitous promiscuity in the sexual relations of both sexes.The polygamous nature of the baya weaver was also noted in a 2016 article from the Indian Express:¬†
‚ÄúThis clever little bird knows 14 to 18 different types of knots,‚Äù says [Siddhesh] Surve, [project assistant at BNHS and organiser of the pan-India survey]. ‚ÄúHe uses them to hold his nest together so that it can resist monsoon storms and hold the weight of his mate and their eggs.‚Äù The bird also makes small mud pellets to weigh the nest down.This might seem like a lot of work, but the female Baya Weaver demands much to be impressed. She jumps from nest to nest for quality inspection before deciding on her mate. But once the male has been selected, he loses interest and and flies off in search of more females almost immediately. His abandoned mate incubates the eggs, which hatch in around two weeks."	false
4217	Donald Trump tweeted that foreigners attending college in the United States who want to stay 'should not be thrown out of our country.'	"More than one critic of U.S. President Donald Trump has observed that Trump seemingly ‚Äúhas a tweet for everything.‚Äù That is, whatever the situation today might be, one can find an old Trump tweet about it ‚Äî or something similar ‚Äî and more often than not, that tweet will be a criticism of how someone else dealt with that situation.That phenomenon came into play again in July 2020, when various news outlets reported that a new Trump administration directive might force many foreign students attending American colleges and universities to return to, or remain in, their home countries:A directive by the Trump administration that would strip international college students of their U.S. visas if their coursework was entirely online prompted widespread confusion as students scrambled to clarify their statuses and universities reassessed their fall reopening policies amid the coronavirus pandemic.The effect may be to dramatically reduce the number of international students enrolling in the fall. Together with delays in processing visas as a result of the pandemic, immigrant advocates say the new rules, which must still be finalized, might discourage many overseas students from attending American universities, where they often pay full tuition.Such changes could put foreign students‚Äô visas, known as F-1 visas, at risk under the new rules. International students whose universities are not planning in-person classes ‚Äî which is currently the case at schools including the University of Southern California and Harvard ‚Äî would be required to return to their home countries if they are already in the United States. Those overseas would not be granted permission to enter the country to take online coursework here.Many commenters on social media were quick to share a tweet purportedly posted by Trump years earlier, in which he declared that ""When foreigners attend our great colleges & want to stay in the U.S., they should not be thrown out of our country"":This was a genuine Trump tweet from August 18, 2015, as seen above. On that same date, Trump also seemingly tweeted his support for policies encouraging foreign students to come the U.S. and establish careers here:But as The New York Times noted, by July 2020 ‚Äî with the coronavirus pandemic looming large as the primary political issue during a presidential election year ‚Äî foreign students appeared to have become a pawn in a re-election campaign:The White House measure [to strip international college students of their U.S. visas] was seen as an effort to pressure universities into reopening their gates and abandoning the cautious approaches that many have announced they would adopt to reduce Covid-19 transmission."	true
3734	Images capture Georgia State Senators counting 2020 general election votes in Pennsylvania	"In the midst of President Donald Trump's flailing attempts to overturn the results of his loss in the 2020 general election by claiming election fraud, supporters on social media circulated images purportedly showing State Senator Elena Parent of Georgia counting votes in Pennsylvania.The images were accompanied by remarks such as ‚ÄúState Senator Elena Parent of Georgia is seen here counting ballots in Pa? Not sure that‚Äôs lawful Senator ...‚Äù and ‚ÄúElena Parent, Democratic Senator, why are you opening ballots and in counting rooms? I didn‚Äôt know a senators job description was to work in election counting rooms?‚Äù: Georgia and Pennsylvania -- both of which were won by Democratic challenger Joe Biden -- were two of the states that Trump repeatedly had targeted with lawsuits and calls to negate their results. Parent,   as member of the Georgia‚Äôs Senate Judiciary Committee, had argued against Trump's claims of voting fraud just a week earlier.The woman pictured counting ballots at the Allegheny County elections warehouse was not Parent, however, who was neither in Pennsylvania on (or after) Election Day, nor counted votes anywhere, as she told the Associated Press:
‚ÄúThese discredited claims are being made because I told the truth to Trump‚Äôs legal team during the election hearing: No ‚Äòevidence‚Äô was being presented to Georgia State Senators that was new, and there is no evidence of widespread fraud in Georgia‚Äôs November election,‚Äù Parent told the AP in an email. ‚ÄúThe allegations are false. I am not depicted in the video or stills,‚Äù Parent explained. ‚ÄúI have not been to Pennsylvania anytime in 2020 and I have never counted ballots in a state or local election.‚Äù
The social media posts appear to feature a woman who bears only a nodding resemblance to Parent.  Here is a photograph of the real Elena Parent, as taken from her Georgia State Senate web page:"	false
919	A student mistook examples of unsolved statistics problems for  a homework assignment and solved them.	"A legend about the ""unsolvable math problem"" combines one of the ultimate academic wish-fulfillment fantasies ‚Äî a student not only proves himself the smartest one in his class, but also bests his professor and every other scholar in his field of study ‚Äî with a ""positive thinking"" motif that turns up in other urban legends: when people are free to pursue goals unfettered by presumed limitations on what they can accomplish, they just may manage some extraordinary feats through the combined application of native talent and hard work:A young college student was working hard in an upper-level math course, for fear that he would be unable to pass. On the night before the final, he studied so long that he overslept the morning of the test.When he ran into the classroom several minutes late, he found three equations written on the blackboard. The first two went rather easily, but the third one seemed impossible. He worked frantically on it until ‚Äî just ten minutes short of the deadline ‚Äî he found a method that worked, and he finished the problems just as time was called.The student turned in his test paper and left. That evening he received a phone call from his professor. ""Do you realize what you did on the test today?"" he shouted at the student.""Oh, no,"" thought the student. I must not have gotten the problems right after all.""You were only supposed to do the first two problems,"" the professor explained. ""That last one was an example of an equation that mathematicians since Einstein have been trying to solve without success. I discussed it with the class before starting the test. And you just solved it!""And this particular version is all the more interesting for being based on a real-life incident!One day in 1939, George Bernard Dantzig, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, arrived late for a graduate-level statistics class and found two problems written on the board. Not knowing they were examples of ""unsolved"" statistics problems, he mistook them for part of a homework assignment, jotted them down, and solved them. (The equations Dantzig tackled are more accurately described not as unsolvable problems, but rather as unproven statistical theorems for which he worked out proofs.)Six weeks later, Dantzig's statistics professor notified him that he had prepared one of his two ""homework"" proofs for publication, and Dantzig was given co-author credit on a second paper several years later when another mathematician independently worked out the same solution to the second problem.George Dantzig recounted his feat in a 1986 interview for the College Mathematics Journal:It happened because during my first year at Berkeley I arrived late one day at one of [Jerzy] Neyman's classes. On the blackboard there were two problems that I assumed had been assigned for homework. I copied them down. A few days later I apologized to Neyman for taking so long to do the homework ‚Äî the problems seemed to be a little harder than usual. I asked him if he still wanted it. He told me to throw it on his desk. I did so reluctantly because his desk was covered with such a heap of papers that I feared my homework would be lost there forever. About six weeks later, one Sunday morning about eight o'clock, [my wife] Anne and I were awakened by someone banging on our front door. It was Neyman. He rushed in with papers in hand, all excited: ""I've just written an introduction to one of your papers. Read it so I can send it out right away for publication."" For a minute I had no idea what he was talking about. To make a long story short, the problems on the blackboard that I had solved thinking they were homework were in fact two famous unsolved problems in statistics. That was the first inkling I had that there was anything special about them.A year later, when I began to worry about a thesis topic, Neyman just shrugged and told me to wrap the two problems in a binder and he would accept them as my thesis.The second of the two problems, however, was not published until after World War II. It happened this way. Around 1950 I received a letter from Abraham Wald enclosing the final galley proofs of a paper of his about to go to press in the Annals of Mathematical Statistics. Someone had just pointed out to him that the main result in his paper was the same as the second ""homework"" problem solved in my thesis. I wrote back suggesting we publish jointly. He simply inserted my name as coauthor into the galley proof.Dr. Dantzig also explained how his story passed into the realm of urban legendry:The other day, as I was taking an early morning walk, I was hailed by Don Knuth as he rode by on his bicycle. He is a colleague at Stanford. He stopped and said, ""Hey, George ‚Äî I was visiting in Indiana recently and heard a sermon about you in church. Do you know that you are an influence on Christians of middle America?"" I looked at him, amazed. ""After the sermon,"" he went on, ""the minister came over and asked me if I knew a George Dantzig at Stanford, because that was the name of the person his sermon was about.""The origin of that minister's sermon can be traced to another Lutheran minister, the Reverend Schuler [sic] of the Crystal Cathedral in Los Angeles. He told me his ideas about thinking positively, and I told him my story about the homework problems and my thesis. A few months later I received a letter from him asking permission to include my story in a book he was writing on the power of positive thinking. Schuler's published version was a bit garbled and exaggerated but essentially correct. The moral of his sermon was this: If I had known that the problem were not homework but were in fact two famous unsolved problems in statistics, I probably would not have thought positively, would have become discouraged, and would never have solved them.The version of Dantzig's story published by Christian televangelist Robert Schuller contained a good deal of embellishment and misinformation which has since been propagated in urban legend-like forms of the tale such as the one quoted at the head of this page: Schuller converted the mistaken homework assignment into a ""final exam"" with ten problems (eight of which were real and two of which were ""unsolvable""), claimed that ""even Einstein was unable to unlock the secrets"" of the two extra problems, and erroneously stated that Dantzig's professor was so impressed that he ""gave Dantzig a job as his assistant, and Dantzig has been at Stanford ever since.""George Dantzig (himself the son of a mathematician) received a Bachelor's degree from University of Maryland in 1936 and a Master's from the University of Michigan in 1937 before completing his Doctorate (interrupted by World War II) at UC Berkeley in 1946. He later worked for the Air Force, took a position with the RAND Corporation as a research mathematician in 1952, became professor of operations research at Berkeley in 1960, and joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1966, where he taught and published as a professor of operations research until the 1990s. In 1975, Dr. Dantzig was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Gerald Ford.George Dantzig passed away at his Stanford home at age 90 on 13 May 2005."	true

6110	"Oxford professor of Islamic studies Tariq Ramadan said ""we are here to colonize the U.S. and Canada"" with Sharia law."	"In mid-February 2018, an inflammatory quote attributed to Tariq Ramadan, a prominent and controversial Islamic studies scholar recently arrested on rape charges in France, reappeared on social media:The Swiss-born scholar has for years has been a controversial figure in part because of his lineage (he is the grandson of¬†Hassan Al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood movement) and in part because of his views on the role of Islam in the Western world.We found no evidence that Ramadan ever made the statement attributed to him above.In 2004, the George W. Bush administration barred Ramadan from entering the U.S. over allegations he had donated to a charity that gives money to the Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist organization Hamas. The restriction on Ramadan's entry was lifted in 2010.In February 2018, Ramadan made headlines for a completely different reason: he was arrested in France after two women came forward with rape allegations against him in late 2017, during what has become known as the #MeToo movement. It's unclear whether the rape charges prompted the fake quote's resurgence, but the latter has wended its way across the Internet by way of message boards and web sites with no links back to a source for it.The quote appears to have originated on the anti-Muslim site BareNakedIslam.com, where it appeared in a 2015 post alongside a video commentary by Marc Lebuis, the founder of a French-Canadian web site whose mission is to ""explore and expose Islamist activities in our midst.""The quote is a mishmash of Ramadan's words and Lebuis's paraphrases. In the video, Lebuis said that ""Tariq Ramadan is very controversial by the way. He called on ‚Äî he specifically targeted Muslims not to use Sharia law, the term Sharia, but rather targeted Canada as being one of the easiest legal systems to penetrate in order to advance Sharia principles. And that was published in an Egyptian magazine in 2004.""LeBuis was referring to a 2004 interview with Ramadan in the Cario-based news magazine Egypt Today, in which Ramadan discussed the Islamic code of conduct enshrined in the law of some predominantly Muslim countries known as Sharia law. The idea of a sneaky takeover plot to implement Sharia law in Western countries such as Canada and the United States is popular among anti-Islamic conspiracy theorists, who have developed a veritable cottage industry around that fear.But Ramadan never¬†said anything about ""colonizing"" the U.S. and Canada or using violent jihad to do so. Rather, he told Egypt Today that:The Muslims in Canada‚Äôs battle to set up shariah courts to settle domestic disputes is another example of lack of creativity. Within the normative law in Canada, they have huge latitude for Muslims to propose an Islamic contract. These courts are not necessary; all they do is stress the fact that Muslims have specific laws and for the time being this is not how we want to be perceived. We need to show that our way of thinking is universal, that we can live with the law and there is no contradiction.It‚Äôs more useful for Muslims to examine the legal framework they have in Canada, which is one of the most open in the world, and come up with something Islamic that at the same time fits the Canadian reality. The term shariah in itself is laden with negative connotations in the Western mind. There is no need to stress that. We can do more and better without creating this sort of fracture and misunderstanding. The very moment Muslims understand there are no contradictions between being Muslim and being European or American, they will enrich their societies.Although Lebuis interpreted Ramadan's comments as pushing for a takeover of the Canadian legal system, the academic was in fact advocating for the opposite, saying that Canadian Muslims could use the existing court system rather than settling disputes in separate Sharia courts. But neither man's comments were sensational enough for BareNakedIslam, which apparently made up a quote that fit their purposes.As the fake quote and stories about the allegations against Ramadan swept far-right sites such as GellerReport.com and ""Creeping Sharia,"" some observers have raised questions about what it means for Muslim women when misogyny and racism collide. Muslim women have been speaking out in their own version of the MeToo movement using the hashtag #MosqueMeToo, telling their stories of assault and abuse within the religious community.Author and activist Mona Eltahawy pointed out in a November 2017 op-ed that the eagerness of Islamophobes to paint Muslim men as predators puts Muslim women in a difficult position when they come forward with accusations of sexual assault. Ayesha Chaudhry, associate professor of Islamic studies and gender studies at the University of British Columbia, discussed that double bind in phone interview with us, saying ""When people are violated and are victims of assault, they can‚Äôt be expected solve systemic inequality at the same time.""Chaudhry said the Ramadan case brought to mind a motif common in stories about crimes committed by Muslim men in the Western media, and noted that once the trial starts, various forms of rarely-discussed societal oppression will play out in public:[University of California, Los Angeles women's studies professor] Sherene Razack makes the argument of this triangle we find ourselves caught in when we talk about Muslims. There‚Äôs the dangerous Muslim man, the imperiled woman and the civilizing European, and you just see this in the Tariq Ramadan case so clearly."	false

Nancy Pelosi (D-California) delivered an eight-hour speech¬†on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives pushing for a vote on DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) in February 2018, dubious web sites claimed that Pelosi's house had a wall around it.

Her home sits atop a twelve-foot-high wall that keeps her well above the riff-raff that are her ultra-wealthy fellow millionaire neighbors.And yet she's against building walls to keep America safe?Gee, kinda sounds a little hypocritical don't you think?¬†Setting aside the disparities between a border wall and a wall around a piece of personal property, there's a much bigger problem with this meme: this isn't Pelosi's house.ÔªøThe pictured property is located at 2724 Pacific Avenue in Pacific Heights, a wealthy area of San Francisco.

However, Pelosi doesn't own it.¬†The confusion likely stems from a virtual tour of the mansion published¬†in¬†Forbes¬†in 2013.

Straight ahead, miles past the adjoining estate owned by the Dolby family (of Dolby Labs), lies the peak of the Transamerica Pyramid; to the left, past Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi's red brick manse, lies the Bay and in it the infamous island of Alcatraz.It's true that Pelosi lives (or lived) in Pacific Heights, but we couldn't find much information about the House Minority Leader's San Francisco home. We did, however, find a few photographs of Pelosi's ""red brick manse"" from a 2007 protest that was staged outside the property.¬†The New York Times¬†reported at the time:¬†Using a tactic usually trained on the home turf of President Bush, a group of protesters from Code Pink, a women's antiwar group, have camped in front of the home of Speaker Nancy Pelosi here, bringing their message - and mattresses - to the doorstep of the nation's highest-ranking Democrat.As far as we can tell, there was no wall separating Pelosi's home from the protesters.¬†Pelosi wasn't the first politician to be called a hypocrite for simultaneously being anti-border wall but pro-home wall. After Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) delivered a rebuttal to Donald Trump's February 2018 state of the union address, a photograph purportedly showing a wall around his Palm Beach home appeared online. In that instance, the pictured house also did not belong to Joe Kennedy ‚Äî although his family did own that home until the future congressman was 14. The wall in the photograph was not a security wall, but a seawall¬†built to protect the oceanfront property from water damage.¬†In January 2019, a similar accusation was made against Pelosi¬†that was centered on her property along the¬†Napa River in California. The creator of that meme was at least able to use a photograph actually showing a Pelosi-owned property. However, the ""wall"" in question was no more than a few feet high, appeared decorative in nature, and only covered the main entrance (it does not surround the entire property).¬†"	false

"On Feb 16, 2022, NBA fans were a bit bewildered when they came across a quote ostensibly uttered by former Boston Celtics player Kevin Garnett about how modern NBA players were ""bums"" for seeking out super teams. Garnett supposedly said: ""Everybody's just running from the grind nowadays, teaming up with each other. Back in my day, we did it the hard way!

He is able to identify, almost flawlessly, orchestral music from Beethoven to the present. He performs this feat by examining the spacing and contour of the grooves on a record; from this examination he can determine how many movements a piece is divided into, how long each movement is, and the relative loudness and percussiveness of the movements.

DACA or shut down the government till Dreamers can vote in midterm elections.Besides losing coherence as it goes along in what we can only describe as sheer laziness, the post spreads a number of falsehoods: first of all, both DREAMers (the term for immigrant youths who would have been covered under the proposed DREAM Act) and enrollees in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program cannot vote. Conservatives have consistently insisted ‚Äî without any¬†proof¬†to back it ‚Äî that Democrats have benefitted from receiving millions of illegal votes, whether it be from undocumented immigrants or African-Americans.Further, the remarks about ""those sort of people"" and veterans having to ""pass their privlage [sic]"" were fabricated.

In March 2020, social media users started sharing clips from the 2018 South Korean television show ""My Secret Terrius,"" which supposedly showed characters using the word ""coronavirus.""¬†This is a real scene from a 2018 show. But while many people may have only heard the word ""coronavirus"" for the first time in 2020, it has been around for decades.Scientists first identified human coronaviruses in humans in the 1960s. Since then, we've seen a few coronavirus outbreaks, such as the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2012 and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2002. In a longer version of this clip, the TV doctor explains how these diseases all come from the same group of viruses:The fictional coronavirus in the show is also rather different from the strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that was spreading around the globe in early 2020. In the show, someone ""tweaked"" the virus in order to make it more deadly. In reality, that simply isn't possible. COVID-19 is not a human-made bioweapon. (You can read about that conspiracy theory's origins and scientific failings here.)The coronavirus in the show also has a 90% mortality rate. While we still have a lot to learn about COVID-19, the disease does not have a 90% mortality rate. The case fatality rate differs from country to country and can be influenced by various factors, such as the availability of supplies at hospitals. In places like Italy, where the outbreak has been severe, the fatality rate has climbed as high as 11%. In places like South Korea, where outbreaks were mitigated with a massive testing program, the fatality rate has been just over 1%.¬†We should also note that some social media users shared clips of ""My Secret Terrius"" along with the claim that this was a ""Chinese"" show. While that may play into the human-made bioweapon conspiracy theory (again, that is a false rumor), this show actually comes from South Korea.¬†In short: A 2018 show South Korean show called ""My Secret Terrius"" does mention the word ""coronavirus."" However, this term predates the show by several decades. Furthermore, the fictional virus does not share the same traits as the strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that was spreading around the world in early 2020.¬†"	false

"In April and May of 2020, whatever portion of the news cycle was not taken up by the COVID-19 pandemic and President Donald Trump's handling of it focused on an accusation made by Tara Reade against presumptive Democratic presidential Joe Biden.  Reade, who worked as a junior staffer in Biden's office in 1993 (while Biden was a senator representing Delaware in the U.S. Congress), claimed in 2019 that back in 1993 Biden had touched her shoulders and neck in a way that made her feel uncomfortable, and then in 2020 claimed that Biden in fact had sexually assaulted her. Biden has unequivocally maintained that the alleged incident ""never happened.""Some social media postings from May 2020 presented a photograph of Biden with a woman and suggested that the pictured woman was Tara Reade, someone whom Biden supposedly asserted he had never met:Such posts were wrong on two fronts.  First, Biden has not maintained that he ""never met"" Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in his Senate office from December 1992 to August 1993 (and it's unclear whether he has even averred that he ""doesn't remember"" Reade).  Second, and more important, although this photograph dates from the correct time period (i.e., January 1993) to potentially be a picture of Biden with Tara Reade, it is actually a photograph of Biden posing with Zo√´ Baird, who had then just been nominated for the position of U.S. Attorney General by President Bill Clinton.

5304	Lululemon is recruiting 150 ambassadors via social media.	"""If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is"" says the manta of the fact-checking industry.In December 2018, a number of social media users came across a post promising a chance at an ambassadorship with the popular brand Lululemon. The posting, which was shared by Instagram accounts such as @lulurecruitment.co (which has no affiliation with the real Lululemon) explained that anyone with 150 followers had a chance of obtaining free clothes and gift for simply sharing this advertisement with their friends on social media:‚Ä¢This is not a genuine offer from Lululemon, and the accounts sharing this message are not affiliated with the brand.Lululemon's social media team has responded to a few queries about the scam with messages similar to the following:FB User: Is this legit? I am assuming noLululemon: Hi Michelle, You've got it‚Äîour accounts are verified with the blue check mark, and our ambassadors are chosen individually by our stores rather than via our social channels. This account has been flagged to our brand protection team. Let me know if you have more questions!
 - CamillaThe non-existent ambassadorship was only offered to users with a minimum of 150 followers, which is a relatively low bar for any sort of social media position, especially for a well-known national brand such as Lululemon. This scam also required potential ""ambassadors"" to follow the fake Lululemon account and then share its post with their friends. This allowed the scammers to build a following and ensured that their dishonest message would be spread to a greater number of social media users.This Lululemon scam followed a strategy similar to other ""like farming"" social media schemes. Such fraudsters offer something of value (in this case an ambassadorship) in exchange for social media engagement, which allows them to quickly build a following and then provides them the opportunity to sell the account to a third party.One way to avoid this type of scam is to double-check to make sure that a company-affiliated post actually originated with the brand's official social media accounts:@lululemon can you confirm if this is real or fake? pic.twitter.com/gnp8g2sD2p‚Äî Jason Davis (@Jasonnn93) December 13, 2018"	false
6250	A Maryland man has been indicted in connection with the Uranium One investigation.	"On 12 January 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an eleven-count indictment against a Maryland man who is accused of bribing a former Russian energy official in a scheme to win nuclear fuel transportation contracts for his company. Although on its face it appears to be a straightforward story of corruption, the indictment has become conflated with one of the most fevered post-election 2016 conspiracy theories ‚Äî Uranium One.Mark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland is facing multiple counts of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), wire fraud, and money laundering. He is accused of scheming to bribe¬†Vadim Mikerin, a former Russian official at TENEX (a subsidiary of Russia‚Äôs State Atomic Energy Corporation, better known as¬†Rosatom) into securing contracts for his firm, identified in court documents as ""Transportation Company A."" Mikerin and Daren¬†Condrey, a third man named in the indictment, both pleaded guilty to related charges in 2015. The 24-page indictment filed on 10 January 2018 in federal court in Maryland makes no mention of the Clintons, their charitable foundation, or Uranium One.According to court documents and Justice Department statements, Lambert and Condrey were co-presidents of the Maryland firm¬†Transport Logistics International whose corruption scheme dates back as early as 2004. Lambert is accused of, and Condrey plead guilty to, conspiring¬†to provide to Mikerin ""kickback payments"" in exchange for defrauding TENEX by ""causing contracts for the shipment of uranium from Russia to the U.S. to be awarded to the U.S. defendants and their companies without having to compete for the contracts.""Lambert's attorney William Sullivan told us, ""We vigorously deny the allegations included in the indictment and look forward to defeating them in court."" He declined to comment further. Lambert is scheduled to be arraigned on 25 January 2018.The conspiracy theory posits¬†that in 2010, Hillary Clinton was bribed in her capacity as Secretary of State into transferring control of a portion of U.S. uranium deposits to the Russian owners of the Canadian mining firm Uranium One in exchange for a donation to the Clinton Foundation. Although it has gained steam both in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election (which Clinton ultimately lost to Republican rival Donald Trump) and one year later amid a special counsel probe of alleged collusion between President Trump's associates and Russia, there is no evidence Clinton was bribed or that she was personally involved in the approval of the sale.Perhaps because the indictment contains the Pavlovian buzzword ""uranium,"" it has been widely reported as being related to the Uranium One deal although no basis in fact has been offered demonstrating how the two cases are related. Other than¬†Rosatom, uranium and a shared witness who was reportedly so unreliable he was dropped from the Justice Department's investigation into Mikerin, no credible evidence of a connection between the Lambert indictment and the Uranium One sale has been made public.The only news outlet we could locate that accurately reported the story was the 135-year-old¬†local newspaper, the Frederick News-Post. Otherwise, nationally-oriented blogs and cable news reported information that they did not bother to support with facts, drawing¬†on the tangential similarities between the two cases and presenting them to their audiences as one and the same, leading many to falsely believe an indictment has been issued in a Uranium One investigation.The first instance we could find of the leap being made from the Uranium One conspiracy to the Lambert indictment was DailyWire.com, a web site owned by right wing commentator Ben Shapiro, which on 12 January 2018 ran the headline ""BREAKING: Indictment Handed Out In Russian Bribery Case Involving Uranium One, Hillary Clinton.""The next day the tabloid-type paper the New York Post reported a similar story. From there, the unfounded story traveled far and wide, picked up by a host of popular right wing blogs like¬†Breitbart.com, Townhall.com and TheBlaze.com. But it was also given a major signal boost by ostensibly more reputable outlets¬†Fox News and The Hill, a news web site that focuses on Capitol Hill. To cap it all off, NewsBusters.com, a web site that claims to seek out and ""bust"" liberal bias in the news media, reported without irony that the major news networks had avoided the baseless story:"	false

2079	Fox News Channel, the conservative cable news organization, has never won a Pulitzer, Emmy, Peabody, or Edward R. Murrow Award for journalism on the merits of its work.	"Though Fox News Channel has not won any of these awards, it is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which also owns the Wall Street Journal. The Journal has won a number of those awards. It is also possible that the channel has not submitted itself for consideration of the awards. Experts tell us that Fox News has always prioritized ratings and popularity over industry recognition. Fox News, the conservative U.S. cable outlet, has frequently been the subject of our fact checks. It's a deeply influential news organization with a high viewership but not necessarily a stellar reputation among other journalistic organizations. On Aug. 17, 2022, an online meme claimed that the news channel had not won any Pulitzers, Peabodys, Emmy, or Edward R. Murrow Awards for journalism.The meme is largely accurate, but misrepresents the context behind how such awards take place, and Fox News' own priorities. We looked into the archives of all the major awards and found no evidence the channel had won anything. Fox News was created in 1996, so it would not have been eligible for awards in the years prior.¬†The Pulitzer Prize, considered the top journalistic award in the U.S., has a number of journalism categories. We looked through each of them over the years and found no evidence of the channel winning anything.¬†However, Paul Gigot of The Wall Street Journal won the award in 2000 for his commentary in the newspaper. Gigot hosts The Journal Editorial Report on Fox News, and in 2007 went on to join the Pulitzer Prize Board. The Fox News Channel also did not win any Peabody awards on its own. However FOX, its parent network, was named among the U.S. broadcast and cable networks as the 2001 winner for ‚ÄúAmerica: A Tribute to Heroes.‚Äù Also produced by Tenth Planet Productions, this show was a relief effort for the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. According to the Peabody committee: ‚ÄúAll involved donated their talent and time, while ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX underwrote costs surrounding the production of this outpouring of honor for those lost on Sept. 11, 2001.‚Äù This award cannot, however, be credited to Fox News Channel specifically. The program was aired live and commercial-free across a range of networks:Bare stages lit with hundreds of candles in New York, Los Angeles, and London provided the somber, unadorned setting for this unique program carried live, commercial free, by more than 30 radio, television and cable networks, including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, PBS, UPN, the WB, BET, Comedy Central, Court TV, the Discovery Channel, E!, Fox Family, FX, HBO, HBO Latino, Lifetime, MTV, PAX, Showtime, Sundance Channel, Telemundo, TLC, TNN, TNT, Univision, and VH-1. A number of Westwood One and Clear Channel Communications radio affiliates also simulcast the special telethon, which raised more than $150 million for the victims of 9/11.Fox News Channel also has not won any Emmy Awards, but was nominated for the first time in 2019 for a News and Documentary Emmy. ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace's interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin gained wide praise and was nominated in the ""Outstanding Live Interview"" category. The winner was CNN International‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmanpour,‚Äù in which Christine Amanpour interviewed the Archbishop of New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan. Fox has not won or been nominated in the years since, though a number of Fox local affiliate stations have frequently done so.¬†¬†The same is true of the Edward R. Murrow Awards. However, national and regional network affiliate stations have won the award over the years.¬†Reece Peck, an assistant professor at CUNY Staten Island and author of ‚ÄúFox Populism: Branding Conservatism as Working Class,‚Äù told us that he was ‚Äúnot surprised‚Äù by the organization‚Äôs lack of journalism awards.¬†[Fox News‚Äô] founding brand was that it was the counter-elite network. This draws from the playbook that Rupert Murdoch [their founder]¬†had been using from the fifties in Australian and British news markets. He would go into the market and cast the establishment news program as elitist, he would present his own news program as counter-elitist. The lack of awards is in many ways a badge of pride that reinforces the founding narrative that mainstream journalism is elitist. [...] Fox News couldn‚Äôt care less [about awards], they care about ratings, who has got the largest audience, and who is making the most money.¬†He pointed out that Murdoch‚Äôs empire was vast and multifaceted and included The Wall Street Journal newspaper, which it ‚Äúcould [always] point to [...] as its prestige award-winning news outlet.‚Äù¬†The Wall Street Journal has indeed won a number of prestigious awards, including Pulitzers and an Emmy, and as mentioned above, Gigot ‚Äî a Fox News host ‚Äî was one of its winners. A. J. Bauer, an assistant professor of journalism and creative media at the University of Alabama, echoed this argument: ""The purpose for those awards is the mutual recognition in the field of journalism. Fox [News] has always framed itself as an insurgent, as not part of the mainstream."" ""Most of these awards require you to self-nominate,"" he continued. ""I frankly don't know whether Fox News does that. They're notoriously not that open to interviews, no one has done an ethnography of that."" There are many routes to submitting for an award, but all the awards listed in the meme allow self-submissions. The Pulitzers state: ""Any person may submit material to the Pulitzer Prize competition, whether an editor of a news organization, an individual journalist or a reader."" The Emmys state that any member of a production can submit on their team's behalf. The Edward R. Murrow Awards are presented to an entire organization and not an individual, and so any eligible organization can submit to them, but independent journalists are also able to submit their work. The Peabodys also have self-submissions. We reached out to Fox News to learn more about whether it submitted its own work for consideration in the past. We will update this story if we get more information. "	true
2724	U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation that helps veterans with PTSD get service dogs.	U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation on Aug. 25, 2021, that allows veterans to train and then adopt service dogs trained to help veterans living with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The new law, Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers, or PAWS Act, was passed with bipartisan support in Congress.According to the law's text, placing a service dog with a veteran costs approximately $25,000. But research indicates these dogs can literally save lives by ameliorating the symptoms of PTSD and thus preventing veteran suicides.Under the law, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will partner with nonprofit organizations like K9s for Warriors, which provides service dogs to disabled veterans. It will give the veterans dogs to train that they will then have the opportunity to adopt.Service dogs help people with various disabilities navigate life. In the case of PTSD, the service dogs -- which can be any breed and, in the case of K9s for Warriors, are often shelter rescues -- are trained to do specific tasks that alleviate depression and anxiety. Tasks include interrupting panic attacks and provide assurance by providing physical cover to a veteran in the types of situations that trigger their PTSD.If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health, suicide or substance use crisis or emotional distress, reach out 24/7 to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) by dialing or texting 988 or using chat services at¬†suicidepreventionlifeline.org¬†to connect to a trained crisis counselor. 	true

But, you know, God came knocking on my door last summer disguised as an angry mob and it really did wake me up,‚Äù McCloskey told the talk show host.‚ÄúAnd as I campaigned for the president last fall, and as we‚Äôve continued to do rallies and events supporting our Constitutional rights, what I‚Äôve learned is the people out there in this country are just sick and tired of cancel culture and the poison of critical race theory and the big lie of systemic racism ‚Äî all backed up by the threat of mob violence.‚Äùhttps://video.foxnews.com/v/6255067975001#sp=show-clipsDuring the Carlson interview, McCloskey also stated that he was ‚Äúnever a Democrat‚Äù and said that such claims made up ‚Äúthe biggest fake news slur‚Äù that he‚Äôs ever heard; a Snopes report found that he had previously donated to both Democratic and Republican political campaigns until 2021.Court records showed that the couple had pulled a gun before in defense of their property, and the duo face felony charges for unlawful use of weapons and tampering with physical evidence. They have pleaded not guilty.	true
726	"An airplane is visible in a scene in the movie ""Gladiator,"" which was set in ancient Rome."	"On April 22, 2022, a misleading online advertisement on Twitter claimed to show a ""movie mistake"" in which an airplane can be seen flying over actor Russell Crowe and the set of the 2000 film ""Gladiator,"" which was set in ancient Rome. The moment came during one of the more famous scenes from the movie in which Crowe's character, Maximus, yells at the crowd, ""Are you not entertained?"" However, the truth is that there was no airplane in the film.In reality, the ad led to a seemingly endless slideshow article with dozens of pages. It began like this:35 Giant Movie Bloopers Even The Biggest Movies Can't HideMovies have the power to transport you into another world, but humans make movies, and that's why there can be imperfections within them. In this list, you will find out how even the most hardworking and talented directors and actors made mistakes in their movies. Grab your popcorn and read on to find out which films made BIG mistakes that no one saw - until now!Nowhere in the lengthy story did it address anything about an airplane being visible in ""Gladiator."" Also shown in the ad was a screenshot of actor Gal Gadot in the film ""Wonder Woman."" The article itself mentioned nothing about Gadot or the 2017 movie. It was all nothing more than misleading clickbait.The 1:26 mark in this YouTube video shows the same moment in the movie that was shown in the ad, confirming that there was no airplane flying across the sky in ""Gladiator"":The fake ""movie mistake"" was reported on by the WhatCulture YouTube channel in 2021, calling it a ""frequently accepted myth"" that all began with a YouTube video thumbnail. (Its true origins years ago may have been in a contest where users created fake movie mistakes with Adobe Photoshop or other similar editing software.)"	false
4142	A millionaire named Brandon Torrent allowed himself to be photographed urinating on a homeless person.	"A meme commonly circulated via social media (in various languages) purports to show a ""New Yorker millionaire"" named Brandon Torrent, who in 1979 capriciously allowed himself to be photographed urinating on a homeless person:But millionaire ""Brandon Torrent"" doesn't exist, and the photograph was staged in 1983 for use on a poster by writer and cartoonist David Gessner, who based the scene upon a satirical cartoon he had drawn in college. As Gessner explained in his blog back in 2011:My first true business venture, after college, was trying to make and market a poster in which one man urinated on another. That should be all I need to say to give you a sense of my basic business acumen. Somehow it never occurred to me that this concept -- a guy pissing on another guy -- was not going to make me rich.To be fair the story is slightly more complicated: the poster was born of a political cartoon I drew in college for the Harvard Crimson. It was a picture of the back of Ronald Reagan, recognizable mostly by his ridiculous pompadour, urinating on an African American homeless man who was sleeping, covered with newspapers, in a gutter. It was called ‚ÄúThe Trickle Down Theory.‚Äù[M]y good friend Dave and I decided to start a small business that would market satiric posters, and for our first effort we chose a real life depiction of my semi-notorious cartoon ... We decided to hire a limousine and two actors to play a chauffeur and the homeless man, while getting Dave‚Äôs grandfather to play a generic rich guy. As the director, it was part of my job to coach poor Dave‚Äôs grandpa in spraying the water from a mustard bottle onto the man playing the bum in the gutter. Dave and I filmed the thing in the backstreets of our mutual hometown, Worcester, Massachusetts.As noted in that blog entry, the original poster Gessner created simply bore the legend ""THE TRICKLE DOWN THEORY"" at its bottom. The text that now accompanies the photograph about ""New Yorker millionaire Brandon Torrent"" is a completely fabricated backstory that someone else added to the image:"	false

6070	Melania Trump plagiarized her statement on Women's History Month from Michelle Obama.	"Another day, another joke about Melania Trump plagiarizing.¬†The First Lady has been dogged by rumors about her plagiarizing various speeches ever since she delivered remarks at the 2016 Republican National Convention that bore more than a few similarities to former First Lady's Michelle Obama's remarks at the Democratic National Convention in 2008. Trump has been accused of plagiarizing Obama's MLK Day remarks (false), her United Nation's speech (false) and in March 2018 a meme falsely suggested that she also stole her comments on Women's History Month from her predecessor:Neither of these quotes can be correctly attributed to Trump or Obama, and this meme contains no actual evidence that Trump plagiarized her statement from her predecessor.¬†The top quote appears to be an altered version of the message Melania Trump posted on Twitter on 1 March 2018. That message started off the same as the above-displayed quote, (""March starts Women's History Month"") but the meme paraphrases the remainder of the tweet and excludes Trump's final sentence recognizing the humanitarian efforts of the Red Cross:¬†We found no record of Michelle Obama uttering the phrase displayed in this meme.¬†The former First Lady made two public statements on 8 March 2012 (the date specified in this meme) related to Women's History Month. She delivered a speech at the¬†the International Women of Courage Awards (the alleged quote does not appear in this speech), and she posted a message on Twitter.¬†Again, it seems that the creator of this meme reworked a genuine tweet that was sent by the former First Lady in March 2012:The statements in this meme were altered in a way to make it seem as if they were more similar than they actually were. When we compare their genuine statements delivered by Michelle Obama and Melania Trump about Women's History Month, it's clear that there's no truth to this accusations of plagiarism:MELANIA TRUMP: March starts #WomensHistoryMonth, a time to celebrate the ways American women have historically changed & continue to shape our society. As we also recognize #RedCrossMonth, we see the result of one woman‚Äôs call to action through the humanitarian relief efforts of the @Redcross"	false
1921	The Gardasil HPV vaccine has been proved to have caused the deaths of 32 women.	"Gardasil is a vaccine intended for girls and young women between the ages 9 to 26 to protect against human papillomavirus (HPV), a virus which is currently linked to an estimated 70% of known cervical cancer cases. Because Gardasil prevents only the onset of HPV infections (rather than curing those who have already been infected by HPV), health officials have advocated that girls be vaccinated for HPV prior to adolescence (or as soon as possible thereafter) in order to head off the occurrence of cervical cancer later in life.The message quoted above warns that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has already received nearly 12,000 complaints about adverse medical issues related to Gardasil vaccinations, and that 32 young women died after receiving Gardasil vaccinations. Although this information is accurate in a strictly literal sense, it is a misleading presentation of raw data that does not in itself establish a causal connection between Gardasil and the posited medical dangers.The CDC, in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), operates a program known as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The VAERS program collects and analyzes reports on adverse events following immunizations in order to help track the safety and efficacy of various vaccines. It is important to note that reports collected by VAERS are raw data; they do not in themselves establish causal connections between vaccines and adverse medical issues ‚Äî such determinations cannot be made until the reports have been investigated, evaluated, and analyzed.(To illustrate this concept, we offer the following [admittedly far-fetched] scenario: A man who received a flu vaccination and then accidentally hit his hand with a hammer a few hours later might legitimately report that soon after he received the flu vaccine, his hand began to throb painfully. Although such a report would be literally true, it would not establish any causal connection between the flu vaccine and the adverse medical symptom of a throbbing, painful hand.)As the CDC stated in its 2009 article on ""Reports of Health Concerns Following HPV Vaccination,"" before the Gardasil HPV vaccine was licensed it was studied in five clinical trials involving over 21,000 girls and women of ages 9 through 26. Since that licensing the ""CDC and FDA have been closely monitoring the safety of the HPV vaccine"" and found that:All serious reports for Gardasil have been carefully analyzed by medical experts. Experts have not found a common medical pattern to the reports of serious adverse events reported for Gardasil that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine.As of December 31, 2008, there have been 32 U.S. reports of death among females who have received the vaccine. There was no common pattern to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine.From June 2006 to March 2013, approximately 57 million doses of HPV vaccines were distributed and VAERS received approximately 22,000 adverse event reports occurring in girls and women who received them. As noted in a 2013 CDC follow-up announcement, 92% of those reports were classified as ""non-serious,"" the other 8% generally encompassed symptoms such as ""headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, syncope, and generalized weakness,"" and adverse events reported to VAERS were ""consistent with those identified during the vaccine's pre-licensure clinical trials."" The CDC also noted that:In 2011, the VSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink) studied the occurrence of specific adverse events following more than 600,000 doses of Gardasil. Adverse events in the HPV vaccinated population were compared to another appropriate population (such as adolescents vaccinated with vaccines other than HPV) and included Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), appendicitis, seizures, syncope (fainting), allergic reactions, and a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. None of these adverse events were found to be any more common after HPV vaccination than among the comparison groups.As Matthew Herper wrote for Forbes about the reported ""deaths caused by Gardasil"" phenomenon:[L]et's take a look at those 20,000 adverse events and 100 deaths and figure out what they mean. It's absolutely clear that these are for the most part not side effects from Gardasil. Nor is the vaccine, which has been given to more than 10 million people, likely responsible for those deaths.The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System was put in place in 1990 as a result of a 1986 law that requires health providers to report harm that comes to patients within a specific time period after vaccination. A great many of these reports can come from sales reps for drug manufacturers who hear about the incidents.Unfortunately, VAERS data is notoriously spotty ‚Äî better than nothing, but there's no way to insure that potential side effects are reported. When a product gets bad press, the number of reported ""adverse events"" goes up. And there is no way to tell if a particular side effect is linked to the vaccine. Some people will die after any vaccination, not because vaccines cause death but because people, even babies and adolescents, die with terrible regularity.It's true that there have been 24,000 reports of adverse events with Gardasil. There have also been 60,000 reports of death with the mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine, and 26,000 following vaccination with Pfizer's Prevnar, for pneumococcus bacteria. And yes, it's true that there have been 106 deaths reported after Gardasil vaccination. There have also been 101 deaths reported after vaccination with Prevnar 13, a new version of Prevnar introduced in 2010. It's normal for these reports to pour in for safe vaccines.You can't directly link any of those adverse events or deaths directly to the vaccines, any more than you could blame it on my morning coffee if I got hit by a truck later today. So to try to make use of this data, researchers compare the rates at which negative side effects are reported for different vaccines. The CDC and FDA did this for HPV vaccines in 2009, looking at the first 12,424 reports to VAERS and publishing the result in the Journal of the American Medical Association. They did note 2 cases of unusual neurological symptoms similar to Lou Gehrig's disease, and there was an increase in patients who had potentially dangerous blood clots, although 90% of those patients had a risk factor for those clots, such as taking birth control pills, that might explain the increase. The researchers specifically looked at Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome, a neurological disorder that had been linked to a bad batch of flu shots; there wasn't a signal that this was a problem with Gardasil. The study did result in the FDA advising doctors to watch adolescents after they get their shots, because some faint.Based on that analysis, it seems that of those dozens of deaths, only a handful could possibly be linked to Gardasil. And based on the data available, it is unlikely (though not impossible) that even those deaths were caused by the vaccine. The risks from the vaccine are very small and may be limited to headaches and fainting caused by the needle, not the vaccine itself. Gardasil has been studied in clinical trials of more than 30,000 people; Cervarix, the competitor vaccine, has run a similar gantlet.A couple of other pieces of anti-Gardasil misinformation have been widely circulated, such as the video featuring Jenny Thompson of Health Sciences Institute which is linked at the end of the warning reproduced at the head of this page:Note that this video deals primarily with subjects such as the political and moral issues involved with requiring HPV vaccinations for young girls, the notion that vaccinated girls might mistakenly believe they had been immunized against contracting sexually transmitted diseases (other than HPV), and the claim that cervical cancer deaths can be effectively eliminated through means other than HPV vaccinations. It offers no real evidence that Gardasil vaccinations are dangerous other than to cite the raw VAERS data referenced above (without noting that analysis of those reports failed to establish a causal link between HPV vaccinations and the reported serious adverse events).Likewise, another much-reproduced article claims that in 2009, Dr. Diane Harper (who is consistently misidentified as ""the lead researcher in the development of Gardasil and Cervarix"") gave a talk at which she ""came clean"" and admitted that ""Gardasil and Cervarix don't work, are dangerous, and weren't tested."" That article grossly misrepresents what Dr. Harper actually said. Dr. Harper has expressed concerns such as how long protection from vaccines such as Gardasil will last (which is not a safety issue, but rather an issue of whether the expected results of an HPV immunization program will justify the financial costs), and whether the marketing of Gardasil might lead some women to avoid taking other STD-preventing precautions, but she has never said that Gardasil ""doesn't work,"" ""wasn't tested,"" or was ""dangerous,"" as explained in great detail at the Skeptical Raptor blog:In a 2012 peer-reviewed article about Cervarix, Dr. Harper states that ""Cervarix is an excellent choice for both screened and unscreened populations due to its long-lasting protection, its broad protection for at least five oncogenic HPV types, the potential to use only one-dose for the same level of protection, and its safety."" Again, she speculates that cervical cancer screening may be just as useful, but nowhere does she recommend that the vaccine not be used, that it's safety profile is unacceptable, or that the vaccine cannot prevent cancer. In fact, she recommends expanding the guidelines for HPV vaccines for older women because as they age, they are more susceptible to other serotypes of HPV, against which Cervarix confers protection. She also states that Cervarix may also have a protective effect against some autoimmune disorders. This does not sound like a researcher who is losing sleep about the HPV vaccine, but who fully supports its use, with some exceptions.Dr. Diane Harper is one of the leading researchers in biomedical science, an individual who has spent her life studying vaccines. She has the academic training and research credibility at a level that if she said ""Gardasil is dangerous,"" many of us would stand up and begin to wonder. But the facts are she has not said anything of the sort about Gardasil and Cervarix. In peer-reviewed articles published in important, high impact journals, she has given strong, but scientifically qualified, endorsements to HPV vaccines. These are the facts. Any other allegations about her lack of support for vaccinations is based on misinformation, disinformation and lies.A 2009 CBS News interview with Dr. Harper is often cited as contradicting this assessment, but it does not: Dr. Harper did not state during that interview that Gardasil doesn't work, is dangerous, or wasn't tested. Given questions about how long the vaccine is effective for, she questioned the efficacy of giving shots to girls as young as 11 years old in parts of the world (such as the U.S.) where women regularly undergo safety Pap screening repeatedly over their lifetimes, saying that the chances of their contracting cervical cancer may be less than the ""small"" risks associated with the vaccine. But Dr. Harper also noted that the risks of death surrounding the administration of Gardasil were ""very rare,"" and that she ""agrees with Merck and the CDC that Gardasil is safe for most girls and women."""	false
2847	Security camera footage from a Wingate Hotel in Illinois captured a screaming ghost leaving room 209.	"In 2012, a video appeared on YouTube that purportedly showed a ""screaming ghost"" leaving room 209 at a Wingate Hotel in Illinois.On May 19, 2021, the video was reposted by popular TikTok user @sloowmoee, where it was played more than 2 million times in 24 hours.According to the YouTube video's description, the ghost clip was given to YouTube user Jimmynut22 by hotel security.""This video was submitted to us by the hotel security manager who was standing watch on September 14, 2003, at a WINGATE HOTEL in Illinois. His voice can be heard in the background of the recording.""In the video, John, a purported employee of an Illinois Wingate Hotel, leaves an elevator on the second floor. He walks to room 209, where he hears screaming coming from inside. A ""hotel security manager"" communicates over a walkie-talkie. After John opens the door, a figure appears to leave the room.Various security camera angles are shown. Elevators, stairwells, a large indoor swimming pool, a hotel entrance, and hallways all appear in the clip.Several moments in the video indicated that it was fake. However, one final clue confirmed it. It appeared to simply be an entertaining and promotional film that was created all in good fun.We will first study some of the minor clues, some of which might have been intentionally left behind by the creator.First, if this footage was really shot at a Wingate Hotel in Illinois in 2003, it certainly had a large number of expensive high definition cameras for the time period. Widescreen, high definition video was far from the norm at the time. For example, five years later in 2008, ""only 23 percent of U.S. households owned at least one HDTV.""Further, in 2021, the average night's stay for a Wingate Hotel in Illinois is just over $100. It would be highly unlikely that such an inexpensive hotel would invest in such pricey, state-of-the-art technology.It appears that color and grain effects may have been added to all of the supposed security footage for added drama.Also, at the 0:13 mark in the video, a camera inside the elevator shakes more than expected for a mounted security camera. This indicated that it was likely positioned on a tall tripod.The video appears to indicate that John, the man who inspects room 209 in the video, was part of the hotel's security staff.The description of the video also said that a ""hotel security manager"" was speaking with him over a walkie-talkie.As noted before, the average price of a Wingate Hotel stay in the state of Illinois averages just above $100. It would be highly unlikely that a hotel at this price would have two security employees on the clock at the same time.A large indoor swimming pool is visible in the video at the 0:12 mark. Its ceiling appears to be around two floors in height, with windows to the second floor visible on the wall. It's perhaps likely that a camera on a tripod was pointed out of one of these windows to give the effect of a birds-eye security camera look. The indoor swimming pool as seen in the YouTube video. (Courtesy: Jimmynut22/YouTube)We researched Wingate Hotels in Illinois and found that this kind of large indoor pool is not consistent with any current properties.For example, a search for the company's hotels in the state only showed much smaller swimming pools without a tall ceiling: An indoor swimming pool at a Wingate Hotel in Illinois.The Anomalies Research Society blog appeared to have identified the YouTube user who posted the video. According to the website, Jimmynut22 is a filmmaker named Turner Clay. According to IMDb, Clay has experience in a number of filmmaking roles, including visual effects.A screenshot posted by the blog showed Jimmynut22 saying ""my name is Turner Clay."" However, that comment has disappeared.On the same YouTube channel, Jimmynut22, or Turner Clay, also promoted a series of films called ""The Blackwell Ghost.""""The Blackwell Ghost"" film series from Clay is available on Amazon Prime Video.At the end of the film, the credits show a special thanks to ""John & Jimmynut22 (Ghost Screaming In Haunted Hotel)."" This indicated that Turner Clay provided the acting and voice work for the Wingate Hotel video.One bit of trivia added to the film on Prime Video said: ""The hat Clay wears in his plan has appeared in another one of his 'found' footage films."" This appeared to reference the hat worn by John in the hotel video.Another trivia line read: ""Turner Clay also played John, the security guard from the popular Screaming [Wingate] Hotel guest in 209 hoax paranormal video on YouTube. He references at the beginning. (not sure how he talks to himself ;) ).""At the 4:19 mark in ""The Blackwell Ghost,"" Clay purportedly talks on the phone with John. Clay says: ""I actually saw the video organically."" This, of course, is inconsistent with the fact that Jimmynut22 is Turner Clay and was the original poster of the video purportedly shot at a Wingate Hotel in Illinois."	false
1965	A deadly shooting in St. Louis on Oct. 24, 2022, took place at a high school that had metal detectors, locked doors, and seven security officers working in the building.	"On Oct. 24, 2022, Twitter user @emzorbit tweeted, ""The St. Louis school that was the site of an active shooter today had metal detectors, all doors were locked,"" and said that ""seven security officers in the school,"" yet ""still, the shooter gained entry and people died."" All of this was true in the case of the deadly shooting that took place on the same day at Central Visual and Performing Arts (CVPA) High School.In addition to receiving tens of thousands of retweets and likes, it was also widely shared as a screenshot on Instagram, Reddit, and elsewhere.The shooting resulted in the deaths of a teacher and student, The Associated Press reported. Seven other students were also wounded before the shooter was gunned down by police officers who had arrived on the scene:A 19-year-old who killed a teacher and a 15-year-old girl at a St. Louis high school was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and what appeared to be more than 600 rounds of ammunition, a police official said Tuesday.Orlando Harris also left behind a handwritten note offering his explanation for¬†the shooting Monday at Central Visual and Performing Arts High School,¬†St. Louis Police Commissioner Michael Sack told reporters. Tenth-grader Alexzandria Bell and 61-year-old physical education teacher Jean Kuczka died and seven students were wounded before police killed Harris in an exchange of gunfire.During a news conference on the day of the shooting, George Sells, the director of communications and marketing for Saint Louis Public Schools, spoke about seven security personnel who were working in the building at the time the shooting began. This information confirmed part of the viral tweet.Michael Sack, the interim commissioner for the St. Louis Police Department, also said at the same news conference that, ""Not all of the public safety school security officers are armed."" In the same answer, he confirmed that the doors were locked and that the school was equipped with metal detectors:They've got the doors locked. They've got the metal detectors. They're taking all the reasonable precautions. We'll be meeting with them after we have some time to talk about opportunities to make their facilities harder to get into. But if there's somebody who has a will, they're going to figure it out. We don't want to make it easy for them, but we've just got to do the best we can to extend that time it takes them to get into the building to buy us time to respond and get there.Sack's comments begin at the 8:58 mark in the following video. The remarks from Sells start at the 16:29 mark.Reuters reported the same information from the news conference, publishing that ""the high school had seven security officers on site and metal detectors,"" and that ""the security officers were not armed."" The story also mentioned that the doors to the St. Louis school were locked, just as Sack said."	true
5965	"The permit for the ""March for Our Lives"" rally was submitted several months before the Valentine's Day school shooting."	"On 30 March 2018, the hoax-spreading, self-described conservative blog FellowshipoftheMinds.com posted a story reporting that organizers of the ""March for Our Lives"" rally in Washington, D.C., had applied for march permits months before the 14 February 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida.The story was based on an e-mail exchange between James Fetzer, a retired philosopher-turned-conspiracy theorist, and Scott Earhardt, an officer with the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). In the message, Earhardt appeared to suggest the permit for the 24 March 2018 rally had been submitted well before the 14 February 2018 school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in which seventeen people were murdered, saying that ""In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018. MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event.""FellowShipoftheMinds and other disreputable web sites predictably took this statement at face value and ran with it without verifying whether it was true¬†‚Äî and it's not.We called Earhardt, but he declined to comment because he was not authorized to do so and instead referred us to MPD's public affairs department. However, Earhardt told non-partisan fact checker PolitiFact that he had confused the ""March for Our Lives"" rally with an annual event in January bearing a similar name: March for Life.MPD spokeswoman Karimah Bilal told us that the permit application for the March for Our Lives rally was received on 21 February 2018, one week after the massacre. We obtained a copy of the march permit application via a Freedom of Information Act request and confirmed that it was submitted on 21 February 2018, one week after the massacre. The document can be viewed below.A pervasive, but consistently unfounded trope among conspiracy theorists and ""hoaxers"" is that any mass casualty incident, particularly mass shootings, are ""false flags,"" or events engineered by the government in a widespread plot to install an authoritarian global government (often referred to as the ""New World Order""). Hoaxers generally appear to believe that such tragedies are precursors to a nationwide gun grab, and they have regularly targeted survivors and family members of mass shooting victims from incidents like the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the 2017 church massacre in Sutherland Springs, Texas and most recently the Parkland shooting as a result."	false
3514	Then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore certified the election victory of his political opponent, George W. Bush.	"On Jan. 5, 2020, the day before Congress would meet to count and certify U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's presidential victory, President Trump posted a message on Twitter falsely claiming that Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the election results by rejecting ""fraudulently chosen"" electors:The vice president does not have the authority to reject a state's chosen electors.As we explored in a previous article, Pence's role is to oversee the counting of votes (which have already been certified in all 50 states), not to determine their validity.¬†On social media, people pointed to a historical example of a vice president overseeing a controversial election to emphasize this point. The 2000 presidential contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush, for instance, was decided by just five electoral college votes after a hotly contested recount in Florida. Gore, who was serving as vice president at the time, also won the popular vote. If a vice president had the power to reject a state's electors, the internet argued, wouldn't Gore have overturned Florida's electoral college votes and claimed victory for himself?Gore, like Pence, did not have the authority to do so. As vice president, Gore's role was merely to oversee the count and announce the winner, which he did on Jan. 5, 2001:https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4933328/user-clip-gore-certifies-bush-victoryIt should also be noted that several Democrats attempted to object to Florida's electoral college votes. As these objections were not accompanied by a signature from members of both the House and the Senate, as required by law, Gore dismissed these complaints.The New York Times wrote at the time:The rancor lingering from the bitterly contested presidential election spilled over during a joint session of Congress today, forcing Vice President Al Gore to gavel down black House members time and again in order to make official the election of his opponent, George W. Bush.Congressional certification of the Electoral College vote is usually quick and routine. But nothing has been ordinary about the November election that will result in Mr. Bush being sworn in this month as the first president since Benjamin Harrison in 1888 to win the Electoral College but lose the popular vote.Today, for nearly 20 minutes in the cavernous House chamber, a dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus, joined by a few sympathizers, tried in vain to block the counting of Florida's 25 electoral votes, protesting that black voters had been disenfranchised. Florida's highly contested electoral votes were crucial in Mr. Bush's victory after a prolonged legal and political battle following an inconclusive election.Federal law requires a member of both the House and the Senate to question a state's electoral votes in writing for a formal objection to be considered. But the House members had no Senate support. So Mr. Gore, who was presiding in his role as Senate president, slammed down the gavel to silence them and rule their objections and parliamentary maneuvers out of order.The full video of Gore presiding over the certification of the presidential election he lost can be seen on C-SPAN. Below is a 20-minute clip of Gore hearing and dismissing objections to his election loss:https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4933341/user-clip-gore-rejects-vote-objections"	true
575	Some Parmesan cheeses are made using the stomach linings of baby cows.	"Around early January 2023, a number of social media users expressed shock when they found that some brands of Parmesan cheese, the specialty from Italy, contain rennet, an enzyme that is traditionally taken from the stomach lining of calves. News¬†articles confirmed the finding, with¬†some¬†citing the¬†animal welfare organization, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).¬†This revelation was not new, though.¬†The information has long been available; see this article from The Guardian, and¬†this 2013 post by the¬†NZ Vegetarian Society on Facebook, ""...Parmesan cheese is an EU 'protected designation of origin' product and has to be made using calf rennet, so it's definitely not suitable for vegetarians.""The enzyme is used for curdling milk in the cheese-making process.¬†¬†""Today years old when I found out Parmesan cheese is made from baby cow's stomach & I could go cry, tweeted @dtheebae on Jan. 9, 2023. ""I'm just gonna have to go full vegan at this point.""On Facebook too, some users were surprised. ""It's made from what?!,"" asked UNILAD on Jan. 12, 2023. However, shocked reactions were neither new nor recent. ""I just found out Parmesan cheese isn't vegetarian and basically my whole life is a lie,"" wrote BuzzFeed's Delaney Strunk in 2019.The BuzzFeed reporter found that ""apparently to earn the authentic legal title of Parmigiano-Reggiano, the cheese must be created using calf rennet.""¬†Parmigiano-Reggiano (or Parmesan, as it is popularly known) ""is a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO mark) marked product."" Parmesan got that POD status in 1996.Besides Parmesan, there are other cheeses made using rennet. According to Vegetarian Society, Gorgonzola and Grana Padano use animal rennet. Insider lists more varieties in addition to those two, including Pecorino Romano, Camembert, Vacherin, Emmenthaler, Gruy√®re, and Manchego.But hold on. It's not all gloom and doom for Parmesan lovers. There are vegan alternatives available that do not use any dairy products. PETA has published a list of vegan cheese available in the market."	true
1082	After he became vice president in 2008, current U.S. President Joe Biden gave his uncle, Frank H. Biden, a Purple Heart for his military service in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II.	"Though Biden's uncle did serve in the military during World War II, he died in 1999, according to available records, so Biden would not have been able to give him a Purple Heart medal in the time period he claimed he did. We reached out to the White House for comment, but a spokesperson did not respond to our specific questions. U.S. President Joe Biden is an inveterate storyteller, but more than once has misstated the facts¬†during the course of his stories and speeches, a pattern for which he has been criticized. A particular claim that he made in December 2022 pertaining to his own family appears to follow that pattern. On Dec. 16, during remarks he made at the Delaware Veterans Summit and PACT Act Town Hall, he said he gave his uncle Frank Biden a Purple Heart medal after becoming vice president in 2008. ¬†The Purple Heart is a medal¬†awarded to serving members of the armed forces who were wounded or killed (it is given posthumously as well) in action. It is the highest award given automatically to anyone who meets the criteria and can be given multiple times if the person is wounded on separate occasions.¬†According to Biden, his father asked him to help rectify the fact that the veteran uncle earned but never received a Purple Heart medal for his military service:You know, I ‚Äî my dad, when I got elected Vice President, he said, ""Joey, Uncle Frank fought in the Battle of the Bulge.""¬† He was not feeling very well now ‚Äî not because of the Battle of the Bulge. ¬†But he said, ""And he won the Purple Heart. And he never received it. He never‚Äîhe never got it. ¬†Do you think you could help him get it? We'll surprise him.""So we got him the Purple Heart. He had won it in the Battle of the Bulge. And I remember he came over to the house, and I came out, and he said, ""Present it to him, okay?"" We had the family there.I said, ""Uncle Frank, you won this. ¬†And I want to‚Ä¶"" He said, ""I don't want the damn thing."" (Laughter.) No, I'm serious. ¬†He said, ""I don't want it."" ¬†I said, ""What's the matter, Uncle Frank? You earned it."" He said, ""Yeah, but the others died. The others died. I lived. I don't want it.""¬†There are a number of inaccuracies in this story. It would have been impossible for Biden to have had this conversation with his father when he said he did, because his father died in 2002, several years before Biden assumed the vice presidency.¬†Assuming Biden might have been referring to an earlier conversation with his father, he still could not have given his uncle a medal after 2008. Frank H. Biden, according to a number of obituaries, died at the age of 81 in 1999. The Tribune in Scranton, Pennsylvania, confirmed that he was indeed the uncle of then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden.¬†
(The News Journal (1999))
(The Tribune (1999))On Jan. 20, 2021, at the time of Biden's inauguration, the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs posted a photograph of Frank Biden's gravestone, as well as his obituary. The NCA wrote, ""He entered service July 17, 1941 at Camp Lee, Virginia and was discharged July 24, 1945 at McGuire General Hospital in Richmond. After the war he became a salesman at Sterling Auto Sales in Wilmington, Delaware."" ¬†They added that ""While he isn't interred in a national cemetery, like all eligible Veterans he received a free grave marker from the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs."" Neither the NCA, nor the grave marker, indicate that Frank Biden received a Purple Heart. There are a number of incomplete lists of Purple Heart recipients online in which we could not find evidence of Frank Biden winning one, though that does not mean he never did. No consistent record of Purple Heart recipients exists.¬†Regardless, Biden's specific claim about giving his uncle a Purple Heart during his vice presidency is incorrect. We reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive responses to our specific questions, including whether his uncle was ever awarded a Purple Heart.¬†"	false
5292	"President Trump banned the song ""Feliz Navidad"" from the White House."	"President Donald Trump has made a number of disparaging comments about Mexicans and immigrants since stepping into the political spotlight. He has also repeatedly bragged about bringing the phrase ""Merry Christmas"" back to the White House (despite the fact that it never left). So when the satirical blog ""Laughing in Disbelief"" published an article in December 2018 reporting that President Trump had banned the song ""Feliz Navidad"" from the White House, many readers found the claim to be plausible:President Donald Trump is banning the classic Christmas song Feliz Navidad from all White House functions.

6084	A worker at a British dairy that produces Anchor Butter contaminated the company's products with HIV-infected blood.	"Mere days after an identical rumor¬†targeted the U.K.-based confectionery company Cadbury in February 2018, a flurry of social media posts spread the claim that a worker at a U.K. dairy ""added HIV infected blood in the Anchor Butter production"":The name of the dairy where Anchor Butter is produced in England is actually Westbury Dairies, located in Wiltshire. A representative of Westbury's parent company, Arla Foods UK, confirmed to us by email that the rumor is false.""Please be assured this is a hoax in very poor taste,"" the company's consumer relations department said.Unsurprisingly, a search of the BBC News web site turned up no articles or videos reporting that butter or any other dairy product in the U.K. was contaminated with HIV-infected blood, or that anyone was arrested by police for doing such a thing. Using a reverse-image search, we determined that the image used in the Anchor Butter meme was¬†lifted¬†either from a 2015 article about crime in London or an earlier (2014) article in the Evening Standard¬†about Scotland Yard conducting police raids across London.Both the Anchor Butter and Cadbury memes were unoriginal updates of an internet hoax dating back several years. Among the other food and beverage items falsely alleged to have been contaminated with the virus that causes AIDS are pineapples, oranges, bananas, canned goods, and soft drinks, including Pepsi-ColaThis is the guys who added his infected blood to Pepsi :)#Copied pic.twitter.com/4rf5m2a5XR‚Äî RKJockies (@rkjhaw) December 18, 2017
Because the specter of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), scares people, the rumor continues to mutate and thrive despite the extreme unlikelihood of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) being transmitted in such a manner. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the virus cannot survive long outside a human host and only under the rarest circumstances has been passed from person to person via food:You can‚Äôt get HIV from consuming food handled by an HIV-infected person. Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus."	false
6264	"Nancy Pelosi said that building a wall will violate the rights of ""millions of 'illegals.'"""	"In January 2018, amid a brief government shutdown and a furor over the potential deportation of recipients of the Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals act, or DACA, a months-old meme reappeared featuring a photograph of¬†House¬†Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and a quote about how building a wall on the southern United States border ""will violate the right of millions of illegals"":The graphic proved popular in some conservative circles, where it was¬†shared along with messages that insult Pelosi as dumb,¬†clueless, or out of touch. It was also frequently attached to comments asserting (inaccurately) that the rights of ""illegals"" couldn't be violated since illegal immigrants don't have any rights to violate:This fake quote originally appeared in August 2017, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened a government shutdown in order to secure funding for a border wall. Nancy Pelosi released a statement in response which labeled the wall ""immoral"" (emphasis ours):""Last night, President Trump yet again threatened to cause chaos in the lives of millions of Americans if he doesn‚Äôt get his way. ¬†Make no mistake: the President said he will purposefully hurt American communities to force American taxpayers to fund an immoral, ineffective and expensive border wall.‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs multi-billion dollar border wall boondoggle is strongly opposed by Democrats and many Republicans. Democrats will stand fast against the immoral, ineffective border wall and the rest of Republicans‚Äô unacceptable poison pill riders.""This fake quote began to¬†circulate¬†shortly after Pelosi released that statement:The argument might be made that this particular meme paraphrases Pelosi's attitude toward the wall. However, it naturally became¬†incorrectly presented¬†as though it was a direct quote from House Minority Leader:The idea that undocumented people can't have their rights violated because they have no rights to begin with is false. Undocumented people may not enjoy all of the Constitutional rights given to American citizens, but they do have some protections under the law. Furthermore, referring to undocumented people as ""illegal"" is not accurate, as the violation in and of itself is¬†civil, not¬†criminal:In fact, a 2006 study showed that roughly 45% of undocumented immigrants originally entered the US legally, but then remained in the country without authorization after their visas had expired.The penalty for this type of violation of immigration law is deportation, and according to the ACLU, ""civil removal proceedings far outnumber criminal prosecutions and remain the primary manner in which the federal authorities enforce the immigration laws.""If, however, an undocumented immigrant is deported and then returns to the US without permission, then that ""illegal re-entry"" constitutes¬†a federal offense¬†with different tiers of accompanying prison time."	false
798	U.S. President Joe Biden tripped and fell while climbing up stairs to Air Force One as he left Poland on Feb. 22, 2023.	"As U.S. President Joe Biden left Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 22, 2023, after a surprise visit to Ukraine, videos of him stumbling while climbing stairs to Air Force One went viral. The footage appeared to show him walking up the stairs, and, near the top, stumbling slightly and falling forward. He caught himself, stood up and continued to climb.Sharing the clip, Liz Wheeler, the host of a conservative political commentary podcast, wrote on Twitter, ""Joe Biden trips and falls up the stairs on Air Force One.""To determine whether the clip was real or miscaptioned, we looked for longer videos of Biden's walk up the stairs from reputable news sources. By examining footage from Sky News, for instance, at the 18-minute mark, we saw Biden did indeed stumble:We reached out to the White House for confirmation and received its pool report for the day. That document read: ""The president boarded at 5:34. About half way up the main stairs he stumbled and fell forward. He quickly recovered, stood and continued to the door, giving a quick wave before going in.""Given that acknowledgment from the White House, as well as the clear, undoctored video evidence that shows Biden stumbling, we rate this claim as ""True.""The videos of the fall are not to be confused with miscaptioned footage from earlier in the trip ‚Äî a clip that supposedly showed Biden falling down the stairs when disembarking from Air Force One.¬†In that video, the individual who fell was not actually the president.¬†Critics of Biden used the Feb. 22 slip to comment on Biden's health, question his fitness for office, and recall his past stumbles. (We have covered Biden's falls before, including a time he fell off a bicycle in 2022. Also, the February 2023 incident was not the first time cameras caught Biden tripping while boarding Air Force One.)"	true
3015	The 2020 Census count will result in shifts that include some states gaining U.S. House of Representative seats and Electoral College votes, others losing.	"On April 26, 2021, the U.S. Census Bureau released the first results of its 2020 Census count ‚Äî a count that shifted representation in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Electoral College.As explained on Census.gov, ""The data collected by the census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives (a process called apportionment) and is also used to distribute billions in federal funds to local communities."" Due to population shifts, some states gained seats while others lost. Texas gained the most, adding two congressional seats:¬†As of April 1, 2020, the U.S. resident population had grown by nearly 23 million since 2010, according to the Census Bureau. States with large urban centers like California, Illinois, and New York lost residents and thus lost population-based representation, while others gained:Texas will gain two seats in the House of Representatives, five states will gain one seat each (Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina, and Oregon), seven states will lose one seat each (California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia), and the remaining states‚Äô number of seats will not change based on the 2020 Census.These states will also gain and lose the same number of electoral votes. Demonstrating how pivotal the data is to representation at the federal level, New York lost a seat in Congress by coming up short by 89 people.The release of initial findings from the 2020 Census are reflective of a turbulent year, beset not just by the COVID-19 pandemic but also natural disasters and interference by the Trump administration, as NPR reported:COVID-19 forced the agency to postpone in-person counting for months, and the bureau's door knockers also had to contend with hurricanes and wildfires in some parts of the country. As NPR first reported, the census was further disrupted last July when the Trump administration decided to cut short the schedule for gathering census responses and running quality checks on the collected data. Extra time was needed, the bureau said, to sort through a high volume of duplicate and incomplete responses.NPR also reported that ""The Trump administration's failed push for a citizenship question may also have further discouraged households with immigrants and people of color from getting counted."""	true
5951	A 19-year-old college student in Kenya purposefully infected 324 men with human immunodeficiency virus in an act of revenge.	"During the 1980s and 1990s, at the height of the HIV and AIDS crises, rumors ran wild about people deliberately spreading the virus to their clueless sexual partners. Although the stigma over HIV has somewhat subsided over the ensuing decades, the rumors about ""AIDS Mary"" are still alive and well.¬†A modern version of this urban legend first appeared online in 2014, after the Kenya Daily Post published an article appearing to report that a 19-year-old college student in Kenya had¬†purposefully infected 324 men with human immunodeficiency virus, and that she planned on infecting thousands by the end of the year:SHOCKER!!!! A University female student confesses to have infected more than 324 men in Nakuru with HIV.... She targets 2000 before the year ends!!!!!!!Problems in the Original StoryThe article was entirely based on a Facebook post that was allegedly posted to a page called ""Kenya Scandals, Hidden Controversial Files Exposed."" This Facebook page no longer exists, and we were unable to find this post anywhere in any Internet archives. However, the anonymous message driving this story has been preserved by a number of questionable web sites:I'm 19 and a 2nd year student here at Kabarak University. I joined this college a virgin though I have had boyfriends before,my parents are strict so having sex was never on my mind.Septmber 22nd, 2013, is a day I will never forget,we went clubbing in town and got drunk with some senior students then went back hostels for party around 2amI remember waking up naked to a guy called Javan with my private part painful and I realised he had sex with me when I was drunk. I only asked if he used a condom and he said yes.However, when taking bathIi noticed sperms down there,i wanted to commit suicide,i feared getting pregnant and HIV, I took drug and hoped i was HIV free.In November, I tested HIV positive,I felt like cutting off my neck. I confronted theguy and he insisted he was clean that I got it from somewhere.I was so depressed and took alcohol to die. I even bought poison,the pain was just unbearable. How was I gonna face the world? I let my parents down. I gave up on the world and just wanted to end my life.Something came up in my mind that I should revenge. I hated men and I didn‚Äôt want to be near anymore. My future had been ruined, somehow someone had to pay.After a private therapy sessions, I gained strength not even my parents,friends knew of my conditions even up to now.I accepted my fate and promised to make all men I come across suffer. i know I am attractive and both married and unmarried men chase me left, right and center, luckily, my body has remained good and if anything my curves got better something you men like.I buried the good girl in me and became the bad girl. My goal was to infect as many as possible. So far, since December up to now, I have infected 324 men and I make sure to note down there list which I secretly keep. I plan to release it when I wiil be on my death bed.I know I have nothing left to do on earth but to wait for my death but before i do, men will get it.My target is over 2000 by the end of the year, pregnancy is out of question because I am on contraceptives. So I just do raw which most men here love. They don't even question becauase my looks and body work greatly for me.Out of the 324 I have infected so far, about 156 are students here at the college, the remaining are married men outside, lecturers,lawyers,some celebs and 3 politicians. Not a day passes without me having sex, mostly four people per day.This is an unverified story from an anonymous author that was posted to a Facebook page seemingly dedicated to scandals and rumors. The story itself is also rather preposterous. For one, how does this woman know how many people she infected? After all, having unprotected sex with someone who is HIV-positive does not automatically mean that the disease will spread:A heterosexual person infected with HIV will transmit the virus to their partner once in every 900 times the couple has unprotected sex, according to a new study conducted in Africa.However, the exact number of sexual acts that are needed to transmit the virus can vary tremendously depending on the amount of the virus in the infected person's blood, said study researcher James Hughes, of the University of Washington in Seattle.Unless this anonymous woman accompanied her victims to the hospital after every sexual encounter for testing after a set period of time, there's no way she would know how many people she had given HIV.¬†The web site ""Make Kenya Better"" took a closer look at some of the more specific claims in the story. Daniel Kibet, who was reportedly in his final year at¬†Kabarak University when this rumor started to circulate, said that the school's strict rules on gender segregation, the relatively small student population, and the fact that this woman was claiming she had more than three sexual partners per day for three months made this story completely implausible:In her story there are some gaps and misinformation that gave us an impression she was lying about everything.[...]In Kabarak main campus, men are banned from ladies hostels and if any man is found loitering around the ladies hostels then he or she would be suspended from school.So the part where she said that they went back to the hostels and had an after party after partying in Nakuru town is All FALSE.[...]December has 31 days, January has 31 days and February has 28 days. If you add up the days you will end up with 90 days exactly. And the lady said she has infected 324 men from December. Let‚Äôs do the math.If you divide you will get 3.6 that is 3 different dudes per day.You will ask yourself is she a prostitute or what? How can a university student who has classes and assignments have time to f**k 3 dudes in one day.Problems With Subsequent PostingsThere are several other factors that point to this being a fearmongering rumor, as opposed to a genuine story about sexual revenge. For one thing, as this rumor was passed from disreputable web site to spurious blog, the accompanying photograph seemed to change. Many of these outlets claimed that images were culled from this woman's Facebook profile. This is suspicious, however, as the woman's identity was supposedly never revealed. Furthermore, we've seen photographs of least five different women used to spread the hoax:Theses images were taken from dating profiles, porn web sites, and¬†social media posts (such as this one, which is decidedly not safe for work). However, we couldn't connect any of these images to a¬†19-year-old student in Kenya.¬†Another clue that this rumor is based more on fear than facts is that it receives minor updates with each passing year. In addition to changing the photograph, these sites have also altered the number of men reportedly infected with HIV by this woman, as well as her goal date for completing her revenge.For example, the disreputable blog¬†Now8News¬†rehashed this story, but claimed in their title that the woman had now infected 586 men (not 324) and that she planned on infecting more than 2000 by the end of 2018, not 2014. Interestingly, the body of that article still said that this took place in 2017, which must have been a holdover from the previous year's piece:¬†Social networks have been buzzing over the past couple of days with the story of a female university student who, over a period of five months, infected 586 men with HIV in ‚Äúrevenge.‚Äù The student, whose name has been withheld, claims to have infected married men, lecturers, fellow students and celebrities. According to the report, her aim was to infect 2,000 men with the virus. Her vengeance was met with horror and much criticism over social media.Her new goal is to infect at least 2,000 men stating, ‚ÄúI know I have nothing left to do on earth but wait for my death.‚Äù Surprisingly, she keeps a list of how many men she has slept with so far, and rewarded with HIV. According to her, she already infected 586 men and wanted to finish 2017 with the 2,000 mark.To Sum Up"	false
5585	"Taylor Swift was photographed in the company of former NFL quarterback and ""take a knee"" protester Colin Kaepernick at a San Francisco nightclub."	"Pop songstress Taylor Swift made waves in early October 2018 by announcing she would vote for a Democratic senatorial candidate in Tennessee's upcoming midterm election, breaking her longstanding silence on political issues, according to multiple press reports.The move earned Swift both kudos and jeers from the public. Predictably, it also inspired junk news purveyors to fabricate stories related to her foray into politics.A report that appeared on America's Last Line of Defense (LLOD) (and was reposted on at least two other websites) proclaimed that Swift was ""busted"" on a date with former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who is best known for protesting racial injustice by kneeling during renditions of the national anthem:
Taylor Swift destroyed her career yesterday by coming out to back the Democrat party of losers. Nobody could understand why. Her post on Instagram looked like a leftist cult member wrote it. Freedom of choice and the gays are all well and good, but they don‚Äôt belong in your job.Today, the truth has come out. A photographer snapped 14 pictures of Taylor Swift and Colin Kaepernick last night at Klub Karl in downtown San Fransisco [sic]. The club is a known socialist hangout. The photographer was spotted and searched and his camera was destroyed but he was able to get a headshot of Swift with his phone, proving she was at the infamous club. The wall behind her is unmistakable.Swift and Kaepernick arrived and left at different times, but people inside the club have confirmed that they acted like a couple. Security officers at the building across from Swift‚Äôs hotel said that Swift and Colin Kaepernick arrived together and he never left.Despite the claim that a photographer documented Swift's presence outside an ""infamous club"" and ""known socialist hangout"" called ""Klub Karl"" in San Francisco, the only image accompanying the article appeared to show her instead standing outside Alice Tully Hall in New York's Lincoln Center.There is, in fact, no ""Klub Karl"" in San Francisco.America's Last Line of Defense is part of a network of websites and social media accounts notorious for publishing so-called ""satirical"" content with clickbait headlines aimed at ridiculing conservative viewpoints.

4719	NASA issued a warning that Earth could be hit by an asteroid around Christmas 2019.	"On Oct. 23, 2019, the U.K. tabloid Express published an article that left some readers believing they need not make Christmas plans this year because Earth was in danger of being hit by a large asteroid:The article was entitled ""Asteroid terror: NASA spot mammoth space rock to hit Earth's orbit five days before X-mas."" The subheading gave earthlings an even smaller chance of survival: ""AN ASTEROID the size of the World Trade Centre is on a dangerous Earth-bound orbit that could see the rock smash the planet during Christmas festivities.""When the article was regurgitated by even less-reputable websites, the fear-mongering title morphed into a factually inaccurate claim. For instance, the website Digital Wise rehashed this article under the title ""NASA Issues Warning Over Asteroid Predicted To Hit Earth Five Days Before Christmas!""NASA has made no such announcement, and Earth is not in danger of being hit by an asteroid around Christmas.¬†These articles are all based on a real asteroid (known as 216258 2006 WH1) and its holiday approach toward Earth. However, these articles present the information as if this asteroid is particularly dangerous. But there's nothing unusually threatening about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1.NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) currently lists 26 near-Earth objects that are scheduled to pass by our planet within the next 60 days. While asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 (which was discovered in 2006) will truly be passing by earth around Christmas, CNEOS reports that the asteroid is expected to safely pass by earth at a distance of about 15.19 LD (lunar distance), approximately 3.6 million miles.Dr. Paul W. Chodas, the Director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, told us in an email that there is ""nothing unusual or dangerous"" about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1:No, there is nothing unusual or dangerous about this asteroid. It is simply making a close approach to the Earth. Astronomers have been observing this asteroid‚Äôs position for 13 years, we know its orbit very accurately, we can predict its close approaches accurately for the next 200 years, and we know with certainty that it cannot hit our planet.Lindley Johnson, NASA‚Äôs Planetary Defense Officer and Program Executive of the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), also told us that this asteroid ""poses no hazard to impacting earth"":¬†NASA and other US agencies are lead players in the international effort to develop plans to respond to a possible Near-Earth Object (NEO) impact. In 2018, the White House released the National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan, which identifies key steps that US agencies need to take to better prepare the United States‚Äîand the world‚Äîfor detecting and responding to a possible impact. NASA has been directed by Congress to catalogue and characterize all NEOs bigger than 140 meters, the ones that could be catastrophic. NASA is approximately 35% complete for NEOs 140 meters and larger, and approximately 96% complete for those 1 km and larger. Strategic investments in our space-based programs will lead to the benefit of all of humanity as we continue to catalogue any NEOs that pose a potential threat. This particular asteroid‚Äôs trajectory has been well tracked by NASA‚Äôs Center for Near-Earth Object Studies since it‚Äôs discovery 13 years and poses no hazard to impacting Earth.Here's a little more information about near-earth objects from CNEOS. The organization writes on its website (emphasis ours):¬†On a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth‚Äôs surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth‚Äôs surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth‚Äôs surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.With an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth‚Äôs surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth‚Äôs surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories ...... No one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.NASA Near-Earth Object Observations Program is constantly monitoring the skies for approaching asteroids and meteors. So far, the program has discovered more than 19,000 NEOs. When NASA discovers an NEO, it works to determine as much information as possible about the object, such as its size, speed, and orbit, so that the agency can calculate when it will approach Earth and how close it will come when it does.¬†But the 19,000 NEOs in NASA's database aren't really what we have to worry about. The organization writes that thousands of NEOs have yet to be discovered:Asteroid impacts are a continuously occurring natural process. Every day, 80 to 100 tons of material falls upon Earth from space in the form of dust and small meteorites (fragments of asteroids that disintegrate in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere). Over the past 20 years, U.S. government sensors have detected nearly 600 very small asteroids a few meters in size that have entered Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and created spectacular bolides (fireballs). Experts estimate that an impact of an object the size of the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 ‚Äì approximately 55 feet (17 meters) in size ‚Äì takes place once or twice a century. Impacts of larger objects are expected to be far less frequent (on the scale of centuries to millennia). However, given the current incompleteness of the NEO catalogue, an unpredicted impact ‚Äì such as the Chelyabinsk event ‚Äì could occur at any time.Still, the chances of an asteroid larger than 140 meters hitting earth in the next 100 years is minimal:The current congressionally directed objective of the NEO Observations Program is to find, track, and characterize at least 90 percent of the predicted number of NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size‚Äìlarger than a small football stadium‚Äìand to characterize a subset representative of the entire population. Objects of this size and larger pose a risk to Earth of greatest concern due to the level of devastation an impact would cause, and should continue to be the focus of global search efforts. While no known asteroid larger than 140 meters in size has a significant chance to hit Earth for the next 100 years, less than half of the estimated 25,000 NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size have been found to date."	false
1607	The Australian government's Threatened Species Strategy has as one of its aims the culling of 2 million feral cats by 2020, largely using a sausage bait carrying a lethal toxin.	"In April 2019, several news articles from around the world reported that the Australian government had a plan to cull millions of feral cats using poisoned sausages dropped by air. CBS News published an article with the headline ""Australia is Trying to Kill Millions of Stray Cats by Airdropping Poisoned Sausages,"" which went on to report that:""The Australian government wants to kill two million feral cats by next year ‚Äî and it wants to do it by airdropping poisonous sausages. There are currently an estimated 2 to 6 million free-roaming cats across the country, and officials say they are threatening native wildlife populations.""¬†On 29 April, the UK Independent published an article with the headline ""Australia Plans to Kill Millions of Feral Cats by Airdropping Sausages Laced With Poison"" and on 26 April CNN reported that:""Australia is at war ‚Äî with feral cats. By 2020, the government wants to kill two million free roaming cats, a large chunk of the total feral cat population, which is estimated to be between 2 and 6 million.""We received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of these reports, and in particular about the claim that the primary or exclusive culling method was to be sausages laced with poison. The Australian government has indeed begun an initiative aimed at culling millions of feral cats, which they have described as ""one of the greatest threats to Australia‚Äôs land-based mammals"" and blamed for driving some species into extinction.However, the culling project was first announced in 2015 and was already well underway when reports happened to emerge about it in April 2019.In 2015, Australia's government launched the Threatened Species Strategy. One of its four key strategies related to feral cats, and the policy outlined a target of culling 2 million such cats by the year 2020 and eradicating feral cats entirely from five of Australia's islands, among other goals. A government report launching the initiative stated that:""The scientific evidence is unequivocal that feral cats are one of the greatest threats to Australia‚Äôs land-based mammals. They have been a major contributor to the extinction of at least 27 mammals since they were first introduced to Australia. Today, they imperil at least 142 species or more than one third of our threatened mammals, reptiles, frogs and birds. As an extinction driver for so many of our native animals, and a threat that has been relatively neglected in the past, tackling the threat of feral cats is the highest priority of this Action Plan.""By the end of 2016, researchers from RMIT University in Melbourne reported that an estimated 211,000 feral cats had been culled as part of the initiative, but also estimated that 83 percent of those animals had been shot, rather than poisoned. More up-to-date figures were not included in the progress report relating to the period ending in December 2017.¬†In order to achieve the goal of eradicating 2 million feral cats, the first action listed by the government was the ""development and deployment of Curiosity, the new humane feral cat bait."" Australia's Department of Environment and Energy had spent years developing and testing Curiosity, a new form of sausage bait that, according to the government, is less likely than existing baits to be consumed by other animals:The Curiosity bait for feral cats has been a long-term $5.1 million project to develop a humane, broad-scale toxic bait to control feral cats in conservation areas. The Curiosity bait for feral cats comprises a small meat-based sausage containing a small hard plastic pellet encapsulating a humane toxin. Cats do not have molar teeth and tend to chew their food less so they may swallow portions of the sausage including the pellet. Most Australian native animals nibble and chew their food and are likely to reject the pellet. The pellet is designed to dissolve in the cat‚Äôs stomach and deliver a rapid dose of the toxin.The Curiosity bait for feral cats uses a new humane toxin called para-aminopropiophenone, or PAPP, which is considered best-practice world-wide. In brief, the toxicant, PAPP, converts the animal‚Äôs red blood cells to a form that cannot carry oxygen, causing death through oxygen starvation to the brain and other vital organs. It is considered to be humane and death takes minutes to hours. The RSPCA [Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] have indicated that PAPP is a clear improvement in humaneness over previous toxins. The mode of action means that secondary poisoning of any other animals from consuming a carcass of a cat that ate a Curiosity bait containing PAPP is much less likely than when using previously employed toxins.(Although the excerpt serves to explain the Australian government's reasoning in favoring the Curiosity bait, it does contain a factual error: cats do have molar teeth, albeit only two, and they are used for tearing flesh rather than grinding, so the overall claim that cats tend to chew less and swallow more readily than other animals, appears to stand).¬†In government-commissioned field trials of Curiosity, the bait has been distributed on the ground in target areas using both aircraft and ground vehicles.As of April 2019, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority was still assessing the PAPP variant of Curiosity. But the national government appeared confident it would be registered as a pest-control product, because in November 2018 the Department of the Environment and Energy solicited applications for a commercial partner to manufacture and sell the bait.Although no significant developments in relation to the culling program took place in the spring of 2019, interest in the initiative was revived by a 25 April article published by The New York Times, which bore the headline ""Australia is Deadly Serious About Killing Millions of Cats,"" and mentioned the existing use of another kind of sausage-borne cat bait containing the active ingredient sodium fluoroacetate, known as ""1080.""¬†In February 2019, a group of Australian scientists questioned the basis of the government's target of culling 2 million feral cats by 2020, in part saying the government had not given a clear metric or scientific rationale for that number; had failed to indicate how or whether the cull would lower the overall population of feral cats (given the rapid rates at which they reproduce) and also increase the populations of endangered species; and because estimates vary widely over how many feral cats actually live in Australia.

6193	Over the course of his career, Democratic Congressman Joe Kennedy has received $348,000 in campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical industry.	"In January 2018, Rep. Joe Kennedy III attracted scrutiny from both left-wing and right-wing observers, after he was designated to give the official Democratic response to President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address in January 2018.¬†On 28 January 2018, this meme¬†appeared, making claims about the Massachusetts Congressman's purported links to the pharmaceutical industry, and his record on several major issues:This is Joe. Pharmaceutical companies have given Joe $348K since 2011. Joe has $434K of stock in a company charging $1,000 per pill for a live-saving drug. Joe opposes legal marijuana and universal healthcare legislation. Don't be like Joe.¬†Pharmaceutical industry donationsAn article¬†from GritPost.com elaborated on these claims:Rep. Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) might be pharma‚Äôs favorite Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, given that he‚Äôs received¬†more than $57,000¬†from the pharmaceutical/health products industry in this current election cycle alone. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, that‚Äôs approximately¬†four times more¬†than pharma‚Äôs average contribution to House Democrats. Over the course of his short Congressional career, Kennedy has received¬†more than $348,000 since 2011.The source of these claims about contributions to Kennedy is the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington, DC-based non-profit that tracks political donations on the web site Open Secrets.¬†The figures in the article are accurate; the industry's contributions to Kennedy total $348,077 over the course of his six-year¬†career as a politician.Investments in pharmaceuticalsThe Grit Post article and the meme also allege Kennedy had personal investments in a controversial pharmaceutical company. Grit Post writes:As the Boston Globe reported last year, Rep. Kennedy has¬†more than $434,000 invested¬†in Gilead Sciences, Inc. Gilead is the manufacturer of life-saving hepatitis C drug Sovaldi ‚Äî which Gilead recently¬†increased to $1,000 per pill, or $84,000 for a treatment.¬†While it's true Kennedy has investments in Gilead, this claim is slightly misleading and out of date.In May 2016, the Boston Globe reported that the Congressman had ""earned stock value of up to $434,999 from investments in Gilead Sciences Inc"" and furthermore:His holdings in Gilead, as of the end of 2015, totaled between $180,004 and $450,000, according to financial disclosures.So actually, Kennedy's investments in Gilead could have been as low as $180,004 at the time of the Boston Globe article in May 2016. The Globe was careful to point out that members of Congress¬†are not required to provide exact figures for their personal investments and assets, but rather ranges. Grit Post left out this detail.¬†In any event, Kennedy provided a more up-to-date financial disclosure at the end of 2016, which showed his investments in Gilead by then totalled between $80,003 and $200,000.¬†Financial disclosures for 2017 have not yet been published.¬†Whatever the exact amounts involved, Kennedy's investment in Gilead has been controversial largely because the company sells Solvadi, its brand name for the drug sofosbuvir, which is used to treat Hepatitis C. As Grit Post points out, Gilead Sciences has attracted criticism for the high price of Solvadi which is $1,000 per pill or $84,000 for a course of treatment.Kennedy's investment is part of a trust fund managed by a financial adviser. Craig Holman, from the advocacy group Public Citizen, told the Globe in 2016 that the profits Kennedy and the company were making were ""harming many of the citizens of Massachusetts.""According to Open Secrets, 19 members of Congress (as well as Donald Trump) held shares in Gilead Sciences in 2015.¬†Stance on marijuanaThe Grit Post meme's claim that Kennedy opposes marijuana legalization is accurate. While the national conversation has shifted to discuss recreational marijuana's legalization, over the years many leaders have come to voice support for the medical uses for marijuana.However, Kennedy not only opposes recreational use, but he has a record of voting against measures to protect and enhance access to medical marijuana. In 2015, Kennedy was one of 10 Democrats who sided with a Republican majority to pass a bill that would‚Äîamong many other things‚Äîrestrict funding for states that wanted to legalize marijuana. The bill died in Senate.Grit Post also correctly pointed out that Kennedy, in a 2016 interview,¬†said ""I don't think marijuana should be legalized.""Stance on universal healthcareThe meme's claim that Kennedy opposes ""universal healthcare legislation"" requires closer examination.In September 2017, Kennedy expressed tentative support for a single-payer healthcare system, but hesitated to support bills¬†then before the House of Representatives and Senate that would have expanded Medicare.¬†At the time, Kennedy told Boston Public Radio the bills were ""100 percent right on the value that they're trying to enshrine into federal law -- that healthcare is a right in this country, not a privilege to be enjoyed by the few...""However, he said there were ""details"" in the House bill (introduced by Democratic Rep. John Conyers) with which he was 'struggling.'When pressed, Kennedy said he supported universal healthcare, but said a single-payer system (funded by taxes and administered by the government) was ""a way that we could get there, and that's great, but I think that the critical piece to this is ensuring that everybody gets access to quality, affordable, accessible healthcare..."""	true

1491	NASA provided $1.1 million in funding to a religious organization to study how humans may react to life beyond Earth.	"It is true that NASA provided funding to the Center for Theological Inquiry in 2015 to address the societal implications of astrobiology and life beyond Earth. However, the NASA-funded portion of the research concluded in 2017 and the space agency was not involved in the selection of researchers involved in the study, nor were any of the scientists involved directly employed by NASA.NASA made new headlines in late 2021 for an old program that supposedly funded an effort to understand how humans would react to life beyond our home planet. While the hunt for alien life isn‚Äôt anything new, the take on the search was: The space agency was said by publications like the New York Post to have hired theologians to ‚Äúto understand how humans will react to news that intelligent life exists on other planets.‚ÄùThe story picked up speed in late December and was covered by a number of publications. It also made for an interesting gab on social media:And while the claim is largely true, it is based on events that happened years ago. In an email to Snopes, NASA confirmed that it had partially funded research conducted by the nonprofit organization Center for Theological Inquiry (CTI), in Princeton, New Jersey. (The institution is not affiliated with the university as some publications reported.) But the grant ended after two years and the space agency was not involved in the selection of researchers involved in the study, nor were any of the scientists directly employed by NASA‚ÄúAddressing the societal implications of astrobiology and, specifically, the potential societal impact of finding life beyond Earth, has been a goal of NASA since 1998,‚Äù a spokesperson told Snopes.‚ÄúThe agency's Astrobiology program provided partial funding through a grant to the CTI in 2015 to assess societal implications for NASA‚Äôs astrobiological and search for life efforts.‚ÄùNASA further noted that the researchers involved in the study were selected exclusively by CTI.‚ÄúNASA was not involved in the selection of researchers for this study, and individuals who receive grant funding from NASA are not employees, advisors, or spokespersons for the agency,‚Äù said the spokesperson. ‚ÄúThus, the researchers and scholars involved with this study were not hired by NASA, but instead received funding through CTI to conduct this work.‚ÄùIn an email to Snopes, CTI specified that its research was not a search for aliens, nor did its scientists work for or advise NASA on that topic. Rather, the work focused on ""the scientific study of the potential of the Universe to harbor microbial life beyond Earth.""""The grant was awarded to enable scholars in the Humanities to become conversant with the current science of astrobiology, and to study its implications for humanity‚Äôs views of the natural world in religion and society,"" a spokesperson told Snopes. They added that the work is available in the institution's magazine, Fresh Thinking (Issue No. 1, 2018, pages 32-45; Issue No. 2, 2019, pages 6 to 15).The story originated on Dec. 22, 2021, when the United Kingdom-based newspaper The Times published an interview with a British priest, Reverend Andrew Davidson, who was among 24 theologians to have taken part in the NASA-sponsored program. Davidson was speaking to his upcoming book, ‚ÄúAstrobiology and Christian Doctrine,‚Äù set to be published in 2022.A blog stub published by the University of Cambridge further confirmed the work in collaboration with NASA. Davidson, who was a Starbridge Lecturer in Theology and Natural Science at the time of the study, described is project as ‚Äúeasy to define.‚Äù‚ÄúI am researching and writing a survey of the main topics in Christian belief ‚Äî what is sometimes called ‚Äòsystematic theology‚Äô ‚Äî from the perspective of life elsewhere in the universe. I am thinking about its bearing on the doctrines of creation, sin, the person and work of Jesus, redemption, revelation, eschatology, and so on,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúI see my main task as identifying, and working with, parts of the theological tradition that could bear directly upon the topic, even though they have not yet been brought to bear‚Ä¶ So far, my attention has mainly been focused on what theologians call Christology: the discussion of who Jesus was, and in particular of what it would mean to hold that he is both human and divine.‚ÄùCTI described itself as ‚Äúconvening theologians and researchers in the humanities and sciences to think together on God and global concerns.‚Äù But at the time of the initial funding, the question over whether government funds ought to be allocated to a religious institution, specifically one of Christian orientation, was a controversial one. A letter written by the freedom from Religion Foundation in June 2016 formally requested that NASA rescind the grant, calling it ‚Äúboth unconstitutional and unnecessary‚Äù and an ‚Äúegregious misuse of secular tax dollars.‚ÄùSnopes contacted CTI for more information about the findings of the research but did not receive a response as of this writing. We will update the article accordingly. However, an article published by Davidson in 2018 in the journal Theology and Science described his research:Christian theologians have considered the significance of life elsewhere in the cosmos since the fifteenth century, but the brevity of these discussions calls for greater theological precision: the notion of multiple incarnations, for example, is often explored without reference to the detail of Christological formulations. Attention to the logical mode in which such work is set out is also fruitful, where the scholastic category of suitability or fittingness holds particular promise. As suitable, God‚Äôs actions are free and yet congruent, being consistent with the divine nature, with creaturely natures, and with the ends of God‚Äôs dealings with creatures."	true
4860	The U.S. Constitution states that if a president is impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate, that person's first term is nullified and they are eligible to run for office two more times.	"As talk of impeachment flooded the internet in September 2019, we came across two rumors concerning the impact of the impeachment process on President Donald Trump's reelection opportunities.The first held that a president who was impeached by the House, but not convicted by the Senate, could run for office two more times because the failed impeachment would nullify the first term. The second posited that if the House votes to impeach a president, but the Senate doesn't convict and remove the person from office, the president is barred from running for office again.¬†We'll take a look at each of those theories below. But first, a quick look at how the impeachment process works. People often use the word ""impeachment"" when referring to the removal of a president from office. But that's not exactly how it works. The House of Representatives has the ""sole Power of Impeachment,"" as stated in Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution. But it is up to the Senate to convict and remove a president from office. In this way, ""impeachment"" is roughly akin to bringing formal charges against an individual. It is then up to the Senate to convict the individual on those charges.¬†The aforementioned theories both deal with the gray area between impeachment and conviction. In other words, what happens if the president is impeached by the House of Representatives but is not convicted by the Senate?Theory 1: If a president is impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate, the first presidential term is nullified and the president may run for election two more times. FALSE: This theory has been posited by a few social media users, but it reached a larger audience when it was shared by pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec:The tweet reads: ""These Democrats don't realize that if they impeach Trump and the Senate doesn't confirm it then it nullifies Trump's first term and he gets to run two more times. Read the Constitution, people.""¬†This is not how impeachment works.¬†Before we get to what the Constitution says about impeachment, we can get a glimpse of the hypothetical scenario posited in this tweet by taking a quick look at our country's recent history.President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on Dec. 19, 1998. However, Clinton was not convicted by the Senate. We searched news reports from the time and found no serious reporters, historians, or politicians arguing that the Senate's failure to convict Clinton literally nullified the president's previous term and gave him the opportunity to run for office again.¬†The Associated Press reported on Feb. 12, 1999:The Senate today acquitted William Jefferson Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, ending a 13-month drama that catapulted an affair with a White House intern into only the second presidential impeachment trial in history. Permitted to finish his term, the 42nd president declared he was ""profoundly sorry ... for what I said and did.""""This can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and renewal for America,"" Clinton said in a brief statement from the White House Rose Garden about two hours after the historic verdict.Chief Justice William Rehnquist pronounced Clinton‚Äôs acquittal at 12:39 EST. ""It is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said William Jefferson Clinton be and he hereby is acquitted of the charges in the said articles,"" he intoned.The process for impeachment is laid out in Article I and Article II of the U.S. Constitution. This text says nothing about a president's term being ""nullified"" by an impeachment proceeding. Furthermore, the 22nd amendment of the Constitution explicitly states that ""no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.""Doug Pennington, director of communication for the Constitutional Accountability Center, told us in an email that Posobiec's statement was false:The 22d Amendment alone unequivocally disproves that ridiculous, dangerous claim. The first words of the Amendment state: ""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice ‚Ä¶."" Donald Trump has been elected once. Provided he isn‚Äôt convicted by the Senate in an impeachment trial and disqualified from holding future office, he can run for a second term, and only a second term.That‚Äôs enough to negate that dreadful tweet, but anyone who considered some version of that question in good faith would have looked anywhere ‚Äî literally anywhere ‚Äî in the Constitution for textual support for the belief that if ""[1] they impeach Trump and [2] the Senate doesn't confirm it then [3] it nullifies Trump's first term and [4] he gets to run two more times."" Having found absolutely none, instead coming across Article I Section 3 and the 22d Amendment, among other sections, such a good-faith questioner would have concluded that the opposite is true, and would not have made such a claim publicly for fear of spreading disinformation.Theory 2: A president is barred from seeking a second term once impeached. MOSTLY FALSE: A number of social media users seem to be under the impression that Trump would not be able to seek reelection if the House of Representatives impeaches him. One Twitter user, for instance, wrote: ""If he gets impeached he won‚Äôt be able to run in the next election like he plans to. It would guarantee that we can‚Äôt have 4 more years under his leadership.""But that isn't the case. A president who is impeached by the House but is not convicted by the Senate could still run for reelection.¬†Pennington told us: ""Nothing in the Constitution‚Äôs language on impeachment prevents a president impeached but not convicted from running for a second of a two-term maximum.""In fact, before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry into Trump in September 2019, political pundits noted that a ""failed"" impeachment could help Trump's reelection efforts.An opinion piece in The Hill noted:If the Democratic majority in the House impeaches the president without broad political consensus in the Senate (and country) to convict the president and remove him from office, impeachment will be weaponized by the president in the 2020 campaign. Trump will argue that liberal Democrats and the news media are out to get him, that he has done nothing wrong, and that you can‚Äôt impeach a president who has done a great job. This mantra will play well with his loyal base.However, a bit of truth is offered here. The Constitution explains the country has two penalties for impeachment: removal from office and disqualification ""to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States."" If a president is impeached by the House of Representatives, the Senate could convict, remove the president from office, and disqualify the person from holding future office.¬†This scenario, however, falls into some gray area because it has never been tested at the presidential level. It is possible that the Senate could take two separate votes, one on removal from office and one on disqualification from future office, which could result in a president's removal from office but provide an opportunity to seek reelection. It's also theoretically possible that a president who has been impeached, convicted, removed, and disqualified, could seek office at a lower level of government.¬†We asked Pennington about the possibility of a president seeking reelection after the House has impeached and the Senate convicted the person. He told us:¬†A convicted president can be prohibited from again holding office¬†if the Senate so decides, per¬†Article I Section 3, which includes: ‚ÄúJudgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.‚Äù Disqualification is not automatic, but up to the Senate‚Äôs discretion.While unsettled, a strong argument exists, however, that members of Congress are not encompassed by the language ‚ÄúOffice of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.‚Äù If so, then perhaps an impeached president could run for the House or Senate. It‚Äôs untested.Additionally, some¬†argue¬†(at fn. 23) that an impeached and convicted official who the Senate decided to disqualify from holding future office, per Article 1 Section 3 above, would¬†not¬†be disqualified from holding a state office. Again, untested.More confident saying that a Senate disqualifying a president from holding office after an impeachment conviction would at least prohibit him/her from holding a federal office in either the executive or judicial branches, and at least possibly congressional or state office.To sum up: Although a president is impeached by the House of Representatives, the repercussions of this legal process don't come to fruition until the Senate votes to convict the president.If that happens, the Senate can vote to remove the president from office and disqualify the person from holding future office. If the Senate does not convict, the president will not be removed from office, nor will the person be prevented from seeking reelection (if he/she has not already reached the two-term limit)."	false
6090	In Iowa, blind people are legally allowed to own and possess firearms.	"In the aftermath of a February 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, gun control and gun rights became the focus, once again, of intensive scrutiny and debate in the United States. In that climate, internet users began sharing news articles reporting that the state of Iowa was issuing gun permits to people who are legally blind. Many of those sharing the articles appeared to believe that Iowa had started issuing such permits in 2018, when in fact the practice began in 2011.¬†Once such article from 2013 reported the following, prompting multiple inquiries from our readers in 2018:
Here's some news that has law enforcement officials and lawmakers scratching their heads: Iowa is granting permits to acquire or carry guns in public to people who are legally or completely blind. No one questions the legality of the permits. State law does not allow sheriffs to deny an Iowan the right to carry a weapon based on physical ability.
It is true that Iowa law allows for the granting of gun permits to individuals who are legally or completely blind, although technically it was not previously the case that blind people were explicitly barred from owning firearms on the basis of their visual impairments. A change in regulations (implemented in 2011, not 2018) made it easier for persons with limited sight or other physical disabilities to acquire gun permits and provided licensing authorities less leeway in deciding whether, and to whom, they would issue permits.SF 2379, a 2010 law passed by the Iowa General Assembly, removed a previously existing requirement that anyone applying for a permit must first undergo training on a firing range.  This prerequisite had historically discouraged people with physical disabilities, including visual impairments, from applying for gun permits.A spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Public Safety (DPS) told us by email that the 2010 change also limited the extent to which county sheriffs and the DPS could exercise discretion in issuing licenses, adjusting the language in the law from ""may issue"" to ""shall issue.""
Given that on and after 1 January 2011, permit issuing officers must issue permits to an applicant who meets eligibility criteria specified by law, and given that the training requirement written into statutory law does not require qualification on a range, we are aware of several instances in which a person with a significant visual impairment applied for and was issued a permit since 1 January 2011.It is NOT the case that Iowa once had a visual acuity test or standard for weapons permit purposes, and later repealed such requirement. Instead, Iowa has not had a visual acuity test or standard under either current or prior law.
Despite concerns expressed by many people about the public safety implications of granting gun licenses to the blind, the DPS spokesperson noted that ""We are not aware of any instance in which a person with a significant visual impairment has used a firearm in a fashion that caused damage, injury, or death.""This observation was echoed by Josh Hammen, Deputy Sheriff of Pocahontas County and President of the Iowa State Sheriffs' and Deputies' Association.  Speaking to us by phone, Hammen said he had not been made aware of any cases where a gun owner with a visual impairment had been involved in any firearms-related death or injury since 2011."	true

116	The 1960 writers‚Äô and actors‚Äô strike resulted in healthcare, pensions, and residuals on broadcast film.	"On July 13, 2023, the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), the union representing Hollywood actors and performers, voted to go on strike against major studios after contract negotiations broke down. They joined the Writers Guild of America (WGA), the union representing screenwriters who had been picketing since May 2023. This was the first joint strike of writers and actors since 1960. ¬†Director and screenwriter Boots Riley noted on Twitter, ""The last time actors and writers were on strike together, in 1960, is how we got health care, pension, and residuals on broadcast film. That didn't exist in the film and TV industry until then. A lot is possible with this kind of solidarity and this is the perfect time for it.""The last time actors and writers were on strike together, in 1960-is how we got health care, pension, and residuals on broadcast film.That didnt exist in the film and TV industry until then.A lot is possible with this kind of solidarity and this is the perfect time for it.‚Äî Boots Riley (@BootsRiley) July 19, 2023¬†Riley is correct that the 1960 joint writers and actors strike resulted in healthcare, pensions, and access to residuals that resulted from films being shown on television.¬†We should note, however, that each union achieved¬†similar goals within different timeframes and negotiated separate contracts for film and television work. At the time, the Association of Motion Picture Producers represented the bigger studios and production houses for film contracts, while the Alliance of Television Film Producers handled small-screen contracts. Today, all union contracts go through the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.¬†In 1960, the writers began striking¬†in January and the actors followed in March. The WGA was on strike for 153 days, according to the Associated Press, and the actor's union‚Äî then just SAG ‚Äî was on strike for 43 days.¬†Residuals were at the heart of both of the guilds' demands, with the advent of television resulting in writers and actors wanting bigger cuts of the revenue from films sold to television, as well as better health benefits and pensions. Writers demanded studios contribute money to the WGA health and pension funds, as well as increased wages and residuals related to their work being shown on television, or via television reruns. Actors had similar demands, striking primarily over residuals from films sold to television networks.¬†In the 1950s, the WGA and the Directors Guild of America (DGA) had secured through various contract battles some pension and healthcare plans for workers, something SAG wanted to establish, as well. However, the 1960 strike resulted in the establishment of the WGA's first independent pension fund and participation in an industry-wide health insurance plan. According to the WGA website, gains also included ""the first residuals for theatrical motion pictures, paying 1.2% of the license fee when features were licensed to television.""SAG‚Äîled by Ronald Reagan before he went into politics‚Äî secured studio money that allowed for the formal establishment of pension, health and welfare funds. This victory took place just before the WGA and DGA opened the doors for members to join their hard-fought pension and healthcare benefits plan on March 31, 1960. ¬†The studios, however, did not budge on SAG's demands that their actors receive 2% of the revenue from post-1948 film sales to television. They did, however, agree to a royalty-payment system for television-licensing revenue for films produced after Jan. 31, 1960. According to Variety, the studios agreed to contribute an extra 5% of all film and television salaries into the health and pension fund. Additionally, in what seemed to be an exchange for not getting a cut of the post-1948 movie-to-television revenues, the studios gave another $2.6 million in total payments to SAG, to recognize seasoned actors' ""past service"" to the industry. This amount was used to create SAG's pension and welfare plan, according to its website.¬†Not everyone was happy with the agreements, with many actors¬†grumbling that Reagan folded too quickly and that they could have retroactively received payments for pre-1960 films.¬†The 1960 action was the first of its kind, where two key groups went on a strike in an industry where unions had major divisions. According to a Washington Post analysis of the 1960 strike by film and television experts Miranda Banks and Kate Fortmueller, workers in physical production resented the strike, as they were hurt by film shutdowns. Disunity within the guilds also led to concessions, in which writers and actors had to forgo their backpay for past films to ensure future earnings.¬†They observed that even as guilds faced disagreements within their ranks, the 1960 battle ""foreshadowed how the unions for writers and actors eventually would become reliable allies, recognizing the necessity of unity as studios and networks became branches of media conglomerates starting in the 1980s."""	true

5491	"A van belonging to the suspect arrested in the October 2018 series of mail bombings was created as part of a ""false flag"" plot."	"On 26 October 2018, a 56-year-old Florida resident named Cesar Sayoc was arrested on suspicion of having mailed a series of explosive devices to Democratic officials and other critics of President Trump over the previous several days.  A post-arrest look into Sayoc's background quickly revealed that he appeared to be an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, having attended at least two Trump rallies in Florida and driving a van whose windows were festooned with pro-Trump stickers:Even before Sayoc's arrest, Trump supporters and assorted conspiracy buffs had already been pushing a theory that the mail bombs ""were not actually part of a plot to harm Democrats, but were a 'false flag' operation concocted by leftists in order to paint conservatives as violent radicals ahead of the [midterm] elections"":
A range of high-profile conservatives have embraced a conspiracy theory that mail bombs sent to liberal public figures are a ‚Äúfalse flag‚Äù attack by leftwingers. Many have also claimed that the attacks are intended to elicit sympathy for Democrats ahead of the looming midterm elections.Authorities are yet to identify a suspect or motive in the bombings, which have seen 12 pipe bombs sent to a range of figures from former president Barack Obama to Bill and Hillary Clinton to financier George Soros and even to the out-spoken actor Robert De Niro. All the suspects have one thing in common: they have been targets of Donald Trump‚Äôs ire.Nevertheless, without evidence, a number of ostensibly mainstream conservatives joined more overtly conspiracist outlets in either expressing skepticism that conservatives would damage their own cause, or making outright accusations that the left are orchestrating the bombing campaign in order to sabotage Republicans.
Not dissuaded by the evidence when a suspect was finally taken into custody, the conspiracy theorists quickly disclaimed evidence such as Sayoc's van, maintaining that it was too obviously ""staged"":The ""staged van"" claim had a fatal flaw to it, though: south Florida residents had been spotting and photographing Sayoc's unusual van with its collection of pro-Trump stickers for up to a year before his arrest.  The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, for example, reported on the many locals who had observed Sayoc and his prominent vehicle around town long before the wave of mail bombings and his subsequent arrest:
From Aventura to Hollywood to Davie and farther, people have gawked and photographed the oddball vehicle for some time.‚ÄúI saw this van dozens of times. It always struck me, always unsettled me. It appeared that somebody at times was in the van, though it was hard to tell because of the windows,‚Äù said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer who co-produced 2006‚Äôs ‚ÄúCocaine Cowboys.‚Äù‚ÄúThis is also Miami and you don‚Äôt know ‚Äî this guy‚Äôs an enthusiastic Trump supporter, that‚Äôs one thing, but the number of stickers he had on his car combined with some of the more threatening stickers seemed to indicate this might be a person with a problem you don‚Äôt want to confront directly, especially in Miami, where you don‚Äôt know if anybody‚Äôs armed.‚ÄùCypkin encountered the van regularly when he lived near the Shoppes at the Waterways in Aventura, where it was regularly parked. Cypkin believed someone could be living in the van, and finally, on the morning of New Year‚Äôs Eve 2017, he snapped a few quick pictures so he could get a better look at some of the stickers later.‚ÄúI had seen it there at least a year,‚Äù Cypkin said. ‚ÄúI did see someone standing at the back one time, with one of the back doors open. I didn‚Äôt make eye contact.‚ÄùIn Davie, people frequently saw the van outside Whole Foods, and Geo Rodriguez, a former South Florida Sun Sentinel reporter, came across it in front of Papa John‚Äôs pizza in Hollywood.On April 6, he stepped outside a 7-11 and saw the van, parked on the swale next to Hollywood Boulevard, in front of the Papa John‚Äôs. Several readers said they have seen the van delivering pizza.I‚Äôve seen him off and on. You can tell he‚Äôs from around here,‚Äù Rodriguez said. ‚ÄúI see him at the Publix here in Hollywood all the time. He‚Äôs kind of like a fixture.‚Äù
In fact, as exemplified by the following Vice article excerpt, some commenters began debating after Sayoc's arrest whether his van shouldn't have been called to the attention of law enforcement authorities well before he allegedly began sending explosive devices through the mail:
After media outlets broadcast images of Sayoc‚Äôs ride being impounded by FBI agents, Miami locals began posting photos of the van taken as far back as last winter ...But even as the inflammatory rhetoric on the windows of Sayoc‚Äôs van attracted the curiosity of nervous onlookers, conversations with federal law enforcement and free speech experts suggested the decals and the messaging alone likely did not represent actionable criminal conduct. In other words, despite hate crimes being on the rise and the majority of extremist violence being carried out by right-wing white supremacists, a violence-adorned MAGA van is almost certainly just that: a vehicle some Americans might find objectionable.‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do anything about the stickers and the decals,‚Äù Chris Quick, a former FBI joint terrorism task force agent, told me. ‚ÄúThat is free speech. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it was one or 20 stickers.‚Äù

5608	Rep. Maxine Waters is facing ethics violations charges for improperly setting up a meeting between officials from the Treasury and OneUnited bank.	"For years, bottom-feeding YouTube channels and blogs have seemingly attempted to gin up anger against Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California, treating a 2010 dispute as if it were current news.Specifically, these sites have seized on reports from August 2010 that Waters was facing ethics charges in connection with a meeting held two years earlier between officials from OneUnited Bank and U.S. Treasury officials. At the time of the meeting, Waters' husband held stock in OneUnited and had been on its board of directors.A House ethics panel determined in September 2012 that Waters did not violate any ethics rules. But that has not stopped various web sites from both ignoring that fact and passing the charges off as recent.

1740	Rust causes tetanus.	Rust does not cause tetanus. This notion stems from the oft-repeated claim that stepping on a rusty nail will give you the disease. There are valid scientific reasons, discussed below, for using a rusty nail as an example of the kind of injury that could potentially result in tetanus; but chemically and medically speaking, the rust has nothing to do with it.Rusty nails can pierce the skin and have likely been left abandoned in soil for some amount of time. The bacterium that does cause tetanus (Clostridium tetani)¬†is fairly ubiquitous in soil. A rusty nail, the logic goes, has likely been in contact with soil for a longer period of time than a fresh one, and ‚Äî thanks to the rough surface created by the rust ‚Äî has ample space to collect and harbor that bacteria:If you have been injured outside or in any way that makes contact with soil likely, contact your provider about your risk of getting a tetanus infection. Injuries and wounds should be thoroughly cleaned right away. If the tissue of the wound is dying, a doctor will need to remove the tissue.You may have heard that you can get tetanus if you are injured by a rusty nail. This is true only if the nail is dirty and has the tetanus bacteria on it. It is the dirt on the nail, not the rust that carries the risk of tetanus.C. tetania are spore-forming bacteria. In spore form, they are able to survive in the presence of some oxygen, but in the growth stage of life they require an oxygen-free environment to live and develop. As spores, they can be found both in soil and in the intestinal tracts of many animals. If these spores enter the body through an open wound, however, they can germinate in the more anaerobic areas of the human body, creating a toxin that spreads through a person‚Äôs muscular and circulatory systems before ultimately disrupting a victim's central nervous system itself:C. tetani usually enters the body through a wound. In the presence of anaerobic (low oxygen) conditions, the spores germinate. Toxins are produced and disseminated via blood and lymphatics. Toxins act at several sites within the central nervous system, including peripheral motor end plates, spinal cord, and brain, and in the sympathetic nervous system.The typical clinical manifestations of tetanus are caused when tetanus toxin interferes with release of neurotransmitters, blocking inhibitor impulses. This leads to unopposed muscle contraction and spasm. Seizures may occur, and the autonomic nervous system may also be affected.Tetanospasmin is a potent neurotoxin, and the symptoms it can create in those who develop tetanus are a chilling reminder of that fact:Trismus (lockjaw) ‚Äî the inability to open the mouth fully owing to rigidity of the [muscles used for chewing]‚Äîis often the first symptom. [...] Generalised tetanus is the most common form of the disease, and presents with pain, headache, stiffness, rigidity, [an involuntary backward arching of the head, neck, and spine], and spasms, which can lead to laryngeal obstruction.These may be induced by minor stimuli such as noise, touch, or by simple medical and nursing procedures such as intravenous and intramuscular injections, suction, or catheterisation. The spasms are excruciatingly painful and may be uncontrollable leading to respiratory arrest and death.While tetanus cases remain common in developing countries, the success of the tetanus vaccine, which uses an inactivated form of tetanospasmin to impart immunity against the toxin, has resulted in steeply declining rates in the disease.	false
5493	Photographs and videos show pipe-bombing suspect Cesar Sayoc in attendance at Donald Trump rallies.	"In late October 2018, public attention turned to the background and personal circumstances of Cesar Sayoc, the 56-year-old Florida man arrested in connection with the mailing of a series of explosive devices to high-profile figures in the Democratic party, including former president Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.On Facebook and Twitter, Sayoc articulated a fervent support for President Donald Trump, promoted right-wing conspiracy theories, and engaged in vigorous criticism of some of the eventual targets of the mail bomb campaign of which he was accused.Against this backdrop, social media users and the news media shared photographs and videos that appeared to show Sayoc in attendance at rallies for Donald Trump before and after the latter's election as president, prompting inquiries from readers as to whether the images were authentic.For example, on 26 October 2018 the anti-Trump Facebook page ""Politicked"" shared a meme which included photographs of Sayoc apparently holding pro-Trump and anti-CNN signs, along with this description ""Accused MAGA bomber Cesar Sayac Jr. was a regular at Trump rallies. He was even considered a 'celebrity' among Trump fanatics. I WONDER WHO RADICALIZED HIM"":There is no doubt that Sayoc attended Trump rallies both during and after the 2016 presidential election campaign, as he posted photographic evidence of such to his own Facebook account. Since his arrest, others have retrieved and published video footage which corroborates his presence at more than one such rally.An archived version of Sayoc's Facebook profile contains multiple photographs that he himself posted, although it wasn't immediately possible to check exactly where and when the event or events shown took place:Furthermore, the web site Heavy.com compiled many more photographs taken from Sayoc's Facebook and Twitter profiles before they were removed from the social networks in the aftermath of his arrest. These included the photograph shown in the ""Politicked"" meme. In the compilation, Sayoc can be seen wearing a t-shirt which acclaims ""My President"" (a reference to Trump) and ""It was a 306 Tsunami"" (a reference to the number of electoral college votes the Republican candidate won). Moreover, Sayoc held a ""Welcome President Trump"" sign which also featured the words ""Orlando-Melbourne International Airport."" These details establish that the ""Politicked"" photograph was snapped after Trump's inauguration and strongly suggest it was taken at a February 2017 rally in Melbourne, Florida:Hard to believe Cesar Sayoc‚Äôs Facebook profile is still active... pic.twitter.com/d8qxOdHAgG‚Äî Larry B. (@larryagape) October 26, 2018On 28 October, the filmmaker Michael Moore corroborated Sayoc's attendance at the Melbourne, Florida, rally when he published raw footage from that event which he recorded during filming for what would later become his documentary Fahrenheit 11/9.Sayoc can be seen at several points in the short video, wearing the same attire as in the ""Politicked"" meme and holding a separate anti-CNN poster:ÔªøAlso in the days after Sayoc's arrest, CNN published their own raw footage from the February 2017 Melbourne rally, which again showed Sayoc holding his anti-CNN signs and wearing the same attire:For their part, CBS News posted a short video clip which Sayoc himself appears to have captured, showing his face while Trump delivers a stump speech in the background:Trump's words in the video were ""You take a look at these people, you study these people."" After consulting the Internet Archive's ""Trump Archive,"" we can confirm that then-candidate Trump delivered these lines, in this exact cadence, at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, on 13 October 2016.Trump was responding to multiple allegations of sexual assault and misconduct which were brought by women on 12 and 13 October, as shown in the following video:"	true
1772	"The American Civil Liberties Union issued a response to President Trump's 2018 State of the Union address complaining that he used the word ""America"" more than 80 times."	"On 30 January 2018, President Trump delivered his first State of the Union address, eliciting both praise and criticism, including a written response from¬†Faiz Shakir of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) condemning Trump's speech as exclusionary and divisive.In a classic case of either missing or purposely misrepresenting the point (it's hard to tell which), the right-wing web site CNS News¬†published an article (and other sites with a similar slant reposted it) declaring that the ACLU had complained that Trump repeated the word ""America"" more than 80 times during his address:The American Civil Liberties Union¬†‚Äî note the word ""American"" in its title¬†‚Äî complained Tuesday night about President Trump's repeated use of the word ""America"" in his State of the Union speech.In a written response to Trump's speech, Faiz Shakir, the ACLU's national political director, said:Tonight, President Trump said the word ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äô more than 80 times in his speech. Yet, after a divisive first year, we hear and feel how exclusionary that ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äô is, with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities, both in the courts and at the polls.In particular, the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the President‚Äôs deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let America‚Äôs Dreamers be deported.We, too, counted more than 80 instances of ""America"" (including variants such as ""American"" or ""Americans"") in a transcript¬†of the address, but that's neither here nor there. We're not shocked or dismayed, and we can only assume the political director of the ACLU wasn't shocked or dismayed, that a presidential address would contain so many references to America and Americans."	false
5170	A video shows a tiger briefly chasing a motorcycle.	"A video supposedly showing a tiger emerging from the woods to briefly chase a motorcycle went viral online near the end of June 2019:This footage was met with some skepticism as it circulated on social media. After all, this wouldn't be the first time a piece of doctored media purportedly showing a close encounter with a wild animal has gone viral. But unlike some of the fake videos and photographs we've debunked in the past, the above-displayed video showed no obvious red flags that it was fake.¬†For instance, instead of originating with an anonymous user on social media, this video comes from a seemingly authoritative source: the Facebook page for the ""Forests and Wildlife Protection Society (FAWPS),"" a nongovernmental organization from the Telangana State in India.FAWPS posted this video on 28 June 2019 along with the caption: ""A Tiger is seen chasing a bike in Muthanga Wildlife Safari in Wayanad in Kerala. Is this how the Tiger Parks are managed in India?""Furthermore, this source provided additional details about the video when news reporters asked about it. While we were unable to connect with FAWPS by publication time, a spokesperson for the Facebook group talked to the Hindustan Times and explained that the footage was taken by two forest-department officials who were patrolling the area after receiving a tip about a tiger sighting.¬†The footage itself also avoids some of the common editing tricks used to create fake footage. For instance, once the tiger comes into frame, the camera person does a good job of keeping the camera focused on the animal. An amateur filmmaker attempting to fake similar footage may employ a shakier camera that only shows the tiger a few frames at a time. This can help cover up any editing mistakes on a digitally created animal.¬†Take the following video for example. In December 2014, a video supposedly showing a bear chasing a bike through the woods went viral. That video, which was a digitally edited hoax, only gives a few brief glances at the bear:We don't see any reason to doubt the footage of a tiger briefly chasing after a motorcycle. This video was filmed by two forest officials as they rode through a wildlife sanctuary in India. While this footage may seem quite scary, conservationist Prerna Singh Bindra faulted the officers for not being cautious enough while driving through an area with tigers and claimed that the animal was ""mock charging,"" not attacking, the motorcycle as it rode through the animal's territory:"	true
2775	Soccer star Lionel Messi officially signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.	In August 2021, rumors swirled around the future of Lionel Messi, one of the greatest soccer players of all time, who broke down in tears at a press conference to announce he would be leaving FC Barcelona of Spain, for whom he had played for two decades, leading the club to extraordinary success and establishing himself as a global superstar of the sport, rivaled only by Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo.¬†According to statements issued by both the club and Messi himself, both sides had agreed a new contract for the Argentine attacking midfielder, now aged 34, the terms of which would have seen his previous salary ‚Äî reported to have be $667,000 per week ‚Äî cut in half.¬†However, strict Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules put in place by Spain soccer authorities, combined with Barcelona's dire financial straits ‚Äî the club has debts of more than ‚Ç¨1 billion ($1.2 billion) ‚Äî ultimately made the new contract impossible.Messi's previous contract expired earlier in the summer of 2021, meaning he was now a free agent, and could be signed by any other club without the need for a transfer fee to be paid. However, Messi's profile in the sport, and his likely wage demands, meant only a very small number of clubs were in a realistic position to sign him.¬†Over the weekend Aug. 6 to Aug. 8 of 2021, rumors emerged online that French giants Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) were aggressively pursuing the signing of Messi, who scored a staggering 672 goals in 778 first-team appearances at Barcelona, and won a record six Ballons d'Or ‚Äî an annual award generally considered to recognize the world's best player each year ‚Äî between 2009 and 2019.¬†¬†PSG was taken over in 2012 by the Qatari government-run Qatar Investment Authority, providing an extraordinary injection of cash and sponsorship deals that have helped drastically improve the club's fortunes in the intervening decade.The club's controversial Qatari backers also funded a series of marquee signings, including the two most expensive transfers in soccer history: that of Brazilian star Neymar from Barcelona, in August 2017 for ‚Ç¨222 million ($264 million or $293 million in 2021 terms); and that of French star Kylian Mbappe from AS Monaco, in February 2018 for ‚Ç¨180 million ($223 million or $247 million in 2021 terms).On Aug. 10, PSG further fueled speculation that its signing of Messi was imminent ‚Äî scheduling a press conference for the next morning, and posting short videos featuring the Argentinian flag and snippets of an Argentinian soccer jersey.¬†When Messi himself was greeted by PSG fans at Paris-Le Bourget airport, on the outskirts of the French capital, and at the Royal Monceau hotel, the rumors were all but officially confirmed.¬†However, the club removed any remaining doubts when, on the evening of Aug. 10, they officially confirmed Messi's move to the club on a two-year contract, with the option of a third year.In a news release posted to the club's official website, PSG wrote:[PSG] is very happy to announce the signing of Leo Messi on a two-year contract, with the option of a further year. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner is considered a legend of the sport, and a true source of inspiration for all generations, on and off the field.The signing of Leo reinforces the ambitions of PSG and offers our loyal supporters an exceptional team, which promises to bring incredible footballing moments in the years to come.¬†Messi himself further confirmed the bombshell move, providing the following statement as part of PSG's news release:	true
953	Online retail giant Amazon is ending its AmazonSmile charity program.	"Online shopping giant Amazon announced on Jan. 18, 2023, that it would be closing down its popular AmazonSmile charity program.After launching in 2013, a letter¬†from Amazon addressed to customers said, ""the program has not grown to create the impact that we had originally hoped."" With so many eligible organizations, ""our ability to have an impact was often spread too thin.""The company plans to ""wind down"" the AmazonSmile by Feb. 20, 2023, according to the letter:To help charities that have been a part of the AmazonSmile program with this transition, we will be providing them with a one-time donation equivalent to three months of what they earned in 2022 through the program, and they will also be able to accrue additional donations until the program officially closes in February. Once AmazonSmile closes, charities will still be able to seek support from Amazon customers by creating their own wish lists.The decision to end the program drew disappointment, criticism and skepticism about the reasons behind the decision, and according to Amazon's own statements, AmazonSmile has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for charities.AmazonSmile is a customer-driven giving program. It operates on a similar website (smile.amazon.com), where customers can browse products and make purchases, the same way they do on the main Amazon shopping site. By using AmazonSmile, however, they opt to donate 0.5 percent of the price of eligible products to charities they select.In 2020, the company announced that Amazon shoppers surpassed $215 million in donations, while it also says that customers have raised more than $400 million since the launch of the program in 2013.Charities that help animals were most popular with donors, while causes that focus on education, health, and disaster relief were also popular. ""Charities with a focus on civil rights and social action saw nearly 70% growth in donations from AmazonSmile in the last year,"" the company stated at that time.The causes listed by the company in its 2023 announcement as charity priorities after the closure of AmazonSmile include housing equity, computer science education for kids, food bank donations, disaster relief, and support for local nonprofits.Although the company framed the closing of the charity program as a way to more effectively donate to charitable causes, technology news site TechCrunch reported that it's part of broader cost-cutting measures, with the company laying off thousands of employees:The end of the program is going to have an impact on Amazon's bottom line in two ways. First, the company no longer has to set aside 0.5% on purchases made on AmazonSmile. Second, there were people actively working on the separate storefront, charity relationships and more. Shutting down AmazonSmile means that the company can lay off some people who were working on the program.We sent an email to Amazon asking for more information about its decision to close AmazonSmile, and will update this story when and if we receive a response."	true

""Our student pastor, Cory Wall, acknowledges that he made a poor decision and a mistake by making a sticker available that was offensive to some,"" the statement read. It also said that Wall was placed on administrative leave, wouldn't be involved in any upcoming youth activities, and that an investigation was underway.The reason why the ""i heart hot youth pastors"" sticker became a larger story was because it had been widely shared on social media.A picture of the sticker appeared to have first been posted to a private mom group on Facebook.""Any other moms have a teenager who goes to Fairview Baptist Church in Greer?,"" the Facebook post began.

1293	Adding acetone to gasoline in an effort to improve gas mileage is a good idea.	"As fuel prices go up, so does interest in various products and additives said to improve gas mileage. One of these is acetone, a widely-available solvent better known to most of us as nail polish remover. According to some, adding a few ounces of this chemical compound to a tank of gasoline will dramatically increase mileage, supposedly by assisting in the vaporization of fuel.One such example of this claim was collected via email in 2007:I have heard that adding small amounts of pure acetone to your gas can increase car mileage between 15% and 30%. Is this true? I did some further research and it appears that it enables more of the gas to burn thus increasing mileage. Are there any concerns for the engine? Any input would be appreciated.Although various claims have been made about acetone improving gas mileage by 25% or 30%, those avowals never seem to hold up to independent scrutiny: properly controlled experiments designed to measure the ballyhooed improvement fail to recognize any significant change.Curious motorists working in less controlled settings do at times seem to note an acetone-assisted improvement, yet their results are likely better chalked up to careless measurement or miscalculation, as their findings can't be reproduced in the lab. Confusing matters further is the issue that determining the effect of anything upon gasoline mileage is a bit more difficult to work out than it would seem, because so many different factors can affect the results. The same amount of fuel will produce different gas mileages on different days, depending upon variables such as the type of automobile, the weather conditions, whether the car's air conditioning was running, how fast the vehicle was driven, etc. Eliminating the effects of each of these factors from the computation is generally beyond the abilities of the average car owner with a passing interest in knowing how many miles to the gallon his pride and joy is getting.Were the decision of adding or not adding acetone to one's fuel tank merely a question of whether the practice boosted gasoline performance, that would be one thing, but unfortunately there are other issues to consider, such as the harm that the solvent can work on vehicles. Acetone is corrosive, which means it can eat away at rubber components such as gaskets and O-rings ‚Äî a particularly bad result for cars with rubber hoses in their fuel lines.Acetone will also eat the paint off of a car. As Tom of Car Talk noted in January 2006:Here's our final reason not to use [acetone]: It dissolves paint. So if you slip and spill a little bit outside your fuel filler door, you'll have a nice, unpainted line running down to the bottom edge of your rear quarter panel. When we see you drive by, we'll know you didn't take our advice!Additional information:SourcesAllen, Mike. ¬† ""Drive It Forever."" The Boston Globe. ¬† 17 September 2006 ¬† (p.

693	"A language handbook published by the anti-poverty charity Oxfam advises people to avoid use of the words ""mother"" and ""youth."""	"Viral memes displaying a portion of this guide cut out the context making it clear that ""mother"" and ""father"" can be used if that is the preference of the parents. This guide does not, as other memes claim, ban or abolish the use of these words. On March 13, 2023, the anti-poverty charity consortium Oxfam published an ""Inclusive Language Guide"" to its website. In describing its purpose, Oxfam wrote:At Oxfam it is important that the language we use reflects our values and work. Language has the power to reinforce or deconstruct systems of power that maintain poverty, inequality and suffering. Choices in language can empower us to reframe issues, rewrite tired stories, challenge problematic ideas and build a radically better future based on a survivor-centred, intersectional, anti-racist and feminist vision of equality.Aspects of this handbook went viral, particularly guidance around the use of the word ""mother"" and ""youth.""¬†It is true that the handbook suggests avoiding these words. It is also true that it calls English the ""language of a colonizing nation"" in its introduction:We ‚Ä¶ recognize that this guide has its origin in English, the language of a colonizing nation. We acknowledge the Anglo-supremacy of the sector as part of its coloniality. This guide aims to support people who have to work and communicate in the English language as part of this colonial legacy. However, we recognize that the dominance of English is one of the key issues that must be addressed in order to decolonise our ways of working and shift power.With respect to the words ""mother"" and ""father,"" the goal is to ""avoid assuming the adoption of gendered roles by transgender parents."" Such language, the guide clarifies, is fine if a parent's preference is known:¬†If trans parents have a preferred specified gender role, such as 'mother' or 'father', this should be respected. If unsure, it is more inclusive to use 'parent'.The hand book, as well, cautions against use of the words ""elderly, seniors, [and] youth."" As explained in the handbook, the terms ""people over/under X, elderly people, older people, [and] young people"" are preferred.¬†The goal, according to the guide, is to, ""Write about older people in a way that affords respect and dignity, and avoid phrases which are homogenizing or patronising. The same goes for writing about young people.""Some viral tweets have asserted that this guidance document bans or abolishes use of these words. This is not true. As Oxfam explained in a statement to the Telegraph, the guide is not meant to be prescriptive or enforce specific rules:This guide is primarily sector-focused, it is not prescriptive but helps authors communicate in a way that is respectful to the diverse range of people with whom we work. We are proud of using inclusive language; we won't succeed in tackling poverty by excluding marginalised groups.We are disappointed that some people have decided to misrepresent the advice offered in the guide by cropping the document to remove the clear statement that authors should respect the desire of individuals who want to be described as a mother or father."	true
2878	A fungus called Massospora cicadina could infect Brood X cicadas as they were set to emerge in May 2021. It's a ‚Äúdeath-zombie fungus‚Äù that could potentially wreak havoc on the species.	As billions of cicadas were expected to emerge across 15 states in spring 2021, online reports claimed that a ‚Äúdeath-zombie fungus‚Äù could infect the species and cause their body to rot away.The news first went viral when the IndyStar interviewed John Lill, a cicada expert and chair of biology.

6384	"During a 'Rolling Stone' interview, U2 singer Bono proclaimed that ""Donald Trump is destroying America, [and] we must stop him."""	"On 27 December 2017, Rolling Stone magazine published an interview with singer Bono, in which the U2 frontman discussed ""the state of his band, the state of the world and what he learned from almost dying"" along with subjects such as making streaming-friendly music, the refugee crisis in Europe, and how ""music has gotten very girly.""A few days later, the web site Neon Nettle published an unusual take on that interview, reporting (under the subhead ""Irish rocker of U2 colludes with elites remove president"") that Bono had proclaimed ""Donald Trump is destroying America, [and] we must stop him"": 
U2 frontman Bono has joined the long list of celebrities to bash Donald Trump in a painfully long Rolling Stone article this week when he highlighted Trump's criticism of the mainstream media in what he described as ""the bleakest era since Nixon.‚ÄùBono, who regularly rubs shoulders with elites like George Soros and Bill Clinton, claimed that fairness and equality were ""not improving"" under Trump.  The Irish rocker went on to say that the working class people of America's ""innocence died when they elected Donald Trump"" stating that a generation ""growing up think that human spirit towards fairness and justice"" was learning it might not be the case. ""Donald Trump is destroying America, we must stop him"" he added. ""He's destroying the America that I love, the country that allowed me to be involved in politics"".
The Neon Nettle report was ""unusual"" because it was completely fabricated: Bono said nothing during his Rolling Stone interview about ""colluding with elites"" to remove President Trump from office, nor did he state that he believed ""Donald Trump is destroying America.""  Bono was not specifically asked about, nor did he discuss, Trump at all during the course of his interview ‚Äî interviewer Jann Wenner posed some broad questions about politics, to which Bono offered some oblique replies that indirectly referenced President Trump (without ever mentioning him by name), such as the following:
This is surely the bleakest era since Nixon. It surely undermines the very idea of America, what is going on now. And Republicans know it, Democrats know it ‚Äì no one's coming off well here. We know some who should know better have tried to piggyback the man's celebrity to get stuff done. They will live to regret it. Before I went out against him in the primaries, I called a lot of Republican friends that I have and said, ""I can't in all conscience be quiet as this hostile takeover of your party and perhaps the country happens."" And I made the quote, and I still stand by it, ""America is the greatest idea the world has ever had, and this is potentially the worst idea that has ever happened to it.""When the [2016] election happened and people intuited that something awful and something unprecedented was happening, there was a sense of grief. We had Brexit, so people in Europe are feeling this as well. And I thought, ""This is melodrama."" Why are people, rational people I know, feeling like they are grieving like someone just died? It is an election, and it will correct itself, whatever.But then I realized that something had died. People's innocence had died. And a generation that had grown up thinking that the human spirit had a natural evolution toward fairness and justice was learning this might not be the case. My attitude was, ""OK, good. Now it is time we wake up and realize we can't take any of this for granted."" Big primates have been around a lot longer than democracy, and this dude who shall not be named ‚Äì he is just a new manifestation of that big primate. We got shook. Even in Europe, people have forgotten what fascism did to them. Whether it was fascism described as Stalin or Mao in the state communism, whatever you want to call it. It is forgotten.We are actually going back to the way we used to be. The new normal is the old normal. That is terrifying. The demonizing of ""the other"" has returned.
Neon Nettle also reported that ""Back in January this year U2 announced in an interview that they were going on strike to protest Trump, by canceling their upcoming album release and tour until the President-elect resigns. Looks like that didn't work out.""  All of this was also false: U2 didn't ""go on strike"" in 2017, they continued to tour throughout the year, and they delayed (but didn't cancel) the release of their Songs of Experience album in order to address some recent political events occurring as the album was in production."	false

1521	All Disney Store locations in the U.K. are closing, with the exception of at least one flagship location in London.	"In mid-June 2021, a rumor claimed that all Disney Store retail shops would be closing in the U.K., with the exception of a flagship location in London. Some versions of the rumor said that the stores would be gone by September.The prominent Disney Store that was said to likely remain was the Oxford Street location¬†in London, which is pictured above.The news was reported as a ""rumor"" by WDW News Today and other blogs.Previously, in May and early June, Inside the Magic, DisKingdom.com, and others also published stories that hinted at the likely impending closures.As of October, that news came true. Months after we first reported this story, we confirmed that the flagship Oxford Street Disney Store in London was the only one that remained in the U.K.We found multiple individual reports from 2021 that published news of Disney Stores closing in the U.K.On May 27, TheIndustry.fashion brought news that the Westfield Stratford location was not to reopen.

The company earned $444.7 million for the year ended Sept. 30. But the retail venture is expected to help promote Disney's other businesses - namely theme parks, television programs, and movies.In regard to the U.S., in March 2021, a Disney announcement said that the company planned to ""significantly reduce its brick-and-mortar footprint, beginning with the closure of at least 60 [Disney] stores in North America this year."""	true

1007	"Under the Biden administration, the IRS is hiring 87,000 new enforcement agents to ""come after"" and audit middle-class Americans."	"This claim misrepresents a 2021 U.S. Treasury Department report estimating that around $80 billion in funding would allow the IRS to incrementally hire nearly 87,000 employees by the year 2031. Most of those hires would be replacements for workers retiring from existing positions, including not only IRS enforcement agents, but also customer service and technology specialists. According to the Treasury Department, audit rates for those earning less than $400,000 in actual income will not rise.¬†On Jan. 9, 2023, House Republicans passed a bill that would rescind much of the money that the below-outlined legislation, a Democratic-led spending package, would provide the IRS, The Associated Press reported. The Democratic-controlled Senate, however, has vowed to ignore the January 2023 bill.After the U.S. Senate passed a sweeping spending budget in August 2022, Republicans began spreading outlandish claims about the roughly $80 billion of funding allocated to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). They said, for example, that the IRS would be hiring 87,000 new tax agents who would be ""coming for"" average Americans.¬†The IRS is not planning to hire 87,000 new tax agents for the purposes of targeting or ""coming for"" Americans who earn below a certain income. These exaggerated claims appeared to be aimed, at least in part, at capitalizing on partisan anger over the FBI raid on former U.S. President Donald Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago earlier in August. The raid was part of an investigation into whether Trump took classified records from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago residence, and had no apparent connection to taxes or the IRS.¬†Numerous conservatives tweeted a range of allegations surrounding the alleged hiring of 87,000 new IRS agents.¬†So, what is the $80 billion allotted to the IRS actually for? The Inflation Reduction Act would inject much needed funds into the federal tax agency, which has spent years chronically underfunded, according to The Washington Post, without the resources to process returns efficiently, or assess tax avoidance strategies. The agency's budget and staffing dropped considerably during that time. Around 50,000 staff members would be eligible for retirement in the next five years, according to Natasha Sarin, Treasury counselor for tax policy and implementation. She told The Washington Post that most of the funding will be focused on mitigating the effects of those losses by hiring more customer service and information technology specialists, as well as enforcement agents.¬†$45.6 billion of the funds would be aimed mostly at enforcement, with the remainder spent on upgrading technology and operations. Treasury officials say they do not know the exact number of enforcement agents that will be added to the staff.¬†So where did the 87,000 number come from? A Treasury Department May 2021 report estimated that the injection of new funds via the legislation would enable the IRS to incrementally hire around 86,852 new staff by 2031. But most of those hires would neither be for new positions nor for the roles of IRS enforcement agents. New staff would be added in increments of about 7,000 to 12,000 people.¬†The Treasury Department report analyzed how best for the administration to address the ""tax gap,"" which is the difference between what is owed to the government and what is actually collected. That figure is believed to be at least $381 billion a year due to underreporting of income. According to the report, enforcement would be focused on those with higher incomes:This involves spending nearly $80 billion on IRS priorities over the course of the decade including hiring new specialized enforcement staff, modernizing antiquated information technology, and investing in meaningful taxpayer service‚Äîincluding the implementation of the newly expanded credits aimed at providing support to American families. Importantly, the additional resources will go toward enforcement against those with the highest incomes, and audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for those earning less than $400,000 in actual income.¬†Moreover, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sent a letter to the IRS directing the agency to limit those audits to higher earners:Specifically, I direct that any additional resources‚Äîincluding any new personnel or auditors that are hired‚Äîshall not be used to increase the share of small business or households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited relative to historical levels. This means that, contrary to the misinformation from opponents of this legislation, small business or households earning $400,000 per year or less will not see an increase in the chances that they are audited."	false

Here's a comparison of the real image (left) and the fake photo (right):Although this image of the Oval Office being fumigated is fake, the White House will truly get a thorough cleaning before President Joe Biden takes residence.¬†CNN reported:A thorough cleaning is part of the every-four-years tradition that comes with the outgoing president and his family swapping White House living with the incoming president and family.The delicate and highly choreographed event of packing up and moving out, and unpacking and moving in, done by dozens of prepped and trained staff and movers, typically occurs in the six-hour window when both the exiting and entering presidents and their spouses attend Inauguration Day ceremonies on Capitol Hill. By the time the new president and first lady return to the White House, all of their stuff will have been moved in and ready to go -- down to a refrigerator stocked with their favorite foods and the master bathroom equipped with their preferred shampoo.But, like most things Trump administration, this January 20 won't be very traditional."	false
3461	Twitter banned the use of the hashtag #1984 in January 2021.	"On the evening of Jan. 8, 2021, Twitter announced it was permanently suspending U.S. President Donald Trump's account, saying that the president's messages could incite further violence in the days following the attack on the U.S. Capitol. While many welcomed Twitter's decision, some argued that the social media company was stepping into ""Orwellian"" territory, a reference to author George Orwell who is perhaps best known for the dystopian novel ""1984.""¬†Sean Davis, co-founder of right-wing magazine The Federalist, took to Twitter to claim that the social media network was ""banning references to Orwell"" and not allowing the use of hashtag #1984.Twitter is not deleting or banning references to Orwell, as evidenced by the fact that Davis' tweet, which references Orwell, is still available on Twitter as of this writing.¬†While it's true that #1984 can't be used as a hashtag, this has nothing to do with censorship, politics, Trump, or the Capitol riot. Twitter does not let users create hashtags solely from numbers. You can't make a hashtag for #1234, #2021, or any other string of numbers.¬†In a help section on its website, Twitter explains some of the reasons why ""My hashtags aren't working"":Is the hashtag made up entirely of numbers?If you write #1 or #123 the hashtag will not be hyperlinked and is therefore not searchable. However, if you include letters following the numbers in the hashtag, for example, #123go, then the hashtag will work correctly.As Twitter explains, those wanting to make an Orwell-related hashtag could use terms such as #1984Orwell or #Orwell1984.¬†It should also be noted that while Orwell's ""1984"" is often invoked by those who feel that they have been censored, the book's message runs far deeper than anti-censorship. Orwell was also concerned with the rise of totalitarian governments and their ability to use propaganda and censorship (the censors in ""1984"" worked for ""Big Brother"" in the government's ""Ministry of Truth"") to convince citizens of an alternate and ever-changing history.Whatever your interpretation of ""1984,"" it is a book worth reading and discussing (possibly with a functional hashtag like #1984Orwell)."	false

Nugent will use his massive influence in the world of music to put together a music festival that will ‚Äúrival Woodstock.‚Äù The hope is that the three-day festival will attract conservatives rather than liberals, who will do more than dance around drinking and drugging.

The article reported that:President Trump is facing consequences from yet another social media platform following last week's attack on the U.S. Capitol. YouTube said late Tuesday it had removed new content from Mr. Trump's channel and banned him from uploading any videos or livestreams for at least a week.

If the channel reoffends within three months, it will receive a second strike, and be banned from publishing new videos for two weeks. If a channel breaches YouTube policies three times within three months, it is typically permanently banned.Also on Jan. 7, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company had suspended Trump indefinitely, and for at least two weeks, finding that he had used the platform to ""condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters at the Capitol building,"" and that there was an intolerable risk Trump would use Facebook to ""incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government."""	true

Instead of something similar to the ad such as ""This Is Why Katy Perry Was Banned from 'SNL,'"" the headline was a broader story than originally teased: ""SNL Controversies Through the Years.""For well over 40 years, ""Saturday Night Live"" has been a staple of American television. The series has produced a roster of iconic stars and pop culture moments that are pretty much no other television show can replicate. However, ""SNL"" has also produced a large number of famous controversies that have led to public condemnations and firings.

5553	If voters are turned away from polls on election day, they can ask for a provisional ballot.	"Thousands of American citizens have been purged from voting registries or will face new obstacles to voting in several states, a situation which has drawn attention to a fail safe mechanism put in place by federal law to help ensure all eligible voters are counted: provisional ballots.In response to reports that states (including Indiana, Georgia, and North Dakota) had thrown up roadblocks to potential voters in the lead-up to the 6 November 2018 midterm elections, social media users sought to spread awareness to their fellow Americans about the back-up plan for those who believed themselves to be registered and eligible to vote but were turned away at the polls nevertheless: ""Give me a provisional ballot with a receipt as required by law when requested"":Memorize, take a screen shot, write in sharpie on your arm these magic words to use IF YOU ARE TURNED AWAY AT THE POLLS: https://t.co/FsQq5Icfol‚Äî Carrie L. Kruck (@KruckCarrie) October 12, 2018In most states, provisional ballots are for voters who believe they are registered but their registration can't be found. States that have same-day voter registration (SDR) have little need for them while states that have voter identification laws such as Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Virginia use them for those who go to the polls but don't have the proper ID on hand. In those cases the voter has a certain amount of time to present a local election official with the required identification in order for the provisional ballot to be counted.Most states don't have same-day registration, and federal law requires election officials provide voters who do not appear on registries or whose eligibility has been challenged by officials at the polls to be given provisional ballots, according to Section 302 of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). ""The deal with the provisional ballots is that so long as you believe yourself to be registered, you have the right to a provisional ballot. Polling workers are supposed to offer this to you,"" said Allegra Chapman, senior counsel and director of voting and elections for the government accountability organization Common Cause.If voters must use provisional ballots, Chapman added that they absolutely should request receipts if they aren't automatically offered. The provisional ballot receipts provide voters the necessary information to follow up and find out if their votes were counted. Common Cause officials urge voters who encounter any problems on election day to call 866-OUR-VOTE to speak to trained volunteers or text the words ""election protection"" to 97779 for voting assistance.In SDR states like Wisconsin, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Iowa and Idaho, voters can register on the spot.¬†Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming and Washington, D.C. also have same-day voter registration. North Dakota doesn't have voter registration but it does have voter identification laws.""Wisconsin voters who are not on the poll list can register on election day. In Wisconsin, provisional ballots are used primarily for voters who do not have an acceptable photo identification,"" said Reid Magney, public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Voters in Wisconsin have until 4 p.m. the Friday after the election to present their local election official with required identification in order for their vote to be counted.North Dakota voters without required identification who cast provisional ballots must present an acceptable form of identification to local election officials within six days in order for their votes to be counted. Sen. Heidi Hietkamp also introduced a bill that would, among other things, enable voting precincts to treat the state's large minority Native American residents' tribal ID cards like state and local-issued forms of identification for purposes of voting.Provisional ballot voting has gotten wide attention because of highly-publicized cases in which state officials have either purged voter roles and/or enacted legislation that critics fear will disenfranchise minority communities.In Georgia, a 2017 ""exact match"" law allowed the registration of voters to be suspended and then cancelled if the information on their government-issued identification varied even slightly from the information on their voter registration forms. According to court documents, ""Under this 'exact match' protocol, the transposition of a single letter or number, deletion or addition of a hyphen or apostrophe, the accidental entry of an extra character or space, and the use of a familiar name like ‚ÄúTom‚Äù instead of 'Thomas' will cause a no match result."" And the burden of rectifying the issue falls on voters.Georgia secretary of state and gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp is currently being sued by a coalition of civil rights groups who claim the ""exact match"" law has hampered the registration of 51,111 voters, 80.15% of whom are black, Latino, or Asian, and some critics have called on Kemp to resign.Also in 2017, Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson dropped roughly half a million entries from voter registries in what she called an effort to clean up an outdated list. In June 2018, a federal court blocked the state from implementing a 2017 law that would have allowed election officials to cancel registrations without notice if voters' names appeared on an interstate database meant to flag potential double voting.The database, Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck, has been criticized as being unreliable, while the court ruled the Indiana law violated federal law. Indiana officials have been accused of violating that court order and did not respond to our questions about it.In North Dakota, the U.S. Supreme Court on 9 October 2018 let stand a state law requiring voters to present identification listing their residential addresses. Because many among the state's large Native American minority use post office (P.O.) boxes and not street addresses on reservations, the Supreme Court decision that allowing the voter ID requirements to remain in place through the November 2018 election has caused many to fear that tribal members will be collectively disenfranchised on election day."	true

Scientists are still uncertain whether a person who has contracted the COVID-19 coronavirus disease can catch it again. However, according to an item circulated via social media (""Corona is so bad, this guy died twice!""), one person has apparently not only caught, but actually died of COVID-19 twice:According to the two separate news accounts pictured above, a retired Milwaukee police lieutenant and a University of Memphis professor, identified with identical photographs, seemingly both died in March 2020 from the COVID-19 coronavirus.However, the news reports of the COVID-19 victim seen above employed different headlines to refer to the same person, Lenard Wells, who was both a former police officer and an instructor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Memphis:[Wells] spent 27 years on the Milwaukee Police Department, where he worked tirelessly to bring racial equity to the ranks as president of the League of Martin, an association for African American officers.During his tenure, the League of Martin sued to make sure promotions and assignments were fair.""He wanted African American law enforcement officers to have the same rights and opportunities that were afforded to other officers,"" Assistant Milwaukee Police Chief Regina Howard said.After his police retirement, then-Gov.

3748	NFL star Tom Brady's company received a nearly $1 million loan from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) during the COVID-19 pandemic.	In early December 2020, after months of litigation brought by news organizations, the Trump administration finally made public data about recipients of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a bailout program rolled out in the spring that was meant to help small businesses survive economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.In all, 5.2 million businesses, including Snopes, were able to access forgivable PPP loans. But the release of the data showing what businesses received a portion of the more than $500 billion in taxpayer relief money was accompanied by scrutiny and controversy.In one controversy, the data released by the Small Business Administration showed sports performance and nutrition company TB12, which is owned by former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, received nearly $1 million.According to the data released by the Small Business Association, TB12, a sports health company, received $960,855 in PPP loans in April 2020. The company did not state whether any jobs were saved on account of receiving the loan. On its LinkedIn Page, TB12 stated it has between 11 and 50 employees.Some on social media criticized the loan, citing Brady's own personal wealth. In March 2020, Brady signed a $50 million, two-year contract to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.The data release also revealed that more than half the money went to larger businesses, including national chains. Another analysis found that more than $3.65 million went to businesses that were tenants in properties owned by U.S. President Donald Trump and his adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.	true
1259	Storing batteries in a refrigerator or freezer will improve their performance.	My sister‚Äôs refrigerator was its own peculiar chill closet of mystery, in that other than the odd opened tin of cat food and a quart of skim milk, it generally contained little other than batteries, bottles of nail polish, and unopened packages of pantyhose.The cat food and the skim milk both I (and her cat) understood. But what to make of the other three items?When questioned, she replied keeping batteries in the refrigerator helped them not lose their charge nearly as rapidly, thereby making them last longer. Refrigerating nail polish, she said, kept it from getting ‚Äúclumpy.‚Äù As for the pantyhose (and here she looked at me like I was a complete fool for not knowing this), refrigerating brand new pairs made the stockings far less likely to develop runs when they were worn. (It‚Äôs left to the reader to imagine her response to my reply that sliding into a freshly-chilled pair of pantyhose must certainly add excitement to her morning.)As to what to make of all this icebox wisdom, let‚Äôs start with the notion that chilling one‚Äôs batteries will make them last longer. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a good idea to store batteries in a refrigerator. It does not prolong their life, and the condensation when you take the batteries out can actually damage them.Says Duracell about this belief:QuestionShould I store my batteries in the refrigerator or freezer?¬†AnswerWe recommend storing batteries at room temperature in a dry environment. Extreme heat or cold reduces battery performance. You‚Äôll want to avoid putting battery-powered devices in very warm places. In addition, refrigeration is not necessary or recommended.As does¬†Energizer:No, storage in a refrigerator or freezer is not required or recommended for batteries produced today. Cold temperature storage can in fact harm batteries if condensation results in corroded contacts or label or seal damage due to extreme temperature storage. To maximize performance and shelf life, store batteries at normal room temperatures (68¬∞F to 78¬∞F or 20¬∞C to 25¬∞C) with moderated humidity levels (35 to 65% RH).Many nail polish aficionados swear that keeping their fingernail paint in the refrigerator renders the liquid a little thinner and easier to use, and indeed advice to refrigerate one‚Äôs bottles of nail polish has been repeated in numerous newspaper ‚Äúhousehold hints‚Äù columns. However, some who have tried this tip assert the polish is afterwards thicker and harder to apply, so the jury is still out on this one.There is clear-cut agreement on the topic of keeping bottles of nail polish tightly capped when not in use. Air is the enemy of nail polish, rendering the liquid thicker and more difficult to apply. Therefore, to extend the life of one‚Äôs polish, even when waiting for one coat to dry before putting on another, recap the bottle tightly.Those who swear by the ‚Äúrefrigerate pantyhose to toughen them‚Äù practice say it makes the fibers in these articles of clothing resistant to forming runs, and indeed some have said¬†pre-chilled¬†hose will last twice as long. (Then again, there have been those who recommend soaking pantyhose in a solution of salt water for several hours to make the fibers stronger.)[Ann Landers, January 1983]Print this for ‚ÄúLadder Legs,‚Äù who complained about pantyhose that rip after two wearings. I found a solution in a column by Heloise, who gives some very practical household hints.Put the package of pantyhose, unopened, into the freezing compartment of the refrigerator. Leave it there for¬†24 hours.¬†Take out, let thaw and rinse the pantyhose in cold water. Freezing strengthens the nylons against runs and pulls. I tried it and have been wearing two pair of pantyhose ($3.95 each) alternately for nine months. The same brand used to last three weeks per pair.Here's another example of the claim:[People, May 1979]One of your [Mary Ellen Pinkham‚Äôs, writer of a household tips book] unexpected recommendations is to put pantyhose in the freezer. Why?¬†They last longer if when they are new you wet them thoroughly, wring out gently, place in a plastic bag and toss in the freezer. Once frozen, you thaw them out in the bathtub and then hang them up to dry. Don‚Äôt ask me why or what the chemical reaction is. All I know is that it works.Before everyone starts chucking their pantyhose in on top of the frozen fish sticks, it needs be pointed out this advice about using extreme cold to toughen fibers comes from decades ago. Hosiery, like so much else, has advanced with the times. Even if this did work for the pantyhose of¬†30 years¬†ago, it might not have any effect now.As to what the experts actually do recommend, the Hosiery Association provides this¬†advice¬†on preventing runs:Make sure your skin and nails are smooth (hands, feet and legs). Remove jewelry that can snag the hosiery. Gather the leg within your hands and slowly run them up you leg. Once the hose are on, lightly wet your hands, start at your ankle and gently guide your hose up to the position you find the most suitable for you.	false
3874	A 71-year-old Florida man was arrested on suspicion of grand theft after tying a downed power pole to the roof of his vehicle.	"A 71-year-old Florida man was arrested on suspicion of grand theft after finding a downed power pole near an interstate and tying it to the roof of his 1997 Toyota Camry, with the hope of selling the pole for scrap metal.The story went viral after it was first reported by The Associated Press on Nov. 17 and appeared in a number of news outlets around the U.S. in the days that followed.Snopes readers asked our team to look into his alleged arrest record, which we found listed on the Hillsborough Sheriff's Office website. Douglas Hatley was arrested on Nov. 16 and was in jail at the time of publication with a bond set at $4,000, facing grand theft charges ‚Äî a charge administered if the property stolen is more than $300 but less than $20,000, and punishable by a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.Sgt. Steve Gaskins, spokesman with the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP), sent Snopes the following statement:On November 16, 2020, FHP Troopers responded to the report of a theft that occurred on westbound Interstate 4, near Milepost 9, in which a motorist had loaded a downed power pole onto a small sedan.Just before 11:00 AM, Troopers located the motorist at North 50th Street, near State Road 60, and arrested Douglas Allen Hatley, 71, of Lakeland, Florida. The utility pole and Hatley‚Äôs 1997 Toyota were recovered at that time. Hatley was charged with grand theft and delivered to the Hillsborough County Jail.An employee of the construction group Walsh Infrastructure followed the maroon Toyota Camry after he witnessed the driver of the vehicle load a light pole located on the outside shoulder of Interstate 4 onto his car. The employee also called authorities.FHP Trooper William Hale wrote in his report that he ""observed a light pole attached to the roof of the car with what seemed to be telephone wire,"" noting that he then stopped the vehicle and talked to the driver.‚ÄúWhile speaking to Hatley, he explained that he did, in fact, find the downed light pole on the side of the interstate and was attempting to turn it in as scrap metal for money. He advised [that] he was unaware that it was illegal to remove utility poles or light poles from the interstate if they were in fact broken or fallen over.‚ÄùHatley was then arrested and booked into the Hillsborough County Jail."	true
3786	In 2020, Donald Trump became the first U.S. president to mark World AIDS Day by hanging a red ribbon outside the White House.	"In December 2020, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany claimed that U.S. President Donald Trump had broken new ground in honoring World AIDS Day by becoming the first president to erect a large red ribbon, a symbol of solidarity and support for people with HIV and AIDS, outside the White House.During a briefing on Dec. 2, Washington Blade reporter Chris Johnson highlighted the fact that Trump's proclamation marking the day on Dec. 1 included no mention of the LGBTQ community, despite the disproportionate impact of HIV and AIDS on those communities. In response, McEnany sidestepped the question, but defended Trump, claiming:""The president honored World AIDS Day yesterday in a way that no president has before, with the red ribbon there, and I think that he commemorated the day as he should have.""The exchange can be viewed in full below:McEnany's claim was demonstrably false.¬†The Trump administration did erect a red ribbon outside the White House for World AIDS Day in 2020, so that part is at least true. And he did the same in 2017, 2018 and 2019, but he was far from the first president to do so.¬†President George W. Bush began the tradition of hanging the symbolic ribbon outside the north portico of the White House on World Aids Day 2007: A giant red ribbon hangs 30 November 2007 from the North Portico of the White House for the next two days to represent the continued battle against HIV/AIDS ahead of World AIDS Day in Washington, DC. (TIM SLOAN/AFP via Getty Images)Bush did so again in 2008.¬†President Barack Obama's two administrations kept up the tradition, marking World AIDS Day with a red ribbon in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.¬†So while McEnany claimed Trump, in hanging a red ribbon outside the White House, had marked World AIDS Day ""in a way that no president has before,"" in reality the two previous presidents had done exactly that over 10 consecutive years.¬†Johnson was right to say that Trump had consistently failed to mention the LGBTQ community in his proclamations marking World AIDS Day ‚Äî in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. As Johnson highlighted, Trump's message in 2020 made a point of noting that ""it is all too clear that this deadly disease disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities,"" but notably did not mention the LGBTQ community.¬†"	false
2756	"Heath Ledger improvised in the hospital scene in ""The Dark Knight"" after something went wrong with the explosions."	"On July 27, 2021, a new TikTok video was posted that claimed actor Heath Ledger ""completely improvised"" the hospital explosion scene in the role of the Joker for the 2008 Batman film, ""The Dark Knight.""The video was viewed more than 30 million times in less than one month. It was published by @learnwithsteve: This was false. Ledger did not ""completely improvise"" during the hospital scene, nor was there a ""little mishap on the set"" that caused the timing of explosions to malfunction. While it's true that Ledger likely brought a bit of his own flair to the scene, it was not ""completely improvised"" after a problem occurred. Screen Rant previously debunked this claim in January 2020, as did Showbiz Cheat Sheet in June 2021.Another video with millions of views also made false claims about Ledger purportedly improvising during the scene. In the YouTube description, the user wrote: ""The explosion really failed but they didn't afford to stop shooting so Heath just did what he does best."" This was not true.In reality, director Christopher Nolan said that the film's crew took great care to ensure that every moment of the hospital explosion scene was ""rehearsed endlessly."" This was the opposite of the idea that Ledger, then a major movie star, improvised during the dangerous scene.In a behind-the-scenes video also mentioned in Showbiz Cheat Sheet's reporting, Nolan walked through the entire creation of the scene.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUFiNuRAmmc&t=28sNolan, who also co-wrote the script and served as the film's producer, said that special effects supervisor Chris Corbould added ""a little beat where the first set of explosions stops"":Chris [Corbould] and his guys, working very closely with the demolition team, they were able to come up with a scenario in which Heath [Ledger] could actually be walking out of the building. Because what Chris worked out is if we put in a little beat where the first set of explosions stops, as if something has gone wrong, and the Joker just takes a second to look around, surprised, like the audience is surprised, then the major demolition comes in, and he jumps straight in the school bus.In that way, he was able to come up with a practical scenario in which we could actually take a principal actor, walk him out of a building that's about to be destroyed, and literally drop a building to the ground.In other words, the pause between explosions was planned.Nolan noted that the cast and crew carefully rehearsed the scene around 12 times, as they only had one shot at getting it right:We rehearsed endlessly with Heath that morning. We walked him out, going through exactly what he was going to do. Chris Corbould calling the explosions where they would take place. We rehearsed it, I think, about 12 times, I think, we literally walked him out, videotaped the rehearsal, and looked at it from different camera angles.Heath was such a perfectionist to be so precise in what he was doing, which was essential because this was obviously a one-take thing, and the angle I knew that we really needed, despite all of the other cameras we set, we really needed that close shot on him walking out to work perfectly.He did it very, very precisely. I don't know how he resisted looking back, you know, all of the explosions and lightweight material that the special effects guys were blowing behind him. I think he winded up with bits in his hair at the end of it, so close he was to everything that was going off.Nolan also mentioned that multiple camera angles didn't make it into the final cut, all because he felt it was important to ""show the fact that we had done it for real and that Heath had done it for real.""When the scene came together for the movie, only two exterior shots of the hospital explosion made it in the film, at the 0:06 and 0:55 marks in this clip:Ledger died in 2008 before ""The Dark Knight"" was released. In 2009, he won a posthumous Oscar for his acting, which members of his family accepted for him."	false

2216	A narrow waterway in England called the Bolton Strid is unusually dangerous and has been the site of numerous drownings.	"The Bolton Strid is a segment of the River Wharfe in England where the waterway drastically narrows and deepens, creating deadly currents that have claimed several lives over the centuries. However, a viral meme about the strid features a photograph of a calmer section of the River Wharfe, not the specific stretch of river known as the Strid. 
A photograph supposedly showing the Bolton Strid, a surprisingly dangerous stream¬† that ""swallows people whole,"" is often circulated on social media:This meme reads: ""Many people have died attempting to cross a seemingly calm creek called the Bolton Strid. The stream actually hosts multiple underwater cave systems and dangerous currents below the surface that have sucked numerous people to their deaths.""The contents of this meme are generally accurate. The above-displayed photograph, however, was taken by Flickr user Andy Hawkins in 2010 and shows the Bolton Abbey on the River Wharfe in England. The Bolton Strid is a specific section of this river that is much more narrow than the waterway showed in this picture. Here's a picture of the Strid from the Library of Congress:The narrowness of the Bolton Strid, in fact, is one of the factors that makes it so dangerous. The River Wharfe is a shallow but wide river, except for where it runs through the Strid. The river essentially flips on its side, creating dangerous currents that run through a series of underwater tunnels.¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCSUmwP02T8
¬†
In a 2016 article dubbing the Strid ""England's Killer Creek,"" the New York Times wrote:The Strid is a segment of the River Wharfe, which runs past the tranquil ruins of Bolton Priory, an ancient monastery. A few yards upstream from the Strid, the river is shallow and wide, about 30 feet from bank to bank. But then the terrain squeezes the river so tightly that it is effectively turned on its side. Instead of wide and shallow, it becomes narrow and deep, a powerful wedge of water racing through a crevasse riddled with underwater caves and overhangs. This is the Bolton Strid.The exact depth of the Strid is unknown. Most articles about it note that the river flips on its side, going from about 30 feet wide and a few feet deep, to 30 feet deep and a few feet wide. In 2021, YouTuber Jack a Snacks attempted to measure the depth of the Strid, and concluded that at its deepest parts, it was more than 200 feet deep:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFQXT6PIP8
¬†
The Strid is often referred to as the ""most dangerous stretch of water in the world."" While this is a bit of a subjective statement, we can say that this stretch of water has truly claimed the lives of several people over the centuries. In 1998, for example, a honeymooning couple drowned after accidentally they went for a walk near the river and fell into the Strid. More than a century earlier in 1877, a man picnicking with friends and family drowned after he tried to jump across the Strid: 14 Aug 1877, Tue The Leeds Mercury (Leeds, West Yorkshire, England) Newspapers.comPoet William Wordsworth wrote about another young man who attempted to jump across the Strid in the 12th century. In Wordsorth's poem ""The Force of Prayer; or, The Founding of Bolton Prior,"" he writes about a boy named William de Romilly of Egremont who drowned after attempting to jump over the Strid. Here's an excerpt from the poem:Young Romilly through Barden woods
Is ranging high and low;
And holds a greyhound in a leash,
To let slip upon buck or doe.The pair have reached that fearful chasm,
How tempting to bestride!
For lordly Wharf is there pent in
With rocks on either side.This striding-place is called THE STRID,
A name which it took of yore:
A thousand years hath it borne that name,
And shall a thousand more.And hither is young Romilly come,
And what may now forbid
That he, perhaps for the hundredth time,
Shall bound across THE STRID?He sprang in glee,--for what cared he
That the river was strong, and the rocks were steep?--
But the greyhound in the leash hung back,
And checked him in his leap."	true

5673	Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign has sent fundraising letters with an envelope made up to resemble a legal summons.	"Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was criticized in September 2018 after a Twitter user posted a photograph of a fundraising mailer that he claimed was intended to deceive voters.


The tweet included a photograph of the mailer, which was labled as an ""official summons"" from the recipient's county and sent by a ""Voter Enrollment Campaign Division."" Instead of a city of origin, however, the third line of the letter stated that it emanated from ""Ted Cruz for Senate 2018"":

The Twitter user, Sean Owen, told news outlets that he felt the mailer went ""over the line"" in resembling a legal document. ""It made me mad because my grandmother suffered from some dementia, and could easily have followed the urgent request inside to send money,"" he said.
A Texas state lawmaker, Democratic Rep. Gene Wu, also criticized the mailers, saying on his own Twitter account that they could violate a provision of state law banning ""simulating legal process"":

The fake ""summonses"" did indeed originate with Cruz's campaign, but a spokesperson for the Federal Election Commission (FEC) said that because the mailers contain a disclaimer stating that they originate with a campaign, they do not violate federal election law:
Ted Cruz‚Äôs Senate re-election campaign has been sending voters in Texas a fund-raising letter in an envelope labeled ‚Äúsummons enclosed,‚Äù drawing criticism from some who called it misleading and raising questions about whether such a practice was legal. It is.
That is according to Myles Martin, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, who said the salient question was whether a mailing contains a disclaimer saying that it came from a political campaign. And this one did.
Aside from that, he said in an email, ‚Äúthe F.E.C.‚Äôs regulations don‚Äôt speak to how candidates may choose to word particular solicitations to potential contributors.‚Äù
The senator's re-election campaign confirmed in May 2018 that they sent 50,000 such mailers in San Antonio but said that only one recipient complained to ""local media.""
That statement was a reference to an editorial published in the San Antonio Express-News urging Cruz, who is running for re-election against Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke, to ""rethink"" the use of the mailer.
""It's understandable [Cruz] would want to summon conservative support,"" the editorial stated. ""But certainly his campaign can do that without making it look like a legal threat, right?""
Cruz's campaign responded by saying, ""Our mail efforts have been both effective and critical to identifying and engaging our supporters, and getting them involved in our campaign efforts to keep Texas strong.""

2342	Wikileaks released footage showing that the moon landing was faked.	"An old video supposedly showing leaked footage from Wikileaks about the 1969 moon landing being ""faked"" was recirculated on social media in December 2021:¬†https://www.bitchute.com/video/HBagDQeyW9uB/
¬†
Various versions of this video have been shared on social media since at least 2019. While many of these iterations are only about two minutes long, some longer edits of this hoax video (such as the clip above from Rumble) have also spread online.¬†This video does not show NASA astronauts pretending to be on the moon while filming a fake moon landing in the Nevada desert. The majority of the clips in this video were actually taken from a behind-the-scenes look at the 1970s movie ""Capricorn One."" For example, one of the opening clips in this hoax video (at roughly 20 seconds when a person looks at a camera) can be seen around the 2:00 minute mark of the following video from the making of this satirical film.¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb2J90A4PKo
¬†
Another way to tell that this rumor is false is by checking Wikileaks. While this organization has published classified materials in the past, it has not released any footage indicating that the moon landing was fake. We were unable to find this ""fake moon landing"" video on Wikileaks' website or social media feeds.¬†Conspiracy theories concerning the moon landing have been circulating practically since Apollo 11 touched down on the surface of the moon in July 1969. But it wasn't until the release of ""Capricorn One"" in 1978, according to astronomer Phil Plait, that this conspiracy theory moved into the mainstream.¬†Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the lunar surface on July 20, 1969. Even back then, some people were skeptical that the feat was technologically possible. The James Bond movie ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" for example, had a joke about faked moon landings just two years later, in 1971.But what really propelled the conspiracy theory into popular culture, Plait said, was the 1978 Peter Hyams film ""Capricorn One,"" which portrays a faked human landing on Mars. (Also, a 1976 self-published pamphlet by Bill Kaysing, ""We Never Went to the Moon,"" was popular among conspiracy-minded people of the day.)That was 40 years ago, but moon-hoax enthusiasts are still with us today.Here's a trailer for the satirical film:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKbwdTCL8rA
¬†
We've looked into several of these rumors in the past and found that many of them are based on various pieces of media being removed from their original context and then shared with false claims. This photograph, for example, truly shows three people wearing astronaut suits but no helmets. While this photograph was shared on social media as if it was ""proof"" that the moon landing was filmed on a movie stage, not the moon, the picture was actually taken during an earth-bound training mission three years after the 1969 moon landing. You can see more moon hoaxes here.¬†"	false

All were¬†expected to air reruns in lieu of new content.¬†Around¬†9,000 writers ‚Äî 98%¬†of the WGA's voting body ‚Äî stopped doing their jobs at 12:01 a.m. on May 2¬†after the guild and Hollywood studios failed to successfully negotiate a new three-year contract governing writers' working conditions and benefits. This was the first such strike in 15 years.¬†News outlets such as Deadline and The Associated Press¬†confirmed¬†the nightly¬†shows would¬†stop operations and air reruns throughout the week. Considering this evidence, we rated this claim ""True.""¬†It was unknown, as of this writing, whether weekly shows like ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Real Time with Bill Maher"", and ""Last Week Tonight with John Oliver"" would also halt live production. If studios and the writers guild reach a deal¬†this week, it was¬†possible the weekly shows could air new programming without a hiatus.¬†Such comedy talk shows were¬†the first to be affected by the strike because they rely on writers' daily work, with jokes often being written the same day they air. The next group of shows that could be impacted were¬†daytime soap operas that have a quick turnaround between writing and filming. Scripted dramas and comedies currently airing will likely¬†finish their seasons without change since their episodes were previously written and filmed, while fall releases were¬†expected to be hit with delays since¬†writers usually begin writing them¬†in May or June, according to Reuters. ¬†Writers were¬†demanding¬†the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents big-name studios including Disney and Netflix, increase their pay and give them a greater share of profits from streaming services. In their negotiations for a new contract, the writers called attention to their lack of compensation for shows that remain on streaming platforms for years, and the possible effects of artificial intelligence on screenwriting. Writers also criticized studios for creating a ""gig economy"" that prioritized freelance work over steady, full-time jobs.¬†Colbert, Fallon, Kimmel and Meyers all openly agreed to pause live production on their shows until further notice.Before officially halting operations,¬†Meyers, the host of ""Late Night with Seth Meyers,"" said on his show that he supported the writers' demands. ""[...] No one is entitled to a job in show business. But for those people who have a job, they are entitled to fair compensation. They are entitled to make a living. I think it's a very reasonable demand that's being set out by the guild. And I support those demands.""¬†Prior to making the decision to go dark, Fallon also told Variety, ""I wouldn't have a show if it wasn't for my writers, and I support them all the way.""On May 1, before the strike started, Colbert devoted a segment of his show to jokes that could be relevant in the future, pending the potential shutdown. The segment was titled, ""Future News Jokes Now‚Ä¶Just In Case.""¬†Deadline reported late-night showrunners were in communication with each other on next steps. An unnamed showrunner reportedly told the outlet, ""I have been and will continue to talk to the other shows to see what they're up to. We've got to support the writers ‚Äî our writers are amazing. That said, the rest of the staff is amazing, and I don't want to see anybody lose their jobs or lose a paycheck. What's the happy medium there? Figuring that out, it's not been easy."""	true
4202	The common allergy drug Benadryl can be used to treat rattlesnake bites.	A Facebook post shared in July 2019 claimed that the over-the-counter allergy drug Benadryl could be used to treat a rattlesnake bite. Since its original posting, the status has received more than 12,000 shares:Benadryl might save a life: For anyone in Rattlesnake country: I have learned something new that I thought was important enough that I wanted to pass on. A man was bitten by a rattlesnake a few days ago. He was getting ready to bale and turned over a windrow to check the moisture and the snake was in it.It wrapped around his arm and bit him on the underside of the wrist. Luckily it was not a severe bite, the fang marks were clear, but not deep enough to draw blood.He came straight to the house and we got ice on it and had him to the hospital within an hour.I called ahead so the emergency room was ready for him.By the time he got there his arm was starting to swell to the shoulder and his throat was getting tight.The first thing the emergency room did was give him Benadryl.Apparently antivenom must be received within 4 hours of the snakebite, but the immediate threat is swelling and death of tissue, which was treated with the Benadryl.But there is no truth to this claim, according to an international group of doctors, paramedics, and scientists collectively known as the Snakebite Foundation.‚ÄúBenadryl is not effective for snake envenomations in humans or other animals. Please stop sharing this information. Antivenom along with proper supportive care are the only effective treatments supported by peer-reviewed literature,‚Äù wrote Snakebite Foundation member Dr. Nick Brandehoff, an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at the University of California, San Francisco at Fresno, in a blog post.Rattlesnake venom is made up of a variety of peptides and proteins described in the scientific journal Chemical Ecology as a ‚Äúmultifunctional cocktail‚Äù that, once injected into the bloodstream, can cause harmful neurotoxic and inflammatory issues. In particular, rattlesnake venom contains two neurotoxins that can lead to pain, paralysis, tissue necrosis, and in extreme cases death.To treat bites from pit vipers and other venomous snakes, the World Health Organization strictly advises the use of antivenoms, which work by boosting a patient‚Äôs immune response. Antivenoms are produced by harvesting snake venom and then using it to immunize donor animals such as horses and sheep. Antibodies from these animals are then harvested and purified from plasma that can ‚Äúliterally make a difference between life and death.‚ÄùAn allergy, on the other hand, is an immune response to allergens that releases chemicals known as histamines. These are treated with antihistamines like Benadryl, more commonly known as diphenhydramine, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. In some cases, American Family Physician notes that antihistamines may be used to treat anaphylaxis, which the Journal of Wilderness Medicine reports has been known to result from a rattlesnake bite, in conjunction with epinephrine.‚ÄúComparing bee venom and snake venom to assume Benadryl will work is not congruent. Bee venom specially targets cells causing [the] release of histamine which results in swelling, pain, redness, and allergic reactions. This is similar to the pathway for non-venom induced allergic reactions,‚Äù wrote Brandehoff, highlighting that snake venom works ‚Äúvia different mechanisms.‚Äù	false

427	"Twitter owner Elon Musk created a line of CBD gummies that can ""reverse dementia,"" a move that sparked a lawsuit with Fox News."	"In April 2023, a rumor began to spread that claimed Twitter owner Elon Musk had revealed a new line of CBD gummies that could ""reverse dementia."" According to the story, Musk's gummy product sparked a ""huge lawsuit"" with Fox News.However, none of this was true.Musk was simply the latest famous person to have his image and likeness used by scammers without permission in an attempt to push miracle promises about CBD or keto gummies. He has nothing to do with any of these products.While the answer here is a fairly simple ""it's all fake,"" the massive reach of these gummy scams might surprise some readers.As of May 18, the scam was still making the rounds in at least one paid ad on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. The ad on a Facebook page named Aromathy read, ""Media Backlash Over New Musk Business Announcement. Elon Has a Response. His New Business Venture Has Been Under Scrutiny By Media.""The ad led to a fake article on¬†aromasense.shop that was designed to fool readers into believing they were reading from the Fox News website.Many of the Facebook users who commented on the ad believed that the post was a real news announcement. For example, one person commented, ""MEDIA IS AGAINST ANYTHING THAT IS GOOD!! IGNORE THEM!"" Some users also appeared to think that Musk made the post himself, with one person writing, ""Don't pay attention to the media! So many are fake and bias! Be true to yourself! I trust you.""In other words, Fox News and Elon Musk may have been included together by scammers to target easily influenced users who have conservative political leanings and a distrust of mainstream news media.To create the fake Fox News article, scammers copied the logo and article layout from foxnews.com and replicated it on the aromasense.shop website. Scammers have been doing this design-replication process with the logos and designs of multiple publishers for years.The article began with the headline, ""Elon Musk reverses dementia, solution sparks huge lawsuit pressure on Fox, he finally fights back on air.""The body of the fictional story was a template that scammers had used many times before about various TV personalities who had their own shows. However, in this case, the article didn't really make sense to be used with Musk since he didn't have a show.The fake article began as follows:(Fox) - In an Exclusive Interview, Elon Musk, a business magnate and investor, CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, Inc. and Twitter, Inc. reveals that the show will be ending after his latest business sparks tension with Martha MacCallum.During a heated episode last week, Elon Musk made headlines after revealing his new CBD line on Live TV. Martha MacCallum was outraged saying she will be filing a lawsuit against Elon Musk and Fox for violating his contract and 'scaring-off' sponsors. Elon Musk responded with this:""I know Martha is just coming after my timeslot. I am not giving in to 'Cancel Culture'. When I started this whole thing back in 2018, it really was just a part time passion project and a way for me to give back. After being given so much, I figured there was no better time to make Impact Garden CBD Gummies available to everyone, as it can help thousands of people experience life pain-free and live much happier lives.""His product, Impact Garden CBD Gummies, has been flying off the shelves within minutes and Elon Musk says his number one struggle as CEO is being able to keep up with demand. His CBD wellness line is 90% cheaper and five times more effective than those being offered by Bayer and other ""Big Pharma"" companies.Marthan MacCallum was furious after seeing multiple sponsors sue Fox News Network. Martha is now calling for Elon Musk to be indicted, saying: ""I am happy Elon Musk found something to replace prescriptions, but his announcement was a direct breach of contract. Fox News should sue him immediately and he should formally apologize.""...Elon Musk eventually admitted that although Martha MacCallum is enraged, other Fox hosts has been supportive of him. Tucker Carlson even went on Live TV to say that:¬†""Impact Garden CBD Gummies¬†has completely changed my life and it's clear that MacCallum is attempting a Coup.""Again, this article was fictional. The story about Musk, CBD gummies that can ""reverse dementia,"" Fox News, Martha MacCallum, and Tucker Carlson all never happened. (Vitality Labs CBD Gummies, Organicore CBD Gummies, and other product names were also mentioned.)For more information on CBD and keto gummies scams, we recommend a recent story about Ree Drummond, another celebrity whose image and likeness were also used by scammers to push these products.If any readers were scammed and ordered any gummy products after being led to believe that Musk or other celebrities endorsed them, we recommend filing a report with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).We also advise readers to call their credit card company to dispute the charges. It may be a good idea to block future charges from the sellers in question or to get a new card number altogether, as many of these scams sign customers up to be charged subscription fees of hundreds of dollars per month.Bear in mind that, while it is rare, scammers sometimes use the exact name or a similar name of a real CBD company without permission to push these sorts of scams. In those minority of cases, there's no evidence that the company had any involvement in the activity.We've received word from users in recent months who said that they were being charged for these sorts of gummy products despite having no recollection of ordering them. Some people who left messages for our reporters even said that along with having no memory of ordering the products, they also had no charges on their credit card, yet still received the products at their doorstep.It's possible that some of these apparently unauthorized purchases occurred in the aftermath of what's known as card skimming. The FBI has said of the practice, ""Skimming occurs when devices illegally installed on ATMs, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, or fuel pumps capture data or record cardholders' PINs. Criminals use the data to create fake debit or credit cards and then steal from victims' accounts. It is estimated that skimming costs financial institutions and consumers more than $1 billion each year."""	false
309	Benadryl-brand antihistamine products contain xylitol.	"In June 2023, we received emails from readers about a years-old rumor that was being copied and pasted on Facebook that claimed one or more forms of the allergy relief product Benadryl contain xylitol, a¬†sugar alcohol¬†that is toxic and¬†even deadly¬†to¬†dogs.This rumor had similarities to a previous story we published that claimed McDonald's ice cream contains xylitol.Benadryl is a brand name for¬†diphenhydramine, an antihistamine that's commonly ""used to relieve red, irritated, itchy, watery eyes; sneezing; and runny nose caused by hay fever, allergies, or the common cold,"" according to MedlinePlus.gov.We checked the official website¬†for Benadryl and did not see xylitol listed on any of its pages. We also looked at generic brands of comparable products and did not find any mentions of the ingredient.Still, we double-checked by reaching out to Benadryl's parent company, Johnson & Johnson.By email, Eilyn Segura, a spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson, told us that Benadryl does not contain xylitol. She also said that the product is not intended for use in animals:BENADRYL¬Æ products do not contain Xylitol. BENADRYL¬Æ product labeling states that they are indicated for children and/or adults; these products are not intended for use in animals. Consumers should contact their veterinarian or Animal Poison Control if they have medical concerns or questions or have administered any of our BENADRYL¬Æ products to their pet(s).If readers have any questions about what sorts of medicines are safe to give to their pets, we recommend contacting your veterinarian.The rumor about Benadryl and xylitol was spreading on Facebook as copypasta, a term¬†for online posts where users copy and paste the same text over and over again. Such posts often contain inaccuracies.According to one repost of the rumor, the warning about Benadryl, xylitol, and dogs had been making the rounds online since at least June 2020. It's unclear who published the original post, nor was it clear when that post first appeared online.The copypasta usually began with a story from a purported owner of a female dog named Remi, who said she had experienced health problems after her owner gave her a dose of Benadryl:PSA‚Ä¶ ALL DOG OWNERS: Reposted.......Please read and share! (This was not my dog).On Sunday night our dog Remi was bit or stung by something.. we sadly still don't know what.. she was vomiting and had hives. We did like most pet owners, looked on the internet and quickly gave her Benadryl, sadly she worsened almost immediately.At 2:45 in the morning we rushed her to the emergency clinic. When she arrived, her pupils were nonresponsive, and she was experiencing tremors. They rushed her in and got her hooked up to IV and on meds. Her glucose level when we arrived was only 36 and her liver and kidneys were compromised.By 6 AM she had stabilized but was still not safe. At 7:30 we had to transport her to another vet clinic more capable of helping her . She spent the day there and was able to come home that eveningShe is now recovering well at home and we are thankful we did not lose her..For three days I've been trying to figure out what went wrong and why she reacted to the Benadryl the way she did.. with the help of Dr. Brown from Fedore Vet Clinic we realized the liquid gelcaps Benadryl that I gave her had an ingredient (Xylitol) that is highly toxic to dogs. So why didn't the internet provide that warning for us?The FDA has dropped the new warning that, while it's just fine for people, the sweetener, Xylitol, has proven to be fatal for dogs.Benadryl allergy liquid gelcaps have this in them....XylitolXylitol also labeled as Tree Gum, Wood Sugar, Birch Sugar or Birch Wood Extract is an artificial sweetener found in everything from toothpaste to peanut butter to sugar-free gum and it's poisonous to dogs.READ THE LABELSIt's now up to our dog community to spread the word and keep our dogs safe.The post said that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a warning about xylitol being deadly if consumed by dogs. This was true.However, again, the claim that Benadryl products contain xylitol is false, according to the company that makes the product."	false

So she alerted her trainer, who sent her a ‚Äúnasty email‚Äù calling her ‚Äúsloppy and unprofessional.‚ÄùDurham said she took the matter to her supervisor, who, along with the trainer, ‚Äúthrew her under the bus.‚ÄùLater, Durham said, she was given a set of performance expectations that required her to close cases at a faster pace. She acknowledged it took her time to adjust to the caseload in Roanoke after coming from rural Craig County, but said she exceeded all expectations.However, Durham said, she was told that it was actually because of her gun permit:The next day, at about 4:30 p.m. Friday, she was summoned to the office of the assistant director of the department, was told she was being fired and given the document listing the reasons. At the top, she said, was a concern about ‚Äúworkplace safety.‚ÄùDurham said she asked about it and was told by the assistant director that her possession of a concealed weapons permit made her a safety risk in the building and for co-workers.Three Roanoke police officers escorted her to her desk, Durham said, where her personal possessions were loaded onto a cart and pushed to her car by one of the officers while the two others escorted her out of the building.We obtained a copy of the official police report in response to our request, which reads in part:Mr. Goss advised that she has a conceal carry permit and believed that she usually has a weapon in her vehicle.... We arrived at 1547 hours. The call was reported on the 3rd floor (Social Services Department). Upon arrival to the 3rd floor we were escorted to one of the offices in the back where we met with Mr. Goss and another employee advising us they wanted us there because they didn't know how Ms. Durham was going to react to the situation.On 13 March 2018, a copy of Storm Durham's termination letter was shared by WSLS.com. In it, ""performance concerns, attendance, dress code issues and unprofessional behavior"" were cited as the reasons for her dismissal:"	false

"At the end of November 2021, a video went viral on social media that supposedly showed a child yelling ""shut the f*ck up"" at first lady Jill Biden as she read a story during a holiday celebration.But the audio in this video has been altered. A child did not scream obscenities at Biden.¬†The above-displayed video was created by taking the audio from an unrelated video and playing it over the video of Biden. The original audio comes from a years-old video of a child yelling at a teacher.¬†The audio in the Biden viral video is doctored, but the visuals are real. She really did read a story to a group of children after she unveiled the Christmas decorations at the White House. According to ABC News, Biden read a book she wrote in 2012 called ""Don't Forget, God Bless Our Troops.""The kids sported masks and wrist bands to indicate they have been COVID-19 tested, and the first lady read her 2012 children's book, ""Don't Forget, God Bless our Troops."" PBS Kids held a holiday puppet show to mark the festive occasion, and the children appeared starstruck at a performance by the Kraft Brothers.While the children did not yell any obscenities at the first lady, there was at least one somewhat awkward moment when one of the children told Biden about his deceased hamster.The Independent reported:Sitting in front of a huge, richly decorated Christmas tree in the State Dining Room, she paused to ask the children how much money they got from the tooth fairy and whether they had any pets.One boy answered ""I have one!"" and then elaborated: ""We used to have, like, hamsters and hedgehogs, but one went under the cage door and then suffocated.""Dr Biden responded: ""Oh my word! Okay, let‚Äôs move on to happier things."" She then rapidly took up her book again.Here's a genuine video of Biden reading this story during this White House event. Biden first appears around the 30-minute mark.¬†https://www.c-span.org/video/?516345-1/lady-remarks-white-house-holiday-decoration-volunteers¬†¬†"	false

2687	Upon his death, Benjamin Franklin bequeathed $2,000 each to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia to be invested in community philanthropic initiatives 200 years later.	In the year preceding his 1790 death, Benjamin Franklin bequeathed $2,000 each to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia to be invested in community philanthropic initiatives 200 years later.¬†The claim was posted to Facebook by the page History Hustle on Aug. 20, 2021. At the time of this writing, the post had more than 19,000 shares.And according to The Franklin Institute, a science museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, it‚Äôs true. Franklin bequeathed the cities of Boston and Philadelphia that sum upon his death in 1790.‚ÄúWhile Franklin is well-known for his scientific accomplishments, he also was quite a successful businessman (although certainly not a billionaire). Upon his death in 1790, he left a large amount of his fortune to the cities of Boston, where he was born, and Philadelphia ... A reasonable portion of that money has gone on to support organizations including The Franklin Institute,‚Äù wrote the Franklin Institute.The Pennsylvania-based philanthropic organization Centre Foundation, which also received funds from the Ben Franklin Fund, noted that Franklin left $2,000 to the city of Philadelphia and another $2,000 to the city of Boston and directed both governments to forego drawing the funds for a century and distributing for two.‚ÄúThe funds were invested, and after the first 100 years, the funds began making personal loans to the citizens of Philadelphia. After the 200 years were up, the State of Pennsylvania directed the money to be split between most of the community foundations in the state,‚Äù wrote the Centre Foundation, who has distributed grants from the funds to charities in various counties around the state.In 1990, the Pennsylvania Legislature used some of the then-$2 million total to create the Ben Franklin Funds and have allocated monetary gifts to several foundations and institutions, including the Washington County Community Foundation, the Lehigh Community Foundation, the Foundation for Enhancing Communities, and the Chester County Community Foundation, among others.According to a now-archived article published by The New York Times at the time of the 1990 disbursement, the $2,000 fund in the Boston trust, meanwhile, was worth about $4.5 million.¬†The scientist, inventor, and ultimately philanthropist is credited with saying, ‚ÄúIf you would not be forgotten, as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading or do things worth the writing.‚ÄùSources$2,000 in 1790 ‚Üí 2021 | Inflation Calculator. https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1790?amount=2000.

Dressed as Cousin Eddie from the holiday classic ‚ÄúNational Lampoons Christmas Vacation,‚Äù a Kentucky man wearing a ushanka hat, bathrobe, socks, and slippers subbed out his snow shovel for a flamethrower over the 2020 Christmas holiday weekend.Several videos shared to Facebook on Dec. 25 showed Timothy Browning ‚Äî a self-described husband, father, and flight nurse ‚Äî melting snow from the driveway as he chugged what appeared to be a beer.‚ÄúSome people use a shovel, others use a flamethrower!!‚Äù wrote Facebook user Jordan Podunavac, who shared a video of Browning from across the street. At the time of Snopes publication, the now-viral video had received more than 45,000 likes interactions on the social media platform, and had been featured in a number of news publications, from Fox to Yahoo. The video was even posted on actor Will Smith's¬†personal Instagram page, where it received more than 11 million views.‚ÄúBrowning Snow Services Removal, now available,‚Äù said the person filming in the second set of videos. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs how you clear a driveway.‚ÄùSnopes contacted Browning, who said that he did not obtain any sort of special permits to use his handheld flamethrower and that its use was legal to the best of his knowledge. According to flamethrower manufacturer XM42-M ‚Äî which is not the same brand Browning used ‚Äî it is legal to own flamethrowers in 48 states, excluding California and Maryland. However, the company suggests that individuals hoping to purchase a flamethrower first check with their local laws and ordinances.Surprisingly, the flamethrower was an effective strategy at removing snow. When asked if the melted snow refroze, Browning confirmed that it had not.‚Äú[The flame] is shooting out at over 1,000 [degrees]. It absolutely vaporized whatever it touched,‚Äù he told Snopes.¬†Browning said that he normally starts campfires with the flamethrower, but finding a reason to use it in the winter was a plus.‚ÄúMy son and I scraped off the snow with shovels earlier, but there was still a thick layer of ice. My grandmother and mother were coming over, and we didn‚Äôt want them to fall,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI figured, why not try this? It worked great.‚ÄùAs to his slumber party attire, Browning said that he was ‚Äú100%‚Äù inspired by Cousin Eddie.‚ÄúOur Christmas party this year was cut short due to COVID, and this was my outfit for it.

Lauren Boebert's impeachment articles again President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris included the misspelled slogan ""IMEACH BIDEN."""	"The spelling of ""impeach"" was quickly corrected in a re-issued news release.In September 2021, some internet users gleefully shared screenshots that appeared to suggest controversial first-term Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, R-Colorado, or more likely her staff, had included an embarrassing typo in her initial announcement that she had prepared articles of impeachment against U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.On Sept. 24, for example, political reporter Jake Sherman tweeted about Boebert's news release, writing: ""Lauren Boebert has sent a release calling to impeach Biden, but she has messed up the logo here,"" along with the large, capitalized, white-on-blue slogan ""IMEACH BIDEN"" (rather than ""IMPEACH BIDEN""):Such descriptions and reports were entirely accurate. On the afternoon of Sept. 24, Boebert issued a news release in which she announced she had prepared articles of impeachment against both Biden and Harris. That announcement contained exactly the misspelled logo shared on social media by Sherman and many others, and by later on that afternoon, #IMEACHBIDEN was a trending topic on Twitter.An archived version of the original news release can be found here.

2978	"Former U.N Ambassador Nikki Haley ""changed her name"" to a less foreign-sounding one."	"Nikki Haley was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa to Punjabi Sikh immigrants. She has gone by her middle name, a Punjabi word for ""little one,"" since well before she entered political life. Nikki Haley, the former Governor of South Carolina and former ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, has long battled allegations that she ""whitewashed"" her Indian roots in service of her political career.In 2020, for example, in response to a speech in which Haley asserted that ""America is not a racist country,"" a group called South Asians for Biden tweeted (and later deleted) the question ‚ÄúIf America isn‚Äôt racist, why did Nimrata Haley feel compelled to change her name to ‚ÄòNikki‚Äô?""This talking point re-emerged in late April 2021, when Haley tweeted her objection to ""wokeism"" and made the assertion that ""Democrats want to teach white kids that they're racist and minority kids that the deck is stacked against them."" In response to that tweet, several commenters, including activist Bree Newsome, repeated the allegation that Haley had changed her name (to a less foreign-sounding one):This talking point is problematic for several reasons. Haley was born to Punjabi Indian immigrants and was named Nimrata Nikki Randhawa. Her legal middle name has this been Nikki since her birth -- she did not choose that name, nor did she ""anglicize"" her first name from Nimrata to Nikki.Second, while Nikki is a common American nickname, it is a Punjabi one as well. As Tunku Varadarajan explained in a Wall Street Journal editorial, ‚Äú'Nikki' is a Punjabi word that means 'little one,' often used as a term of endearment for the youngest girl in a Sikh family.""Finally, Haley did not adopt the name Nikki as a way to boost her political career, as she has used that name since long before she entered the political arena. For example, she identified herself as Nikki Randhawa in her 1989 high school yearbook. In 1997, she married Michael Haley and took her husband's last name, becoming Nikki Haley."	false

"U.S. President Donald Trump has long touted himself as the consummate deal-maker, as reflected in his co-authorship of the 1987 book ""The Art of the Deal."" (Both the book's co-author and its publisher have disputed Trump's claims that he wrote some or all of it, asserting that credited co-author Tony Schwartz was responsible for the entirety of the work, and that Trump contributed nothing to it but his name.)But Trump's vaunted deal-making abilities were often stymied once he ascended to the White House, particularly when he sought a legislative agreement on a coronavirus economic relief package for Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic in August 2020. Unable to reach an agreement with Congress, Trump instead did an end run around that body and resorted to signing directives of questionable legality and effectiveness, as The New York Times reported:
President Trump took executive action to circumvent Congress and try to extend an array of federal pandemic relief, resorting to a legally dubious set of edicts whose impact was unclear, as negotiations over an economic recovery package appeared on the brink of collapse.It was not clear what authority Mr. Trump had to act on his own on the measures or what immediate effect, if any, they would have, given that Congress controls federal spending. But his decision to sign the measures ‚Äî billed as a federal eviction ban, a payroll tax suspension, and relief for student borrowers and $400 a week for the unemployed ‚Äî reflected the failure of two weeks of talks between White House officials and top congressional Democrats to strike a deal on a broad relief plan as crucial benefits have expired with no resolution in sight.
Trump's critics responded by circulating a purported tweet from 2014, in which Trump had supposedly criticized his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for doing what he himself would do in August 2020 (i.e., ""subverting the Constitution of the U.S. because he is unable to negotiate with Congress""):In this instance the tweet was no fabrication or prank, but something Trump really tweeted on November 20, 2014, just after Obama announced he would be making a series of administrative changes to the immigration system.

1473	A young Theodore Roosevelt was photographed in a distant window during Abraham Lincoln's funeral procession in New York.	"On Jan. 23, 2022, a TikTok video purported to show a 6-year-old Theodore Roosevelt, better known as Teddy, visible in a distant window in a photograph of Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs funeral procession in New York, in 1865. The procession traveled by train, making a number of stops on the way to burial in his hometown of Springfield, Illinois. Lincoln died on April 15 of that year after being shot the day before by John Wilkes Booth during a performance at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C.While it‚Äôs not possible to clearly see the faces of the two little children who were visible in the picture shot on Broadway near Union Square, an eyewitness confirmed that they were Teddy Roosevelt and his brother, Elliott.Thirty-six years after the photograph was taken, Roosevelt took the presidential oath of office, serving in the White House from 1901-1909.The picture of Roosevelt with Lincoln‚Äôs funeral procession heading north on Broadway in New York was believed to have been shot on April 24, 1865. At the time, 849 Broadway was the home of Roosevelt‚Äôs father, Cornelius. Roosevelt and his brother, Elliott, are visible in the second-story window of the four-story mansion on the left. The shadows in the photograph appear to show that the sun is in the west, meaning that it was in the afternoon. (Courtesy: Robert N.

It's possible that his sons, Teddy and Elliott, were looking out of the window to try to spot their father. (Thank you to the reader who sent in this information.)An article from The New York Times that was written by presidential historian Michael Beschloss¬†said that the original glass plate negative appeared to be safeguarded by the New York Historical Society.At least two other photographs shot from the same angle also exist. For example, this picture shows the shutters closed in the second-story window. The people walking on Broadway also have shorter shadows, likely meaning that the photograph was shot earlier in the day: Courtesy: Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG via Getty ImagesA third picture shows the shutters in the second-story window slightly open. Judging from the length of the shadows, it‚Äôs perhaps likely that this photograph was taken sometime before or after the one that showed Roosevelt and his brother: Courtesy: Library of CongressOn Feb. 10, 1984, The Boston Globe published how Roosevelt was discovered to be in the photograph that was taken at Lincoln‚Äôs funeral procession. According to the newspaper, the discovery was made by a photojournalist named Stefan Lorant:One of Lorant‚Äôs favorite Lincoln picture stories concerns a photograph he found in the files of the New York City Public Library. It shows crowds gathered on the sidewalk watching Lincoln‚Äôs funeral procession pass by. When he asked the librarian if he could identify the site, Lorant was told it was Union Square and that the house belonged to Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs grandfather, Van Schaack Roosevelt.Lorant spotted two little children watching the funeral from a second-floor window. ‚ÄúI asked myself who would grandfather invite to the funeral of President Lincoln,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúCould a future president be watching as his predecessor passed by?‚ÄùIn 1948, Lorant had a chance to interview Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs widow, Edith, in connection with the book, ‚ÄúThe Life and Times of Theodore Roosevelt.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you remember whether your husband ever told you he saw Lincoln‚Äôs funeral?,‚Äù Lorant asked.‚ÄúThat horrible man,‚Äù Mrs. Roosevelt screamed. She went on to explain that she had been 3 or 4 years old at the time and a friend of the Roosevelt children, who told her to come to the house to watch the funeral procession. ‚ÄúAll the lamps were covered with black cloth,‚Äù she told Lorant. ‚ÄúI got frightened and cried.‚Äù Then her future husband, who was not quite and his brother Elliott (father of Eleanor Roosevelt) locked her in a closet. ‚ÄúMr. Lorant,‚Äù the 87-year-old woman cried, ‚ÄúI never saw Lincoln‚Äôs funeral.‚ÄùLorant remembers he was so enchanted by the spritely woman that he said, ‚ÄúMrs. Roosevelt,‚Äù if I would be 10 years older, I would propose to you.‚Äù ‚ÄúMr. Lorant,‚Äù she replied, ‚Äúif I were ten years younger, I would accept.‚Äù This picture shows Edith Roosevelt, widow of Theodore Roosevelt, as she was photographed on Sept. 16, 1935, in New York.

She passed away on Sept. 30, 1948.Lorant was born in Hungary in 1901 and died in Minnesota in 1997. During his life, he was able to personally locate several original Lincoln photographs that had not yet been known about by the general public.In 1941, Lorant published a book about Lincoln titled, ‚ÄúLincoln: His Life in Photographs.‚Äù That was followed up in 1952 with ‚ÄúLincoln: A Picture Story of His Life.‚Äù"	true

M√ºller provided an answer by pointing to his interpretation of Bible verses, saying he believed the son of God to be Jesus Christ, and the son of man to be Trump, meaning he believed there to be two Christs:You know that Jesus, the Son of God always spoke about the Son of MAN in a third person?""For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words (Jesus, the Son of God), of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own¬†glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.""Have you not notice how Jesus, the Son of God spoke in the first person about himself and always referred to the Son of MAN in the third person?M√ºller also told us that he believed there to be a comparison between Jesus being betrayed by Judas and Trump purportedly being ""betrayed by Pence,"" purportedly referring to the former U.S. vice president's decision to follow the U.S. Constitution rather than overturning the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election based on conspiracy theories. (In reality, no credible evidence of massive voter fraud has ever been produced to show that the election was ""stolen,"" as Trump often claimed.)Following the Ohio rally, M√ºller uploaded a video that provided a longer explanation as to why he believed Trump to be ""the son of man"" and ""the Christ,"" as mentioned on the cover of his book. ""Don't get offended. Don't say, 'Ew, that's blasphemous,'"" he said. ""Jesus is the king of the Jews. Trump is the king of kings."""	true

452	In the U.S., Mother's Day sees less crime than any other day of the year.	"As Mother's Day approached in May 2022, a popular joke recirculated on social media that provided a humorous explanation as to why this annual holiday supposedly had historically low crime rates. Mother's Day saw so little crime, the joke offered, because the holiday prevented moms from going on their regular crime sprees.My mom is a prosecutor and every year she brings up the fact that Mother's Day is the day with the lowest crime. I think that says a lot about how many moms commit crimes throughout the year, but can't today because they're too busy being celebrated.This joke has been repeated in memes and in TikTok videos with tens of thousands of views.While the second half of this meme was clearly meant as a punchline for a joke, some people wondered if the first half had any truth. Is Mother's Day historically known for low crime rates?While the joke's language did not make clear where, or under what law enforcement jurisdiction, crime rates supposedly reached low points on Mother's Day, for the purpose of this fact check, we attempted to prove or disprove the claim for the U.S., specifically.That said, the claim that Mother's Day in the U.S. has less crime than any other day of the year does not appear to be supported by any evidence. We weren't able to find any studies that supported this claim.The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program generates national crime statistics that law enforcement agencies use nationwide, but these data were not organized in a way to show the number of crimes on any specific date. We reached out to the FBI, and a spokesperson told us that the UCR Program collects ""data on a monthly basis.""With relevant national crime statistics unavailable, we set out to find data from local jurisdictions that could give us an idea if this claim held any water. In Chicago, a spokesperson for the CPD told us: ""We don't have a way to break crime stats down by date/year in this office."" However, we found police databases in two major cities, Minneapolis and New York City, that provided crime statistics on a date-by-date basis.We did a rudimentary search through New York City Police Department (NYPD)'s database to compare the number of arrests (for crimes that ranged from burglary, to assault, to criminal mischief, to rape, to traffic misdemeanors) on Mother's Day compared to other Sundays throughout the year and found that there didn't appear to be anything particularly unusual about the number of arrests on Mother's Day.On Mother's Day on May 10, 2020, for example, NYPD documented 265 arrests. While that was less than the number of arrests the following Sunday (the agency tallied 353 arrests on May 17), we found several dates that saw less crime. For example, in that same year, April 12 saw 196 arrests, April 5 saw 170 arrests, and March 29 saw 152 arrests.Minneapolis' crime dashboard also showed that the number of crimes didn't suspiciously drop on Mother's Day. On Mother's Day on May 9, 2021, for example, the city saw 154 crimes reported. The week prior, there were 138.These rudimentary searches did not show anything unusual about the rate of crime on Mother's Day. In fact, in the two cities we were able to check, we found that Mother's Day wasn't the day with the lowest amount of crime.[Also on Snopes: What are the origins of Mother's Day?]The claim that Mother's Day has less crime than other days of the year can be traced back to a joke that was posted in 2020 by Twitter account @gofinurself. While the person behind the account told us that he remembered his mom ""claiming that it was a day of low crime,"" he couldn't pinpoint where he first heard the rumor. In our search for its origins, we weren't able to find any online examples of the claim that predated @gofinurself's joke.The Twitter user told us that he deleted the original joke after he become ""educated on the topic of mothers who are imprisoned and the affect that has, not only on them, but their families.""The year after @gofinurself's joke first went viral, he posted a new Mother's Day message:The New York Times reported in 2019 that at least 5 million children have a parent in prison, and that nearly 80% of the women in jail have young or teenage children.As the prison population in the United States skyrocketed since 1980, the number of incarcerated women has grown by more than 750 percent, at a rate twice that of men. The increase, according to criminologists, has been driven by a rise in the imprisonment of white women for property and drug-related crimes. And as the population has risen, so, too, has the number of children growing up with a mother or father behind bars [...]The toll it takes on children is often far more severe when the inmate is their mother. More than 60 percent of women in state prisons, and nearly 80 percent of those in jail, have minor children, and most are their primary caretaker.No evidence appears to exist that shows the U.S. has less crime on Mother's Day than other days of the year. In fact, in two metro areas, we found several days in 2020 and 2021 that had less crime than those years' Mother's Day.Furthermore, some groups have actually tied Mother's Day to a rise in certain types of crime. In 2016, Gay Lynn Schwenk with the San Antonio-based Family Violence Prevention Services said the group typically sees an uptick in domestic violence calls around Mother's Day.News 4 Sanantonio reported:'We do see an increase in numbers around this time of the year,' Gay Lynn Schwenk with Family Violence Prevention Services says.The nonprofit runs the shelter. Schwenk is expecting dozens of families to [sic] call in the days following Mother's Day.'One of the things that perpetrators do with moms is to denigrate them and humiliate them in front of their children,' Schwenk says. 'To tell them what horrible mothers they are, that they would never be able to parent those children without them.'"	false
5603	‚ÄúPresidential alerts‚Äù are capable of accessing the E911 chip in your phones, which provides the government full access to your location, microphone, camera and every function of your phone.	"On 3 October 2018, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), conducted a nationwide test of the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) system, an event referred to by many commenters as a ‚ÄúPresidential alert.‚Äù On the day of the test, John McAfee, the controversial founder of the McAfee Antivirus software empire and a current cryptocurrency advocate (as well as 2020 U.S. presidential candidate for the Libertarian party), tweeted an alarming statement about the test:The ""Presidential alerts"": they are capable of accessing the E911 chip in your phones - giving them full access to your location, microphone, camera and every function of your phone. This not a rant, this is from me, still one of the leading cybersecurity experts. Wake up people!‚Äî John McAfee (@officialmcafee) October 3, 2018In this post, we'll describe the myriad hurdles McAfee‚Äôs argument would need to overcome to be accurate, noting that we could find no independent support for the claims he made in that tweet.What is the Presidential Alert System?The ‚Äúpresidential alert‚Äù tested on 3 October 2018 combined a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, or EAS (which is familiar to people as cacophonous weather and/or natural disaster alerts that might interrupt television or radio broadcasts) and the Wireless Emergency Alert system, or WEA (which is familiar to cell phone users who have received Amber alerts or other local emergency alerts).Typically, the WEA system is used by state and local jurisdictions, but the October 2018 test was the first attempt at trying out a nationwide alert via this system for the purposes of conveying a message from the President. Based on a George W. Bush-era law, anyone with a cell phone can opt out of any WEA notification unless that notification is ‚Äúissued at the direction of the President and/or his/her designee.‚Äù While the law has required the EAS to be tested nationwide for the past three years, October 2018 was the first time such a test had been combined with a test of a nationwide WEA alert.What Is John McAfee‚Äôs Argument?In a brief phone interview, McAfee explained to us his view that a nationwide WEA notification could be exploited by the federal government to spy on private citizens. He suggested this could be done by exploiting what he called an ""E911 chip"". He characterized the purpose of this chip as something 911 dispatchers can use to find location information for people who call 911 and either hang up or are incapacitated during the call:Let‚Äôs say a burglar enters your house, assaults you, you call 911, you pass out during the call. They again turn on your camera, your phone, get your location, dispatch police officers. They can then listen to see if there is anyone else in the room. Is there any noise? The location of the camera, whatever it's showing, they can see that. Perfect, that's good. I don't think anybody would have a problem with that.We will discuss the accuracy of that statement later in this post. However, McAfee‚Äôs argument, generally speaking, is that because (he says) the WEA utilizes this ‚ÄúE911 chip,‚Äù they too have the ability to turn on your phone and spy on you:The Federal Government has co-opted a local facility (e.g.,. a 911 call center). Let‚Äôs say you want to know where you've got a bunch of enemies or a bunch of Republicans or some Democrats, you want to know where they are, what they're doing. When you send an alert it doesn't have to make a sound. It doesn't have to display anything because it's listening, watching you, to find out where you are, where you're moving.What is an E911 Chip?According to Ted Rappaport, a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU and the founding director of their NYU WIRELESS research center, ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as an E911 chip in a cell phone.‚Äù Nomenclature aside, McAfee appears to be referring to the technology required by the FCC of modern cellular phones and network providers that assures 911 call centers receive accurate geolocation from mobile phones. The regulations that require such capabilities are broadly referred to as E911 rules.The enhanced 911 (E911) rules were implemented by the FCC in two phases and were aimed at improving ‚Äúthe effectiveness and reliability of wireless 911 services by providing 911 dispatchers with additional information on wireless 911 calls.‚Äù Phase I required cell phones to be capable of communicating to a 911 call center which cellphone tower was utilized in an emergency call. Phase II required wireless carriers ‚Äúto begin providing information that is more precise to [call centers], specifically, the latitude and longitude of the caller.‚Äù The FCC mandated that the accuracy of that information had to meet certain standards depending upon the type of technology used.Most modern cell phones use a combination of two methods to generate that location information: A ‚Äúnetwork-based‚Äù solution which triangulates a caller's location from the cell phone towers near it, and a ‚Äúheadset-based‚Äù solution which is generally a GPS receiver built into the phone. Most modern cell phones contain a GPS receiver chip. It is this chip, McAfee argued to us, that a presidential alert system could exploit.Does The Wireless Emergency Alert System Use an ‚ÄúE911 Chip‚Äù?McAfee asserted that the action of sending out a nationwide alert necessitates access to the GPS or other location services (i.e. the ‚ÄúE911 chip‚Äù) that are part of your phone. FEMA, the federal agency that oversees the WEA, disputes this view, with a FEMA spokesperson telling us:The cell phone functions that receive and display WEA messages are not related or connected to E911 functions in any way. The majority of wireless providers in the United States use Cell Broadcast technology to deliver WEA alert messages to cell phones. Cell Broadcast is a one-way communications protocol. Phones that receive WEA messages choose to display the message if the phone is not busy in a phone call or data session. The WEA message display function in a phone does not use the GPS, microphone, or camera functions of the phone.In essence, what happens when any WEA alert (including Amber alerts and severe weather alerts) go out is that the cell towers in the targeted region will broadcast a signal to all cell phones within receiving distance. This is a passive process, and as such the tower does not require, nor does it obtain, information from the phones that receive the message. The only differences between a ‚ÄúPresidential alert‚Äù and any other WEA alert a phone might already receive are that 1) cell phones are not capable of opting out of WEA notifications from the President according to FCC policy, and 2) WEA notifications target the entire country, not a smaller geographic region.Could a WEA Alert Exploit Your Phone‚Äôs Hardware and Expose Its Location?Because a WEA notification is a passively received signal, it does not add to the list of potential security vulnerabilities in a phone. For that reason, McAfee‚Äôs thesis that the presidential alert is itself a security risk does not hold up.That does not mean, however, that your phone and the software it runs on do not have access to a scary amount of personal data, or that it is not constantly tracking your location and recording you. According to Rappaport, the NYU professor, users almost always (without their knowledge) ‚Äúopt-in‚Äù to a variety of services that utilize the kind of information McAfee is concerned with:It is true that various smartphone operating systems, such as Android and iOS, do collect and process the microphone data of unwitting users, and that our locations and voices are indeed being tracked and mined, processed, and known to the cellphone smartphone operating system, and this information, or processed versions of it, are exchanged between the cell phone's operating system and the end servers across the internet that communicate with the end user applications ...A person‚Äôs location information and audio recordings (or processed versions of the recordings) are supposed to be only used when a customer has ‚Äúopted in‚Äù to use these applications, and when the application has been downloaded on to its phone). If you read the fine print of both the Android and IOS operating systems ... you will be amazed at what users are agreeing to for the use of their data.This type of data is often used by social media sites (Google, Facebook, etc.) to target their advertising to us. As an experiment, you can talk about your pet, and what you feed your pet, and after a few minutes, you will then find a Facebook ad about pet food in your Facebook feed -- I have many of my friends try this, and they are amazed and then quite shaken up.Outside of the issue of a WEA alert's being a passive signal, McAfee‚Äôs thesis also requires accepting the notion that 911 operators have access to those same datasets (the ones described by Rappaport) constantly being created by your phone. That portion of the argument is a bit more factual. As an example, Apple‚Äôs iOS 12 system, which was released in September 2018, utilizes a service that collects and packages your location data to be sent to a 911 center should you make a call:Apple today announced it will also use emergency technology company RapidSOS‚Äôs Internet Protocol-based data pipeline to quickly and securely share [GPS and networked derived] location data with 911 centers, improving response time when lives and property are at risk. RapidSOS‚Äôs system will deliver the emergency location data of iOS users by integrating with many 911 centers‚Äô existing software, which rely on industry-standard protocols ... In keeping with Apple‚Äôs focus on privacy, user data cannot be used for any non-emergency purpose and only the responding 911 center will have access to the user‚Äôs location during an emergency call.We reached out to RapidSOS for a comment on the claims made by McAfee but have not received a response. We have found no evidence, though, that this process could be flipped in reverse, whereby a 911 call center (or any other party) could access this information without your first calling 911. In fact, based on RapidSOS‚Äôs literature, their data transfer process is effectively a one-way signal as well.In their process, your location data is constantly updated and sent to a NG911 (next generation 911) data clearinghouse which is then (if you make a 911 call) transmitted to a call center and displayed alongside the other location data they would normally receive. These data could theoretically include other sources of information, but a user would have to opt-in to those features explicitly.We asked McAfee how he knows that the government, via the introduction of a nationwide alert system, could gain access to this kind of data in a way that did not previously exist before the alert system, and he told us that while no documented evidence of any legislation allowing for such a process existed, ‚Äúevery great security person knows‚Äù it:There is no evidence that any legislation gave the government the power to co-opt the 911 call. It was something that was intended to be activated only if I'm in trouble and call the police. Is now being used by the government to send text messages under the pretext of [a test].I'm the world‚Äôs greatest cyber security specialist, which is basically one of the greatest hackers. I know that because every great cyber security person knows this. People have taken that chip, taken it apart a thousand times.Regardless of what chip McAfee is referring to, his claim rests on the notion that receiving a WEA alert requires governmental access to the geolocation services utilized by 911 centers, a claim which we have found no evidence to support and which FEMA denies. While cell phones do collect data on users (effectively) without their knowledge and do so constantly, we could identify no mechanism by which the perils presented by that reality were in anyway expanded by a presidential alert, since those alerts merely use the same technology that cell phones have employed to receive weather and Amber alerts for years."	false
1545	"A photograph shows a woman attempting to pump gas with a ""sorry, out of service"" bag covering the handle into a car with a Joe Biden bumper sticker."	"A picture of a woman at a gas pump was digitally altered to add a political bumper sticker. It's unclear if the yellow ""out of service"" bag covering the gas pump handle was part of the original photograph.On Sept. 8, 2021, a Facebook user posted a photograph that showed a woman attempting to pump gas with a handle covered by a yellow bag that read, ""sorry, out of service."" Also featured in the picture was a ""Build Back Better Biden"" bumper sticker, purportedly showing that the woman was a supporter of U.S. President Joe Biden.However, further study showed that the bumper sticker was digitally added into the photo, turning a nonpolitical moment into a politically misleading one. Some of the user comments even turned racial. This post only received several hundred shares, but others were spread thousands of times.We found the same digitally altered photograph was tweeted by the conservative organization Young Americans for Liberty and received tens of thousands of shares. The tweet received nearly 3,000 retweets and more than 15,000 likes.The doctored picture was also posted a seemingly endless number of times by other accounts on social media.The oldest post of the picture that we found looked to be from TexasBowhunter.com on May 13, 2021. The car did not appear to have any bumper stickers in that version. It's unclear if other aspects of the photo had also been previously added with digital editing software, such as the yellow ""out of service"" bag.Some social media comments suggested that the woman attempting to pump gas might have been given the yellow bag to protect her hands from potential infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the picture appeared to have been posted in the days following the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, which might make sense in terms of why the gas pump was out of service.Other comments on social media seemed to poke fun at the fact that the woman pumping gas was wearing a mask outdoors. However, it's possible that the woman was experiencing symptoms and was wearing a mask to help protect others while out of her home, something that the CDC recommends.In sum, a photograph of a woman at a gas pump was digitally altered to add a Biden bumper sticker.Sources‚ÄúCOVID-19 and Your Health.‚Äù Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 11 Feb. 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html."	false

4288	CNN lightened the skin tone in a picture of a man accused of driving a car into Seattle protesters.	Spurious social media posts falsely accusing CNN of altering the racial identity of crime suspects in news photographs have become a distinct subclass of misinformation. One example in this vein, from June 2020, claimed the cable news network had lightened the skin tone in a picture of a man who was arrested on June 7, 2020, for driving a car into anti-police-brutality protesters in Seattle:This image originated with a photograph snapped by Dean Rutz of The Seattle Times, which accompanied an Associated Press article on the incident:However, the report of this incident published by CNN on its website didn't use this photograph at all, much less in an altered form. We also found no evidence that this image was a screen capture from a CNN televised report, nor does the placement of the CNN logo onto the image correspond with the way CNN displays such pictures during their telecasts.	false
5550	Barron Trump has earned the title of Chess Grandmaster.	"In mid-October 2018, dozens of social media accounts started circulating the claim that Barron Trump, the youngest son of President Donald Trump, had been awarded the title of Chess Grandmaster:The tweets pushing this rumor also made several other outlandish claims: Some held that Barron Trump had an IQ of 146; others maintained that Barron's father Donald Trump studied under chess legend Bobby Fischer and was himself one of the most celebrated chess players of all time. Many of these tweets were also accompanied by the accusation that the mainstream news media was ignoring the many chess-related accomplishments of the Trump family.While it's true that mainstream news has largely ignored these stories, that circumstance isn't due to any perceived bias. These reports were left uncovered for the simple fact that they were untrue.The claim that Barron Trump was awarded the tile of Chess Grandmaster stemmed from an October 2017 satirical article published on the web site The Daily Chronicle:Everyone knows Barron Trump is the smartest President‚Äôs kid ever. Or should we call him First Son?Either way, Barron has been awarded the prestigious title of Chess Grandmaster this week from the International Board of Chessmasters ...This should be no surprise considering who is father is. Donald Trump is one of the highest ranked and most celebrated American chess players of all time.In the 1970s and 80s, Donald Trump studied under the tutelage of players like Bobby Fischer. Eventually, he won hundreds of chess tournaments abroad before retiring at the ripe old age of 40.Although the Daily Chronicle website states that they are ""All About The Facts, Not Feelings"" on their About page, they acknowledge that they publish satirical content in their privacy disclaimer.We double-checked anyway and found that Barron Trump was not listed among the 1600+ Chess Grandmasters in the World Chess Federation's database."	false
3117	Texas high school students were disciplined after participating in a mock slave auction on Snapchat.	"In March 2021, Texas school district administrators learned of a purported mock slave auction organized by high school students on Snapchat. The students attended the Don R. Daniel Ninth Grade Campus at Aledo High School. They were subsequently disciplined by the Aledo Independent School District. Aledo is a suburb of Fort Worth.The news was first reported by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on April 12. It published that the students who participated in the group pretended to sell their Black classmates. They placed mock bids and posted comments about the bids.A screenshot showed that the group name had at various times included the words ""slave trade,"" ""farm,"" and ""auction."" When the screenshot was captured, the group name appeared to be a racial epithet followed by the word ""auction.""It also showed that one student bid $100 on a Black classmate. Another mock bid was $1 with the comment: ""Would be better if his hair wasn't so bad."" Courtesy: WFAA-TV/Fort Worth Star-TelegramAn emoji posted by Texas students in the mock slave auction showed a Black man with a straw hat. In one case, the emoji of the Black man in a straw hat was followed by a green water pistol and an emoji of a police officer.Most platforms no longer allow emojis of real firearms. The next closest emoji offered for users is the green water pistol.A spokesperson with the Aledo Independent School District told us that state and federal law prohibit schools from publicly disclosing disciplinary actions taken on students.In a statement sent to Snopes, Aledo Superintendent Susan Bohn said that the school district ""made a formal determination that racial harassment and cyberbullying had occurred."" She also noted that disciplinary action had been taken:There is no room for racism or hatred in the Aledo ISD, period. Using inappropriate, offensive, and racially charged language and conduct is completely unacceptable and is prohibited by district policy.More than two weeks ago, the district learned of an incident that involved students from the Daniel Ninth Grade Campus bullying and harassing other students based on their race and launched an immediate and thorough investigation that involved law enforcement. We made a formal determination that racial harassment and cyberbullying had occurred and assigned disciplinary consequences in accordance with our policy and the Student Code of Conduct. This incident has caused tremendous pain for the victims, their families, and other students of color and their families, and for that, we are deeply saddened.After being notified of the incident, the Aledo ISD immediately engaged in conversations and communication with students and the student group that was involved, as well as their parents, and made it clear that statements and conduct that targets a student because of his or her race is not only prohibited but also has a profound impact on the victims. We also shared this message with staff and parents at the campus.The Aledo ISD will continue to take action to ensure students, staff, and parents in our community understand the negative impact of racism and other forms of harassment on victims as well as the consequences of these actions at school through district-led educational opportunities.We live in a community that comes together in support of its children and families, especially in difficult times, and we want our students of color to understand that they are loved and supported in Aledo ISD. We ask that our parents and community continue to have important conversations with their children at home about racism and other forms of harassment as we all work together as a community to support our Bearcats.The Associated Press also reported that Eddie Burnett, president of Parker County NAACP, ""said he plans to take up the matter with the Aledo Independent School District board.""In an interview with WFAA-TV, Burnett said: ""'It's just kids. They're just playing. They don't know any better.' Well damn, teach them better."""	true
3728	The theory that a coal fire may have accelerated the sinking of the Titanic ‚Äî along with supporting photographs presented in a 2017 documentary ‚Äî had been covered up for decades.	"Since at least February 2020, an online advertisement appeared across the internet, displayed on websites that partnered with the Taboola advertising platform: ""Experts Reveal The Potentially Hidden Truth Behind The Titanic.""Readers who clicked on the ad were led to a story on a website called Serendipity Times. Its headline read: ""Experts Discovered The Real Reason The Titanic Sank ‚Äì And The Truth Had Been Covered Up For Decades.""This story was a variation of our previous reporting on the theory that a coal fire had accelerated the sinking of the Titanic.In 2017, a new documentary was released, titled, ""Titanic: The New Evidence."" The crux of the documentary was that photographs had been found that were captured during the ill-fated ship's construction. The pictures purportedly supported the theory that a coal fire on the ship's hull was ignored.However, the Serendipity Times advertisement and headline were misleading. There was no indication that the coal fire theory or the documentary's found photographs had been ""covered up for decades."" The words ""covered up"" implied purposeful deceit, for which there was no evidence. In reality, the pictures had simply been gathering dust in an attic. The coal fire theory itself also was not new.As for the legitimacy of the coal fire theory and the 2017 documentary, our previous reporting took an in-depth look into both.Further, reporting from The New York Times said that experts found the coal fire theory to be ""compelling, but were divided over how important a role the fire may have played.""In an interview, Richard de Kerbrech, a marine engineer based on the Isle of Wight who has written two books on the Titanic disaster, said that the fire would have damaged the ship‚Äôs bulkhead, a wall of steel within the ship‚Äôs hull, and made it more vulnerable after it was pierced by an iceberg. An official British inquiry, in 1912, mentioned the fire, but the judge who presided over it, whom critics saw as sympathetic to shipping interests, played it down.‚ÄúThis discovery is a revelation and could change our knowledge of the history of what happened,‚Äù Mr. de Kerbrech said.The story from the Times also quoted David Hill, described as ""a former honorary secretary of the British Titanic Society."" He argued that, ""while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster, the blaze was not the decisive factor.""""When the Titanic hit the iceberg close to midnight on April 14, 1912, it created a 300-foot-long line of damage on the starboard section of the hull, including punctures and gashes, that opened up too many compartments to the sea, so that the weight of the water dragged the bow down so low that the ship eventually sank,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA fire may have accelerated this. But in my view, the Titanic would have sunk anyways.""He added: ""It amazes me how this ship still captures the global imagination. It was not the worst-ever catastrophe at sea. But it is the one everyone remembers.""We previously covered another story about an ""old camera"" found on the ocean floor that purportedly had photographs from the Titanic. This false claim had also first appeared in misleading online advertisements."	false

6246	Robert Mueller will soon be resigning due to the disclosure of his long-term affair with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi:	"On 2 December 2017, the Ladies of Liberty web site published an article reporting that Robert Mueller, the former FBI director who now heads the Special Counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, would soon be resigning his position due to the disclosure of his long-term affair with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi:Robert Mueller‚Äôs steamy, 13-year affair with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is going to cost him more than a little bit of embarrassment and his marriage, according to a trusted source inside the Department of Justice.

3655	"Queen Elizabeth II told Meghan Markle to ""STOP."""	"In December 2020, the website Trendcatchers apparently paid to display online advertising that promised a purported bombshell in British royal family news: ""Royal Latest: When The Queen Told Meghan Markle To STOP."" At least two of the advertisements included photographs with circles to misleadingly draw in readers.One of the advertisements circled Markle's hand in red:Another circled something about Markle's legs in yellow:The advertisements for the story had likely been running well before December 2020. Both led to a lengthy slideshow article that lasted longer than 60 pages. The Aug. 7, 2019, slideshow story was titled: ""Will The British Public Ever Accept Meghan Markle As Royal? Most People Don‚Äôt Think So.""Even before Meghan Markle officially became a royal, the press has always been unimpressed by the actress turned duchess. From infamous exes to tight smiles, Markle always seemed a bit too haughty.This led to the constant media scrutiny and general dislike from the British public, which has led many to believe that Meghan Markle might never be able to truly fit into the royal family and here is the proof.However, the long article mentioned nothing about the queen telling Meghan Markle to ""stop."" The 60+ pages resembled little other than tabloid rumors about the royal family. The word ""stop"" only showed up once, and it had nothing to do with the queen or Meghan Markle.We previously reported on other viral rumors about the royal family. We spotted a baseless online advertisement that claimed the royal family was ""cringing"" at Meghan Markle's net worth. The resulting slideshow story mentioned nothing of the sort. Another advertisement said that ""Prince Harry has changed his mind about Meghan Markle,"" which was not true. We saw an outdated bit of news about ""an unexpected baby bombshell"" that was still circulating as new about the former Kate Middleton. There's also a fake picture that purportedly showed Harry and Meghan posing in front of a big RV camper."	false
478	In 2023, Chelsea Clinton declared all U.S. children must be forced to get mRNA vaccines (which include COVID-19 vaccines) without parents' consent.	"On May 7, 2023, a website called The People's Voice published¬†a story claiming that Chelsea Clinton had said every child in America needed to be ""force-jabbed"" with vaccines.The article claimed:Chelsea Clinton: 'It's Time To Force-Jab Every Unvaccinated Child in America'Chelsea Clinton has declared that unvaccinated children in America must be forced to take the mRNA jab with or without parental consent.Chelsea ‚Äì via the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) ‚Äì along with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says she hopes to force jab unvaccinated children via a new initiative called ""The Big Catch-up.""The People's Voice article appeared to be the source of the rumor about Clinton. We found social media posts linking to the article on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. The People's Voice is a rebrand¬†of Newspunch, a long-time and well-known producer of misinformation.When I first saw this, I thought it was a joke. I was wrong. Wow. Just wow. https://t.co/ai6nT6XEJr‚Äî Steve Kirsch (@stkirsch) May 8, 2023The underlying claim in the People's Voice story, as well as the social media posts, was false. We found no evidence that Clinton said every U.S. child should get mRNA vaccines without parental consent.It appeared to be based on remarks she made during a conference hosted by Fortune in April 2023, in which she promoted routine vaccinations of children globally to curb the spread of preventable viruses. At the event, she was promoting a public health initiative to vaccinate children against diseases such as measles and polio ‚Äî not COVID-19 ‚Äî globally, particularly in some countries outside of the U.S. where the rate of such immunizations remains low.As far as the alleged quote from Clinton serving as the headline for the article by The People's Voice, we watched footage of Clinton's appearance at the Fortune conference from an article written by the publication, searched Clinton's social media accounts, and analyzed reputable news articles, and could not find evidence of Clinton saying anything resembling ""It's time to force-jab every unvaccinated child in America."" The headline appeared to be a fabricated quote.""The Big Catch-up"" is a real initiative led by the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi, UNICEF, the Vaccine Alliance, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, according to an April 24, 2023, joint news release from the organizations.¬†The initiative is focused on routine vaccines, which are recommended for all patients depending on age and vaccine history and aim to prevent outbreaks of diseases like measles, diphtheria, polio, and yellow fever.¬†The initiative was not related¬†to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The Big Catch-up"" is particularly focused on increasing immunization in countries where three quarters of children missed vaccines in 2021.¬†The U.S. was not one of those countries.¬†The press release also did not mention mRNA vaccines, which include most COVID-19 vaccines. While the news release said that the initiative would call on leaders of other countries to reach the children who had missed vaccines, it did not say that unvaccinated children from those countries would be ""force-jabbed"" or vaccinated without parental consent.At the Fortune event that seemingly fueled the rumored statements about mandatory vaccinations, Clinton said the initiative's purpose was to ""catch kids up on their routine immunizations."" Like the press release, she did not mention mRNA vaccines, or parental consent, despite what The People's Voice article claimed she said. We found the remarks beginning at 3:09 in the video:And the last thing I'll say is a new effort that we're a part of is the new initiative launched by the World Health Organization last week to try to catch kids up on their routine immunizations. In 2021 alone, more than 25 million kids under the age of one missed at least one routine immunization. And so we're working with WHO and the Gates Foundation and others to hopefully have the largest¬†kind of childhood immunization effort ever over the next 18 months to catch as many kids up as possible. Because no one should die of polio or measles or pneumonia, including in this country, where we also need people to be vaccinating their kids.In sum, the initiative cited by Clinton in an interview that was framed as her promoting forced mRNA vaccinations of children in the U.S.. was actually an effort to vaccinate children in countries with low immunization levels against viruses other than COVID-19. There was no evidence of the effort forcing vaccines on children without parents' approval.¬†For those reasons, we rate this claim False."	false
2612	Pfizer is developing an oral COVID-19 drug that is just a clone of the anti-parasite drug Ivermectin.	"Pfizer is developing an oral drug to prevent COVID-19 infections. This drug, currently known as PF-07321332, is a protease inhibitor ""designed to block the activity of the main protease enzyme that the coronavirus needs to replicate."" This drug is not a repackaged version of ivermectin. Snopes is still fighting an ‚Äúinfodemic‚Äù of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. 
In September 2021, a number of news outlets reported on a new oral drug that was being developed by Pfizer to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. As these reports circulated online, some social media users jokingly dubbed the new drug ""Pfizermectin,"" a combination of the company's name and the drug ivermectin ‚Äî a medication that was developed to treat parasite infections that has been the source of both confusion and controversy ‚Äî and claimed that Pfizer was copying or cloning the drug.¬†Before we get to ""Pfizermectin,"" let's look at why ivermectin has become controversial.¬†Ivermectin is used to treat parasitic worms in both humans and farm animals. The developers of this drug won the Nobel Prize in 2015 after the drug was found to be quite successful at fighting River Blindness and Lymphatic Filariasis. While this drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for parasite infections, it has not been approved¬†as a treatment for COVID-19.¬†Some studies, however, have suggested that ivermectin may have potential as a treatment for COVID-19, but those studies have largely been inconclusive. This has still led some people to try to self-medicate with the drug, and in some cases, for people to self-medicate with the horse version of the drug. In short, ivermectin is not (yet) an approved treatment for COVID-19.¬†No.¬†The above-displayed tweet claims that Pfizer's new drug, PF-07321332, is simply ivermectin with a new name. That is not true.The tweet then claims that Pfizer is rebranding this drug so that it can make the medication more expensive. That's nonsensical.Those spreading this claim appear to be under the belief that ""Big Pharma"" is stealing an independently produced drug, partnering with government agencies to get the drug quickly approved, and then hiking up the price as it goes to market. But there are a few problems with this theory.¬†For one, ivermectin is already produced by the ""Big Pharma"" company Merck. If Pfizer was truly copying this drug, it seems plausible that Merck would be pushing back in the press or in lawsuits. But that hasn't been the case.¬†Furthermore, ivermectin is already an approved drug by the FDA for its originally intended use: to treat parasite infections. The drug has not been approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19 because the drug has not been proven to be an effective treatment against COVID-19.¬†A more nuanced version of the ""Pfizermectin"" rumor claims that both Pfizer's new drug and ivermectin act as ""potent protease inhibitors,"" which, according to social media users, basically makes them the same drug. But that's not the case.¬†Ivermectin was not developed as a protease inhibitor. This claim comes from a March 2021 study that investigated the efficacy of ivermectin as an antiviral drug. That study found that ivermectin was a ""blocker of viral replicase, protease and human TMPRSS2.""¬†¬†But protease inhibitors are a class of antiviral drugs that have been used to treat HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C. In other words, there are several different drugs that act as a protease inhibitors (""Protease is an enzyme in the body,"" according to Healthline, and ""Protease inhibitor drugs block the action of protease enzymes""). Just because two drugs may perform a similar function does not mean that they interchangeable or identical.¬†A spokesperson for Pfizer told us:Pfizer‚Äôs protease inhibitor is not similar to that of an animal medicine and is not the same mechanism. In the past, protease inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of HIV and Hepatitis C. Applying this powerful and potent mechanism of action to COVID-19 could alter the course of the pandemic. For COVID-19, protease inhibitors are designed to block the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 protease, which is an enzyme the virus needs to multiply and replicate itself in the body, and as a result, stop symptoms from worsening.Dr. Stephen Griffin, a virologist and associate professor at Leeds Institute of Medical Research, told Full Fact that Pfizer's new drug was ""nothing like"" ivermectin, and that the two drugs were ""extremely structurally different.""Pfizer is currently conducting trials on a new oral drug, currently known as PF-07321332, to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The company said in a statement that the ""novel oral antiviral candidate PF-07321332"" would be co-administered with a ""low dose of ritonavir,"" another antiretroviral protease inhibitor, to prevent COVID-19 infections.Pfizer said in a statement: ""Protease inhibitors, like PF-07321332, are designed to block the activity of the main protease enzyme that the coronavirus needs to replicate.""Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's chief scientific officer and president for Worldwide Research, Development, said:"	false
4662	U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it's dangerous to let voters decide President Donald Trump's fate in the 2020 election.	"In late November 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump posted an inaccurate, late-night tweet in which he accused U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of stating that, ""It is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump‚Äôs fate.""Nancy Pelosi just stated that ‚Äúit is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump‚Äôs fate.‚Äù @FoxNews In other words, she thinks I‚Äôm going to win and doesn‚Äôt want to take a chance on letting the voters decide.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2019Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives are leading an impeachment inquiry against Trump based on whistleblower allegations that he attempted to extort the Ukrainian president by withholding crucial military aid while he pressed for dirt on a political rival. Trump has defended himself by characterizing impeachment proceedings as a political ""witch hunt.""Pelosi never made the remark quoted in Trump's tweet, however. The words that Trump put in quotation marks and attributed to her were actually made by Fox News host Mike Emanuel.Emanuel said, ""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulating a memo to Democrats tonight, telling them it would be dangerous to let voters decide President Trump's fate when it comes to the Ukraine investigation."" Emanuel made the comment during the Fox News program ""Fox News @ Night,"" which airs between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Trump's tweet was posted shortly after the program aired.The memo that Pelosi sent doesn't state that it would be dangerous to let voters decide Trump's fate in office. Her exact statement reads as follows:The facts are uncontested: that the President abused his power for his own personal, political benefit, at the expense of our national security interests.The weak response to these hearings has been, ‚ÄúLet the election decide.‚Äù That dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.It concludes, ""None of us comes to Congress to impeach a President, but rather to make progress for America‚Äôs working families. However, our first order of business is our oath to support and defend the Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic. As such, we are custodians of the Constitution and, For The People, defenders of our democracy.""Pelosi sees the upcoming 2020 election and the House impeachment inquiry separately. Her statement was a reflection of previous comments in which she has said legislators in Congress are duty-bound by the Constitution to move forward with impeachment proceedings, rather than dropping them simply because a presidential election is one year away. As the Washington Post reported, Pelosi made this distinction during a recent news conference:During an Oct. 17 [2019] news conference, a reporter asked Pelosi ‚Äúhow important is it for impeachment to bleed over into an election year?‚ÄùPelosi responded that ‚Äúimpeachment is about the truth and the Constitution,‚Äù whereas elections should deal instead with policy issues like gun control and climate change. ‚ÄúThat has nothing to do with what is happening in terms of our honoring our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution and the facts that might support,‚Äù Pelosi said.Pressing Pelosi, the reporter asked: ‚ÄúAt what point might you say, let‚Äôs just let the voters decide?‚Äù‚ÄúNo, no.

3025	President Joe Biden's climate plan includes cutting 90% of red meat from Americans' diets by 2030.	"Biden announced that his administration would seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. The Daily Mail ran a story that asserted, in entirely theoretical terms, that the policy ""could"" require Americans to reduce their meat consumption by 90%. Politicians like Rep. Lauren Boebert retweeted the Daily Mail's speculation as fact. On April 22, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden gave remarks at the ""Virtual Leaders Summit on Climate"" in which he framed a nationwide effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions as an opportunity for ""millions of good-paying, middle-class, union jobs."" By investing in these new jobs, Biden said, he hopes the United States can cut its greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030:¬† ¬†The United States isn‚Äôt waiting.¬† We are resolving to take action ‚Äî not only the ‚Äî our federal government, but our cities and our states all across our country; small businesses, large businesses, large corporations; American workers in every field.I see an opportunity to create millions of good-paying, middle-class, union jobs.¬† I see line workers laying thousands of miles of transmission lines for a clean, modern, resilient grid.¬† I see workers capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up, and abandoned coal mines that need to be reclaimed, putting a stop to the methane leaks and protecting the health of our communities.I see auto workers building the next generation of electric vehicles, and electricians installing nationwide for 500,000 charging stations along our highways. I see ‚Ä¶ engineers and the construction workers building new carbon capture and green hydrogen plants to forge cleaner steel and cement and produce clean power.¬† I see farmers deploying cutting-edge tools to make soil of our ‚Äî of our Heartland the next frontier in carbon innovation.By maintaining those investments and putting these people to work, the United States sets out on the road to cut greenhouse gases in half ‚Äî in half by the end of this decade.¬† That‚Äôs where we‚Äôre headed as a nation, and that‚Äôs what we can do if we take action to build an economy that‚Äôs not only more prosperous, but healthier, fairer, and cleaner for the entire planet.At no point in this speech did Biden announce any initiative to impose a limit on red meat consumption. At no point in his presidency has Biden suggested policies aimed at limiting red meat consumption.Despite these facts, right-wing news outlets and politicians began aggressively repeating the claim that Biden's plan included ""cutting 90% of red meat from our diets by 2030."" This false notion stems from the British tabloid the Daily Mail, which ‚Äî in lieu of actual details the Biden administration has not yet provided ‚Äî took it upon themselves to speculate about what terrible things ""could"" be theoretically included in the plan:The Daily Mail cited a report published by the University of Michigan Center for Sustainable Systems that looked, in extremely simplified terms, how much of a reduction would result from various dietary changes. As reported by the Center for Biological Diversity, the researchers concluded:That replacing half of all animal-based foods with plant-based alternatives would reduce diet-related emissions by 35%. And if half of all animal-based foods were replaced with plant-based alternatives and beef consumption fell by 90%, dietary emissions would drop by 51%. If American diets remain unchanged, emissions associated with producing the food we eat will climb 9% by 2030.The University of Michigan exercise is, in their words, ""reliant on a number of simplifying assumptions"" and designed to show the impact of various diet change scenarios on climate. It is not, in any way, a policy suggestion or proposal. As you may recall, the Biden announcement was about green jobs and did not once mention initiatives to change the diet of Americans. Despite this, Biden's critics used the Daily Mail's baseless speculation as if it were actual scientific analysis of a plan whose details Biden has not yet released.Former Fox News pundit Todd Starnes argued on his show that the January 2020 Michigan study was actually an analysis of a Biden plan that, at the time of this reporting in April 2021, has not been released:The claim that Biden's plan includes this 90% red meat reduction is often paired with a Fox News screen capture:As it is clear by the citation, this information comes from the same University of Michigan study the Daily Mail relied on to speculate about potential paths to carbon emission reductions. It is not, as suggested, a ""requirement"" for Biden's climate plan. Fox's reporting made it all the way to the halls of Congress. On April 24, 2021, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., asserted in a viral tweet that the Daily Mail's speculation was an actual policy proposal by Biden:"	false
4164	All businesses in the U.S. are required to accept coins and/or currency as payment.	"In July 2020, Mississippi state Sen. Chad McMahan posted a warning to businesses in his state that were declining to handle cash during the COVID-19 pandemic (due to fears of virus transmission via surface contact) that they were breaking the law by refusing to accept payment in legal tender:
Notice to businesses not accepting cash, Legal Tender, in Mississippi.  I've had several people reach out to me about an issue taking place in our state. Scott, thank you for the email.It is my understanding several companies in Mississippi are refusing to take cash as payment.Take a look at the photos attached. This is a Federal Reserve Note, a $20 bill. This paper money, this note, is Legal Tender for all debts, public and private.Business owners, if you refused to take cash, the debt is paid in full.   If you are a business owner and you refuse to take cash, you are breaking the law.Here is an example, if I stop by your store and I purchase $44 worth of fuel, and I try to pay you with a $100 bill and you refuse payment of cash, the debt is paid in full. There is nothing you can do to prosecute me because you have refused payment of Legal Tender, unless the business suspects counterfeit bills.I'm asking residents of Mississippi to make me aware of companies who will not receive or take your cash. They will be receiving a call from my office, the Department of Revenue, and the Attorney General's office.
McMahan was wrong in a legal sense, however: No federal law requires all businesses in the U.S. to accept currency or coins as payment for goods and services.The designation of coins and/or currency as ""legal tender"" does not mean that all merchants must accept that form of payment for all transactions.  In short, when a debt has been incurred by one party to another, and the parties have agreed that cash is to be the medium of exchange, then legal tender must be accepted if it is proffered in satisfaction of that debt.  However, otherwise the selling party may set the medium of exchange to be anything they choose: dollars, bananas, precious gems, feathers, whiskey, etc.  They may also choose to accept cash payment only via alternative forms (e.g., credit/debit card, check, money order) rather than currency itself.    The U.S. Treasury answers this question of legal tender acceptability on their website thusly:
Q: I thought that United States currency was legal tender for all debts. Some businesses or governmental agencies say that they will only accept checks, money orders or credit cards as payment, and others will only accept currency notes in denominations of $20 or smaller. Isn't this illegal?A: The pertinent portion of law that applies to your question is the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled ""Legal tender,"" which states: ""United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.""This statute means that all United States money as identified above are a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor. There is, however, no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy.
As noted above, however, although no federal regulation requires businesses to accept currency and coins as payment, local regulations may do so. Massachusetts has had such a law in place since 1978, and New Jersey enacted similar legislation in 2019. A few cities (e.g., San Francisco, Philadelphia) have prohibited stores from going cashless as well.  "	false

1892	"Fake ""Time"" magazine covers featuring Donald Trump were found at several of his golf resorts."	"On 27 June 2017, the Washington Postpublished an article about decor at four of President Donald Trump's golf resorts. It revealed that the resorts contained bogus magazine covers made up to look like issues of Time, featuring Trump on the cover and promoting his reality television show ""The Apprentice"":
It is not clear who created this fake Time cover ‚Äî or why.Its date might be a clue: March 1, 2009, was the season debut of Trump‚Äôs show ‚ÄúThe Celebrity Apprentice.‚Äù But a transcript of that show offers no answers. In that episode, various B-list celebrities competed to sell cupcakes, and Trump fired comedian Andrew Dice Clay for poor performance. Nobody mentioned Time magazine.While it‚Äôs not difficult to mock up a fake cover using graphic-design software, whoever made this one sought out real Time headlines, to add to the fake.
The faux covers were dated 1 March 2009 (the same day ""The Apprentice"" premiered), but as the Washington Post article noted, the magazine did not publish an issue on that date. However, it did publish an issue a day later with actress Kate Winslet on the cover which did not mention Trump at all.Two of the headlines used in the actual 2 March 2009 issue of Time (""How Stressed Is Your Bank? A Checkup"" and ""Obama's Next Move: Can He Curb Health Care Costs?"") appeared on¬†the mocked-up cover, which was spotted on display in Trump resorts in Colorado, New York, New Jersey, Virginia and his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida among others. Employees at the Turnberry resort in Scotland also reported that the cover had been displayed there until they took it down¬†because of ""grumbling about all the stuff like that up on the walls"" by American tourists. The Washington Post, which published the story, later reported that it was also taken down from Trump's golf course in Ireland.The fake magazine cover included a fake bar code which was used in a graphic design tutorial posted by graphic designer Leonardo Amoretti on his blog in 2010, which also displayed a mockup of a ""Time"" cover:Amoretti noted in his post that ""The use of TIME magazine logo on this tutorial is just for instructional purposes and not intended to violate the magazine copyrights.""A spokesperson for the magazine said that it had requested the removal of the faux Time covers from display at Trump resorts."	true

It did not mention, or even allude to, any specific ongoing medical case, including that of Alfie Evans.Evans died on 28 April 2018, just short of his second birthday.

By the following day, a rumor was afloat in social media that President Trump's ""team"" had begun deleting tweets in which Trump, like the shooting suspect, had referred to immigrants as ""invaders"": In light of El Paso and Dayton and the focus on white nationalist rhetoric, Trump's team has appeared to delete tweets where he used ""invaders"" to describe immigrants. This is a violation of the The Presidential Records Act of 1978 (44 USC ¬ß¬ß 2201‚Äì2207). #daytonshooter pic.twitter.com/OP8QgHUq2k‚Äî Amee Vanderpool (@girlsreallyrule) August 4, 2019 However, at the time that rumor was posted, the three tweets it referenced as examples (one of which had nothing to do with immigrants) were still openly accessible in Trump's Twitter feed (and remained so at the time of this writing):We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country.

5957	The Environmental Protection Agency will ban manmade snow after dihydrogen monoxide was found.	"On 31 March 2018, Snowriders Australia, a web site dedicated to ski and snowboarding enthusiasts, posted a story reporting the Environmental Protection Agency will ban manufactured snow after scientists discovered it ""contains high concentrations"" of di-hydrogen monoxide (DHMO):Widespread but little known, DHMO is lethal when inhaled, corrodes metal and may form blistering vapours when heated.‚ÄúThese findings are extremely alarming‚Äù, said University spokesman, Dr Alan Rainmaker. ‚ÄúThe use of DHMO ‚Äì which consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom ‚Äì is unfortunately commonplace in the snow-sports industry, with some resorts using concentrations as high as 100%‚Äù.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no wonder people‚Äôs edges rust during the off season‚Äù, he added.The story is an apparent April Fool's prank playing on a long-running hoax. But some readers expressed concern about encountering ""lethal"" DHMO while enjoying winter sports. However, dihydrogen monoxide is H2O ‚Äî in other words,¬†water.¬†¬†The hoax has been fooling people for years. In 2004, city officials in Aliso Viejo, an affluent city in Orange County, California nearly banned foam cups after falling for it and learning DHMO was used in the manufacturing process from a prank web site, DHMO.org (a careful inspection reveals a small disclaimer, ""Content veracity not implied"" at the bottom of the site)."	false
1369	A contestant on the game show Press Your Luck racked up an amazing series of wins by memorizing the patterns of the prize board's sequence of lights.	"¬†In 1984, an Ohio man put together an astounding run on the television game show Press Your Luck. He did so by memorizing the sequences by which the various prize squares lit up on the game board, allowing him to time his button presses to coincide with the lights' stopping on the most advantageous squares. By hitting 35 such squares in a row, he was able to accumulate the largest win in the history of that show, and he did it all in under an hour. When the effort became too fatiguing, he passed his remaining spins to another contestant rather than risk losing his accumulated winnings to a mistimed press of the plunger.Michael Paul Larson came by the idea after speculating that the ""whammies"" (the nickname given to the turn-ending prize-gobbling brown monsters that would at times pop up in squares hit by the contestant) might be appearing only in certain positions on the board and therefore could be completely avoided by someone who had memorized the patterns of their appearances. He began videotaping the show to see if the lights moved randomly. Almost immediately, he found that they did not move randomly, and he discovered that certain three-square sequences were repeated again and again. He deduced there was some commonality to these repetitions, and after an additional six weeks of study he realized that the board utilized only six patterns, each consisting of a fixed sequence of eighteen numbers. After that, it was but a matter of memorizing those six patterns, then getting on the show.As a contestant, Larson gained control of the board by answering a question correctly, then began landing on a sequence of prize squares that provided him with $3,000, $4,000, or $5,000, as well as another spin. By hitting these types of squares again and again, he held control of the board for 35 spins, racking up a total of $110,237 before finally relinquishing his turn to someone else.Game show officials were quick to figure out something wasn't quite kosher when Larson sped from one high cash square to another with nary a whammy coming into sight, yet they were helpless to end Larson's streak because he wasn't doing anything illegal. Whatever special knowledge Larson had, it didn't amount to cheating. Once he was off the show, the board was recalibrated, and the show moved to set a $75,000 limit on winnings.As for how this story ended, Larson ran through his game show gains in less than two years and afterwards became an assistant manager at a local WalMart.¬†"	true
796	"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention increased what it considers the ""lethal exposure"" threshold of vinyl chloride, a toxic chemical released due to the February 2023 Ohio train derailment, mere days or weeks before the incident."	"On Feb. 9, 2023, the CDC announced it was seeking public comment on draft updates of the toxicological profiles for four different chemicals ‚Äî cobalt, hexachlorocyclohexane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and vinyl chloride ‚Äî all of which took months to prepare and all of which were completed, in draft form, in January 2023. The timing of the release of the draft profile updates was unconnected to the Ohio train derailment, and, contrary to rumor, the update for vinyl chloride did not drastically raise its ""lethal exposure"" level. Major disasters often spawn conspiracy theories, and the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in February 2023 proved no exception.In the aftermath of that incident, even as authorities labored to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of the release of¬†vinyl chloride¬†and other hazardous substances into the atmosphere, fringe news websites and social media accounts began raising alarms over the timing of what they termed a ""suspicious"" update to the toxicological profile of vinyl chloride on the website of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).¬†The premise of this conspiracy theory was that the CDC had suddenly and inexplicably, just days before the Ohio train derailment, revised the information about vinyl chloride on its website to indicate the chemical is far less toxic than previously stated. But while it's true that the CDC updated information about vinyl chloride on its website around the date of the accident, those updates did not drastically reevaluate the toxicity of vinyl chloride, nor was there anything sudden, inexplicable, or suspicious about the timing.¬†The derailment occurred on Feb. 3, 2023. To forestall a likely explosion, authorities initiated a controlled release and burn-off of the hazardous chemicals on the train on Feb. 6, which sent a massive¬†plume of black smoke into the atmosphere. Confusion reigned in the days to follow, as local residents watched the sky, drank bottled water, and feared for their lives, while government health officials repeated assurances that they had found no evidence of dangerous levels of chemicals in the air or water.¬†On or about Feb. 15, rumors began to spread on social media that the CDC had suddenly and unaccountably revised its guidance on what constitutes a dangerous level of vinyl chloride, and that it had done so just 11 days before the East Palestine train crash:¬†The claim became¬†more specific as it made the rounds. ""The update changes the lethal exposure from 100PPM to 100,000PPM,"" said one tweet. ""What are the odds?""¬†On Feb. 17, the conspiracy theory-friendly website News Punch published an article entitled ""'Inside Job': CDC Changed Toxicity Info on Vinyl Chloride Days Before Derailment.""It claimed that:¬†The CDC edited the toxicology profile for vinyl chloride, massively increasing the lethal exposure level and removing information about how the chemical affects children, just two weeks before the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio that spewed vast quantities of the chemical into the environment.¬†The CDC update changed the lethal exposure from 100PPM to 100,000PPM. The lethal exposure level had remained the same for 17 years before the CDC decided to update the number just prior to the derailment, where highly toxic chemicals spilled or were burned off, leaving a chemical stench in the air nearly two weeks later.[ ... ]Evie Magazine report: In January 2023, the toxicological profile for vinyl chloride was revised from the original guidelines published in the Federal Register nearly four decades ago ‚Äì on April 17, 1987, to be exact. While toxicological profiles are updated occasionally, users are alarmed by the odd timing.¬†On Feb. 9, 2023, the CDC added a link on its website to a draft of an updated version¬†of its existing Toxicological Profile for Vinyl Chloride, which had¬†been in effect since a previous update in 2006 (not four decades ago, as claimed). As noted on the access page for the updated profile, this was not a final draft. It was posted for the purpose of gathering public comment (comment period to end May 10, 2023) before completion. According to the¬†Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR, the CDC agency charged with assessing the toxicity of substances),¬†toxicological profiles are peer-reviewed summaries of published findings in the scientific literature about specific chemicals of concern.¬†""The toxicological profiles include an examination, summary, and interpretation of available toxicological and epidemiologic information on substances.""¬†Profiles are evaluated annually to determine whether updating is necessary.¬†FACT: There was nothing odd, suspicious, or sinister about the timing of this update. Three other draft toxicological profiles were released the same day.¬†An announcement and updates related to the draft toxicological profile were posted on the CDC website on Feb. 9, six days after the East Palestine train derailment, and three days after the controlled release of vinyl chloride. The PDF file of the draft toxicological profile was created in January, mere weeks or days before the derailment occurred. Was there anything odd or uncanny about this? Quite the opposite.¬†The vinyl chloride update was just one of four such updates announced by the CDC on the same day (Feb. 9).¬†In each case, existing website copy was revised and a link was added to a draft profile of the relevant substance dated January 2023. According to ATSDR, toxicological profiles can take more than a year to update, so revising the profile for vinyl chloride was not a sudden, last-minute undertaking.The four simultaneous profile releases were also announced in the Feb. 9, 2023, Federal Register:¬†DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry[Docket No. ATSDR‚Äì2022‚Äì0006]Availability of Four Draft Toxicological ProfilesAGENCY: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).ACTION: Notice with comment period.SUMMARY: The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the opening of a docket to obtain comments on drafts of four updated toxicological profiles: Cobalt, Hexachlorocyclohexanes, 1,1,1-Trichloroethane, and Vinyl Chloride.DATES: Written comments must be received on or before May 10, 2023.¬†We note, first, that the phrase ""lethal exposure level"" is nowhere to be found in either the existing (2006) profile¬†or the 2023 draft profile.¬†Nor did we find an instance wherein an exposure level deemed lethal at 100 ppm (parts per million) in 2006 was raised to 100,000 ppm in 2023. In fact, the only statement along these lines we did encounter appeared in both versions in almost identical form:¬†2007:Brief exposures to concentrations of vinyl chloride ranging from 100,000 to 400,000 ppm have been shown to be fatal in experimental animals such as rats (Lester et al. 1963; Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Prodan et al. 1975), guinea pigs (Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Patty et al. 1930; Prodan et al. 1975), mice (Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Prodan et al. 1975), and rabbits (Prodan et al. 1975). At these concentrations, deaths occurred within 30‚Äì60 minutes. Male mice exposed to 30,000 ppm vinyl chloride 6 hours/day for 5 days, in a dominant lethal study showed an increased mortality rate (Anderson et al. 1976). An
increased mortality rate was also observed at much lower concentrations in maternal mice in a developmental toxicity study (John et al. 1977, 1981). In this study, maternal mice had an increased incidence of deaths following exposure to 500 ppm for 10 days during gestation.¬†¬†2023:¬†Brief exposures to concentrations of vinyl chloride ranging from 100,000 to 400,000 ppm have been shown to be fatal in rats (Lester et al. 1963; Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Prodan et
al. 1975), guinea pigs (Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Patty et al. 1930; Prodan et al. 1975), mice (Mastromatteo et al. 1960; Prodan et al. 1975), and rabbits (Prodan et al. 1975). At these concentrations, deaths occurred within 30‚Äì60 minutes. An increased mortality rate was also observed at much lower
concentrations in maternal mice in a developmental toxicity study (John et al. 1977, 1981). In this study, mortality was observed following exposure to 500 ppm for 10 days during gestation.In short, the revised information about vinyl chloride was part of the planned release by the CDC of four draft toxicological profiles, all dated January 2023, for public comment; the proximity of that release to the date of the Ohio train derailment was coincidental; and the 2023 draft profile for vinyl chloride does not contain a dramatic increase in the level of exposure to the chemical that is considered lethal.¬†Snopes contacted the CDC for comment and received the following response via email, quoted here in full:¬†Thank you for reaching out to CDC on this request.By Congressional mandate, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) produces and updates toxicological profiles (Tox Profiles) for chemical substances found on its Substance Priority List (SPL) at National Priorities List (NPL) sites. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA or Superfund), further requires that toxicological profiles be updated periodically. ¬†ATSDR evaluates profiles annually to determine whether updating is necessary. Depending on the complexity of the chemical, the process for developing a Tox Profile can take up to a year or more. This includes multiple reviews, such as external, independent peer review followed by release for a 90-day public comment period, and incorporating any necessary changes and final publishing.ATSDR developed the initial vinyl chloride Tox Profile in 1989 and produced updates in 1993, 1997, 2006, and 2023 based on the latest information published in the scientific literature.ATSDR has been working on an update to the Vinyl Chloride Tox Profile over the past year, and made it available for public comment on 2/9/2023 as part of its usual process and not related to the emergent situation in East Palestine. The draft Tox Profile is available for public comment until May 20, 2023. It updates the 2006 version with the most recent information."	false
2364	During a December 2021 speech at a Turning Point USA conference, Fox News host Jesse Watters called for the assassination of Dr. Anthony Fauci.	"Speaking about Fauci during a December 2021 speech, Watters said: ""Now you're going for the kill shot. The kill shot with an ambush, deadly. Because he doesn't see it coming."" However, contrary to how some commentators interpreted these remarks, Watters was instructing his audience on how to confront Fauci with questions in order to get viral clips for Fox News. Despite using violent language to convey his message (i.e., ""ambush,"" ""kill shot,"" and ""Boom. He's dead."") the context of Watters' remarks does not support the allegation that he literally urged people to kill Fauci.On Dec. 20, 2021, a brief clip of Fox News host Jesse Watters speaking about Dr. Anthony Fauci, U.S. President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, at a Turning Point USA conference went viral on social media. In the clip, Watters can be heard saying ""Now you go in with the kill shot -- deadly. Because, with an ambush, he doesn‚Äôt see it coming.""As this video circulated online, many people commented that Watters should be arrested or fired for supposedly encouraging violence against Fauci. Some even claimed that Watters had called for Fauci's ""assassination"":While this clip is real, and while Watters certainly used inappropriately violent language, this clip is missing context. Watters made this comment while instructing the audience on how best to verbally confront Fauci in public in order to generate viral clips for Fox News.¬†Watters comment can be heard around the 2:24:00 minute mark of the following video. We've transcribed the relevant portions below:Watters said:""Let's pretend this podium is Fauci. It's about the same size. You gotta ambush a guy like Fauci. This is how you do these ambushes like [conservative activist and Project Veritas founder James] O'Keefe. You've gotta be respectful. Because they'll turn the tables on you and you can't have it blow up in your face. So if you see Fauci out and about and you know he's coming to town this is how you approach.""Watters then talked about various tactics people could use to confront Fauci in public. He instructed the audience to introduce themselves, to accuse Fauci of lying about his research (a generally false statement), to wave a blank sheet of paper in Fauci's face, falsely claiming that it's a research grant, and then to go in with what he described as the ""kill shot"" question:¬†So now he's in trouble. Now you're going for the kill shot. The kill shot with an ambush, deadly. Because he doesn't see it coming. This is when you say. 'Dr. Fauci, you funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese lab. The same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world. You know why people don't trust you, don't you?'Booooooom. He's dead. He's done. Now you do that, 30 seconds, that's all you need. Now you get that footage to us .... Imagine Tucker Carlson teases out of the block ""coming up, brave college student confronts lord Fauci at dinner. Exclusive footage."" Get us that. That's what we want.Watters does appear to be instructing people to verbally harass Fauci, and he did use violent, irresponsible language -- words such as ""ambush"" and ""kill shot"" -- during these remarks. However, he was not telling the crowd to assassinate Fauci. He was saying to ""ambush"" Fauci with questions.While Watters did not literally call for Fauci's assassination, as some claimed on social media, the loaded language he used while calling on the public to confront Fauci left many people concerned for Fauci's safety. On CNN, Fauci said that Watters' comments were awful, and that Watters should be fired.¬†"	false

4365	Plainclothes New York City police officers wear colored arm bands to identify themselves to other police officers.	"In late May and early June of 2020, following the death of an unarmed black man named George Floyd while pinned to the ground by a white Minneapolis police officer, demonstrations against police violence toward black citizens drew massive crowds in several major cities. These events drew attention not only to systemic problems in American policing, but also to police tactics used for crowd control or riots. One such observation, made in a Twitter post that went viral, was that non-uniformed NYPD police officers involved in arresting protesters wore white arm bands:First, a clarification. The individuals shown above are not technically ‚Äúundercover cops.‚Äù They are, instead, plainclothes police officers. In addition to their arm bands, they also have visible police body cameras and handcuffs in their back pockets, along with other fairly obvious indications of their status as law enforcement officers. In other words, plainclothes officers are equipped with the same basic equipment a uniformed patrol officer would have, but do not conspicuously advertise their affiliation to the police with a uniform. Undercover police officers, on the other hand, would take active steps to fully conceal their connection to law enforcement.However, the claim that NYPD plainclothes police officers use arm bands to identify themselves is entirely factual. Known as the ‚Äúcolor of the day‚Äù system, it was first introduced in 1971 by the NYPD‚Äôs street crime unit. Because these plainclothes officers were armed and placed in positions that attracted muggings or similar crimes in public places, the NYPD was concerned about uniformed officers shooting the plainclothes officers working this job. The solution, as described in a 1979 history of the street crime unit, was colored arm bands:""Elastic armbands are issued to each street crime unit member, with a color of the day being determined and relayed over the department teletype network to all commands and law enforcement agencies.""Currently, the color of the day system applies to all NYPD plainclothes officers, and is a required part of the job, regardless of the presence of large demonstrations or protests, as stated in a 2017 NYPD patrol officer‚Äôs manual. The color, the manual states, can be displayed as an arm band or a headband (emphasis ours):""Uniformed members of the service assigned to civilian clothed enforcement duties are required to have their service 9MM semi-automatic pistol and one extra fully loaded magazine or their service .38 caliber revolver with twelve extra cartridges, handcuffs with key, ... and the 'color of the day' head/arm band on their persons.""The tweet that went viral showed plainclothes NYPD officers wearing white arm bands, but the color, as previously mentioned, changes day by day. Here is a video taken of plainclothes officers from a day when the color was orange:"	true
2614	A photograph shows a mountain resembling a human looking up into the sky.	"A photograph supposedly showing a mountain resembling a face looking up into the sky is frequently met with comments as it circulates on social media.¬†While it is sometimes mislabeled as if it shows a mountain in Morocco, Africa (such as in the above-displayed example), this is a genuine photograph of a mountain that resembles a face. This unique landscape can be seen near the city of Antequera in the province of M√°laga in Spain.¬†This photograph was taken by Miguel Morenatti, a travel photographer, and shows the Pe√±a de los Enamorados (or ""The Lovers' Rock""). This mountain is also referred to as Monta√±a del Indio (or Indian Mountain). In Morenatti's 2018 Instagram post, it is called ""Indio de Antequera"" (or the ""Indian of Antequera."")Morenatti also stated on Instagram that this picture is ""not photoshop."" The photographer said that it was all about finding the right perspective to make it appear as if the mountain also had a head of hair from the tree branches. Morenatti said:¬†No, no es photoshop! Solo he girado la foto y buscado la perspectiva adecuada. Indio de Antequera.No, it is not photoshop! I have just rotated the photo and searched for the right perspective. Indian of Antequera.Here are some other pictures of the Indian of Antequera.Andalucia.org, the official tourism site of the Andalusia region of Spain, explains the legend behind the rock's name, writing that this unique mountain received the name Pe√±a de los Enamorados (""Lover's Rock"") after two forbidden lovers jumped to their deaths to avoid persecution.¬†The profile of the Pe√±a de los Enamorados is very unusual because it looks like a human's face lying down on the ground, facing the sky. The explanation for this peculiar silhouette on the town's horizon comes from a legend with the same name, inspired by the Middle Ages and known especially thanks to the stories from the Spanish Golden Age.Legend has it that Tello, a Christian who was captive in Granada, fell in love with a beautiful woman of Archidona, called Tagzona. Their love was so strong that they decided to escape to the Christian lands of Antequera. As they were on their way, the girl's father discovered them and he sent his bowmen to stop them. The two lovers climbed up the mountain that lies halfway between Archidona and Antequera, and as they saw they were going to be caught, they decided that they preferred to die together than to live apart. So they held onto each other and jumped from the top of the mountain. And since then this place has been called ""The Lovers' Rock"". ‚ÄúFrom the craggy rock they jumped and in the air they left their souls‚Äù (Carvajal y Robles)."	true

Could this advert be released today?The date attached to the claim does not match up with WD-40's actual timeline, though: The product was made commercially available in San Diego in 1958, eight years before this purported ad supposedly promoted the product's ""first release"":A few years following WD-40's first industrial use, Rocket Chemical Company founder Norm Larsen experimented with putting WD-40 into aerosol cans, reasoning that consumers might find a use for the product at home as some of the employees had. The product made its first appearance on store shelves in San Diego in 1958.¬†In addition to the questionable date associated with the image, there are several aspects of the advertisement that ring false. First, this is the only image available on the Internet showing the notable WD-40 ad; if the ad were genuine, there should be more than one photograph documenting its existence. Second, aspects of this image suggest it isn't a photograph at all: While the paper advertisement appears old and crinkled, the lettering remains straight, indicating the text is probably nothing more than a digital overlay placed onto an ""old wrinkled page"" background image. Finally, the image describes the product as ""WD 40"" when its name is, and always had been, properly rendered as WD-40 (or WD*40), and it makes reference to a ""red knob"" that wasn't yet a feature of the product (the distinctive red cap that now tops cans of WD-40 was originally black)."	false
1757	Law enforcement officials alerted the public to check the tops of commercially sold bottles of water for tampering because someone is injecting poison into them.	"In March 2018, we began receiving inquiries from readers about an alert spreading on social media saying that several people had died after drinking bottled water purposely injected with poison.The minute amount of information provided was vague and unsourced. A post shared via both Facebook and Twitter said the deaths had occurred in ""the Richmond area"" (no state specified), and that the announcement had been made by the local sheriff:Some of you may not have heard so please pass along! Terrifying ?#tamperedwater #poisonwaterbottles #contaminatedwater pic.twitter.com/ubWykz2PXa‚Äî Morgan (@TheWildFlower9) March 19, 2018The same message was shared in texts and e-mails:Enforcement and Government Officials are asking all to check the tops of every purchased water bottle because someone is going around injecting poison into the tops of water. It's being done so that you do not recognize that the bottle has been tampered with.. You have to turn the bottle upside down and squeeze before opening it. If it leaks throw it away. A few people have already died in the Richmond area.. the Sheriff just made the announcement.Readers who alerted us to the rumor assumed that the ""Richmond"" mentioned in the message was either in California or Virginia. The Richmond, California Police Department told us they were unaware of any such incidents; the Richmond, Virginia Sheriff's Office didn't get back to us. In any case, we found no press reports of water bottle tampering or poisoning in either location, much less people dying as a result of such activities. Neither did we find press reports of a law enforcement announcement in that regard.Had such incidents actually occurred they would have garnered national media attention. Tampering with consumer products with reckless disregard or intent to harm is a federal crime that carries especially stiff penalties in cases that result in serious bodily injury or death.Its timing suggests that the rumor may have started as a riff on a 3 March 2018 Facebook post purporting to offer photographic proof that the caps of nearly all of the bottles of water in a shrink-wrapped package purchased at in Bennington, Vermont had been pierced with a pin, needle, or similar sharp object:A video attached to the above post has since reappeared in messages by other users claiming that the water was purchased elsewhere in the United States (South Carolina, for example).As a number of Facebook commenters observed after viewing the video (see below), the outside packaging shows no evident signs of being punctured. They also pointed out that the shrink wrap had already been torn open when the footage begins, and there are no apparent signs of water leakage inside it.Possible explanations for the punctured caps include a manufacturing mistake of some kind, tampering prior to the bottles being packaged, or tampering by the purchaser after the package was opened.¬†The author of the original Facebook post has repeatedly insisted that the video accurately documents the condition in which the product was found. She also says the incident was reported to the Walmart store where the water was purchased. A customer service representative at the Walmart Superstore in Bennington told us she was unaware of any such reports.On 22 March the Bennington Police Department issued a statement saying the incident had been reported to them and an active investigation was underway. The statement noted that the both the customer and the staff at the Walmart store were cooperating, and that the latter had been ""diligent in their effort to ensure the water at the store is safe to sell to consumers."" It also revealed that a month had passed between the time the water bottles were purchased and the holes were first noticed by the customer. Two persons had consumed some of the water but did not get sick or suffer any ill effects.""Currently, there does not appear to be any danger to the public,"" the statement said. There have been no subsequent press releases on the case.Regardless of what caused the pinpricks (and we may never know), speculation about their origin gave way to speculation about how the bottles' contents could have been adulterated. Some people suggested a biological contaminant such as a virus could have been injected into the water:The host of a YouTube video uploaded on 19 March (and since deleted) suggested that the bottles could have had poison injected into them. In keeping with the time-honored process of rumor formation, what started as a speculative notion went on to be shared and repeated by others as established fact."	false
