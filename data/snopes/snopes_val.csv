6151	President Trump has proposed defunding NASA’s interest in the International Space Station to allow for commercial development of the asset.	"On 11 February 2018, the Washington Post reported on what it described as an ""internal NASA document"" reporters had obtained. The documents apparently lay out plans to end funding for the station by 2025 for a possible handover to private commercial entities, though they do not set out any specific plans to accomplish that goal:The Trump administration wants to turn the International Space Station into a kind of orbiting real estate venture run not by the government, but by private industry.The White House plans to stop funding the station after 2024, ending direct federal support of the orbiting laboratory. But it does not intend to abandon the orbiting laboratory altogether and is working on a transition plan that could turn the station over to the private sector, according to an internal NASA document obtained by The Washington Post.[...]The internal NASA document has scant details over how the privatization of the station would work. As it prepares a transition plan, the White House said it “will request market analysis and business plans from the commercial sector and solicit plans from commercial industry.”While the suggestion of a Trump-branded real estate venture in low-Earth orbit evoked by this article’s intro may be a bit of an oversell, Trump's proposed budget — which was released the next day — did include provisions to end funding for the ISS, and to support ventures that could lead to its privatization:The Budget proposes to end direct U.S. Government funding for the space station by 2025 and provides $150 million to begin a program that would encourage commercial development of capabilities that NASA can use in its place.What to do with the International Space Station at the conclusion of its mission has long been a topic of discussion. First established in 1998 with a planned fifteen-year lifespan, it has been an international collaboration organized by NASA with involvement from many nations including Russia, Japan, the European Space Agency, Canada, and Brazil, and it includes modules or experiments by these and other nations.A 2014 NASA Inspector General report estimated that the station will cost around 3 to 4 billion dollars a year to maintain safely moving forward, and that the life of the station could plausibly be extended to 2024 if specific safety concerns were addressed:We found that while NASA has identified no major obstacles to extending ISS operations to 2024, it must address several areas of risk to ensure continued safe operations. In addition, NASA projects its annual budget for the ISS Program to grow from $3 billion in FY 2014 to nearly $4 billion by FY 2020. However, with a 26 percent cost increase between FYs 2011 and 2013 and an average increase of 8 percent annually over the life of the Program, we believe the assumptions underlying NASA’s cost projections are overly optimistic and result in an understated projection of out-year expenses.A complicating factor, outside the more than $75 billion the United States has already invested in the station, is that there is currently no established plan for how to conclude operations on the ISS, which if left unattended would partially burn up in an uncontrolled fall through Earth’s atmosphere at some point— potentially causing harm on the ground.Russia, the largest non-United States stakeholder in the station, had been working to develop a new core for a future Russian space station that would be able to make use of the existing Russian modules already present on the station without destroying them through a de-orbit. However, since 2017, the Russian space program has said that they consider such an idea unfeasible, reiterating a desire to maintain the ISS with its partner nations.According to the document obtained by the Post, the Trump administration has no plans to de-orbit the station, either; their hope is evidently that selling the station to private funders will allow for the station to remain safely in orbit. Privatizing the ISS has long been proposed as a potential solution to the station’s future funding, but the 2018 budget proposal is the first time such a plan has been explicitly endorsed by a presidential administration.  Some have expressed concerns that Trump's ISS plan, which is entirely dependent on the as yet untested assumption that there is enough interest in commercial ventures to raise the billions needed annually to keep the station running safely, serves to negate the U.S.'s substantial financial investment in the facility.Responding to rumors that Trump’s budget would end funding for the ISS, Republican Senator Ted. Cruz said:As a fiscal conservative, you know one of the dumbest things you can do is cancel programs after billions in investment when there is still serious usable life ahead.Bill Nelson, a Democratic senator from Florida and former astronaut also strongly objected to plans to privatize the station:Turning off the lights and walking away from our sole outpost in space at a time when we’re pushing the frontiers of exploration makes no sense.Mark Mulqueen, the head of the space station program for Boeing Aerospace, NASA’s biggest ISS contractor, told The Post that he was against the idea:Walking away from the International Space Station now would be a mistake, threatening American leadership and hurting the commercial market as well as the scientific community.Still others have questioned the logistics of selling off an asset that, while mostly funded by the United States, is still an international collaboration involving the investment of many other nations. According to a report in Wired:The ISS is actually a UN-style partnership. It was built and operated with help from Russia, Europe, Canada, and Japan, all of whom use the station to train their own astronauts, conduct biomedical research, and test new technology. Even though NASA has paid the lion’s share of the ISS costs over the past 20 years, those countries all pitched in money, astronauts, and rocket time — and it doesn’t appear that anyone at the White House or NASA asked them about this new privatization plan."	true
1778	CNN asked a survivor of the 14 February 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida to deliver scripted remarks during a televised town hall.	"On 21 February 2018, a week after a gunman killed seventeen people during a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, a survivor of the attack accused CNN of trying to dictate what he should say during a town hall the event hosted to address gun safety arguments in the wake of the massacre.Following the broadcast on 21 February 2018, Colton Haab, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, told local news station WPLG-TV:CNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions and it ended up being all scripted.Haab, a member of the school's junior ROTC program who protected some of his fellow students during the assault by using Kevlar marksmanship sheets, was shown on camera with questions he said he had written prior to the event. He said:I expected to be able to ask my questions and give my opinion on my questions.According to WPLG, Haab wanted to suggest that military veterans be employed as school security guards. But because CNN wanted him to ask ""scripted"" questions, he said, he opted not to appear. In a separate appearance on Fox News on 17 February 2018, Haab said that teachers who are willing to carry their firearm on campus and had received appropriate training would also make schools safer.President Donald Trump also called for more schoolteachers to be armed during a televised meeting with survivors of the Parkland attack, when a gunman killed seventeen people. The network responded to Haab's allegations on 22 February 2018 in a statement posted on its communication team's Twitter account:There is absolutely no truth to this. CNN did not provide or script questions for anyone in last night's town hall, nor have we ever. After seeing an interview with Colton Haab, we invited him to participate in our town hall along with other students and administrators from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Colton's father withdrew his name from participation before the forum began, which we regretted but respected. We welcome Colton to join us on CNN today to discuss his views on school safety.Haab reiterated his account in another Fox News interview on 22 February 2018. He said that a CNN producer first asked him to write a speech for the event, then asked him to submit questions. However, he said, the producer later asked him to ask one question (which appears around the two-minute mark):What they had actually done is wrote out a question for me 'cause in my interview with CNN I talked about arming the teachers— if they were willing to arm [themselves] to carry on campus. She had taken that of what I had briefed on and actually wrote that question out for me.CNN responded again on Twitter, saying:There is absolutely no truth to this story — and we can prove that. CNN did not provide or script questions for anyone in last night's town hall, nor have we ever. Those are the facts.While a number of Douglas High students have advocated for tighter gun safety laws in the wake of the shooting — and been accused of being ""crisis actors"" since doing so — Haab is, to date, the only student to accuse CNN of trying to script their statements at the town hall event.On the afternoon of 23 February 2018, CNN released its e-mail exchange between the network, Colton Haab, and his father, Glenn Haab, along with the following statement:The Stand Up: The Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action Town Hall was intended to be a forum for students, parents and teachers to speak directly to the elected leaders and stakeholders that are at the center of this critical issue. It is unfortunate that an effort to discredit CNN and the town hall with doctored emails has taken any attention away from the purpose of the event. However, when presented with doctored email exchanges, we felt the need to set the record straight.In the exchange, Glenn Haab had presented the network with several pages of ""background points"" that he wished his son to recite before asking a question of Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Florida):Opening statement:
page 1
Ladies & gentlemen, lawmakers, fellow students, parents, teachers, faculty – last Wednesday will change our lives forever. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families of this horrific attack on our school. To me, it’s totally incomprehensible how this attacker was able to exit an Uber ride, walk into our freshman building and start shooting.There’s been a lot of talk about Gun Control since this senseless attack. Many of my peers are in Tallahassee with lawmakers now – unfortunately yesterday did not go in the right direction for us.I hope the much needed changes to Gun Laws can be made and implemented by the time the next generation (my kids) enters high school.The way I see it- 3 main things have to happen:
1) Tighten up gun laws
2) Secure the school and make it safe
3) Defend the schoolI BASED MY QUESTIONS TONIGHT ON #2 & # 3Question 1)The Number One responsibility of the Federal Government is: To keep Americans safe & secure.
We will be called back to school next week … How do we come back if Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is not safe?
Many of us students are afraid to go back until this school is safe & secure. Only 1 School Resource Officer cannot secure a 45 acre campus with multiple entry and exist points. So my 1st question is:
What is being done to drastically improve the security of the school?Question 2)
page 2There are armed security defending our President, Congressmen, court houses, IRS buildings, banks, jewelry stores, even the Smithsonian has guards with guns. Yet a gunman walked into our school’s freshman building with a rifle… and hero’s like Coach Fies ….unarmed… died trying to stop him. This is totally unacceptable.
Schools are defended with a sign that reads:
This is a gun free zone/it might as well also say:
(Call someone with a gun if there’s an emergency).
It is my opinion and the opinion of many – that this makes us an easy target for evil people to do their evil with little, if any resistance.I personally would much rather see a sign that read:“Please be aware that certain staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas are legally armed and may use whatever force necessary to protect our students”.We students should not have to beg to be kept safe.I ask you: are our students’ lives not as significant as court documents?
As tax returns? As cash money? As a diamond ring or a fine watch?
ARE our lives, our security & safety not as important as old dinosaur bones?My 2nd question is:
What measures are being taken to defend our school from future attacks?
And how can we get select faculty trained and armed to give them a fighting chance, if GOD forbid, there is another attack?Question 3)
page 3There are over 450,000 unemployed Veterans living in the United States.
Many are able, willing & trainable and would find a real purpose in the job of keep our schools safe and defend our students & faculty against evil.
What steps can be taken to utilize our select retired military in this capacity?Closing Statement: page 4
President Trump, Governor Scott, Senators Nelson, Rubio and Deutch, Sherriff Israel, Superintendent Runcie, Principle Thompson – I urge you, the student body urges you, our parents urge you: to secure our school.We cannot wait for legislative Gun Law Changes to be approved and implemented. We are going to be called back to school next week. We need Action Now! We have attended way too many funerals this week.We need to make MSD SAFE Now!Secure all Broward schools, secure all Florida Schools and secure all schools across this Nation.
The Number One responsibility of the Federal Government is:To keep Americans safe & secure.We students should not have to beg to be kept safe.Please secure our school from outside threats from evil people and give the right people the training & tools needed to defend our lives. It’s time for a change! Don’t let the 17 lives lost last week be just another statistic.
Is time to make MSD SAFE! MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN# MSD STRONGThank you!In response, the producer wrote: Hi Glenn.That really is way too long. These are quick questions so that we can get to as many people as possible.This is what Colton and I discussed on the phone that he submitted. He needs to stick to this.Senator Nelson, if Coach Feis had had his firearm in school that day, I believe that he could have most likely stopped the threat. Have we thought about having a class for teachers who are willing to be armed trained to carry on campus?"	false
533	The biological mother of ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson left him $1 in her will.	"A South Carolina probate court affirmed the validity of a hand-written will from Lisa Lombardi, Tucker Carlson's estranged biological mother, that leaves Carlson and his brother ""one dollar each."" The document was discovered after a California court had already settled portions of the Lombardi estate in a manner that left it equally split among three people: Lombardi's surviving husband, Carlson, and Carlson's brother.Following the unexpected firing of Fox News personality Tucker Carlson on April 25, 2023, a flurry of claims — both old and new — about the conservative commentator went viral. One long-standing assertion regarding Carson is that his mother left him only $1 in her will:The claim stems from documents produced amid a multi-generational legal dispute over the inheritance of mineral rights that had been left to Lombardi by her mother. Here, Snopes explains the controversy and the basis for rating the claim ""True.""Tucker Carlson's parents were Richard Carlson and Lisa Lombardi. Lombardi, an artist described by contemporaries as a ""bohemian,"" came from several wealthy ""pioneer families,"" including a man, Henry Miller, dubbed the ""The Cattle King."" At the time of Miller's death in 1916, he owned 3 million acres of rangeland in California, Oregon, Washington, and Nevada.Her family's ownership of this vast expanse declined over the years, but the family retained much of the land's mineral rights. In some cases, real estate transactions allow a person to sell land but retain rights to any profits generated by mining or drilling on the land. Lombardi inherited a portion of her family's mineral rights, which pay or paid out royalties in 1993, when her mother died. Carlson's dad and Lombardi divorced in 1976, when Tucker was 6 years old. The elder Carlson was awarded full custody of both of their children, and Carlson had little to no relationship with his mom after the divorce. As reported in a profile of Carlson published by Insider, Lombardi ""disappeared from her sons' lives,"" according to Carlson's childhood friends. Carlson was later adopted by his father's second wife — Swanson frozen chicken heiress Patricia Swanson. Lombardi died on Oct. 14, 2011, while abroad in France with her husband. Just shy of a year later, a lawyer for Tucker and brother Buckley Carlson filed a petition in Kern County, California, for a court to rule on the succession of property owned by Lombardi. That court was entitled to rule on such a matter due to Lombardi's ownership of mineral rights in that county. With the agreement of Lombardi's surviving husband, Michael Vaughan, the court finalized a settlement ruling that Lombardi died ""intestate"" (without a will), and that property with mineral interests and royalty shares totaling about $129,684 would be distributed evenly between Vaughan and the two Carlson brothers. That ruling went into effect in July 2013. After finding a hand-written will in 2013 leaving virtually all of her estate to Vaughn, however, Vaughan's family filed a petition in South Carolina, Lombardi's legal residence at the time of her death, to become the legal representative of Lombardi's estate and officially enter the will into probate. This handwritten document contains the instructions that Tucker and Buckley Carlson receive ""one dollar each"" at issue in viral claims:
 The Carlsons at first objected to the admission of this will into the South Carolina probate case, describing it as a potential forgery. In addition to instruction to give $1 to each of her estranged sons, the will also provided that Vaughan get all her property, including the aforementioned mineral rights: The Carlsons dropped their challenge to the will's admission in South Carolina probate court. Kern County ultimately ruled that the will, while legally valid, could not affect the past distribution of settlement funds due to California probate law. Copies of this will were included as exhibits in multiple attempts by Vaughn and other Lombardi family members to overrule the Kern County settlement based on several legal theories, including that the above will invalidated the previous settlement, that Lombardi never gained possession of some or all of the mineral rights in question, and that they were never part of her estate. This latter claim required lawyers for the estate of Lombardi's long-deceased mother to get involved in the dispute. Ultimately, Kern County denied these attempts, finding Vaughn bound by prior admissions in the original case and that the lack of timely admission of the will to the Kern County court was not the fault of the court system. In other words, the Carlson brothers got more than the $1 Lombardi's August 1995 will stipulated, and this decision has been affirmed several times. Just because the will did not affect the Kern County settlement does not mean the document is not valid or not Lombardi's authentic wishes. According to court testimony, Isabell Vaughan, one of Michael's daughters from a prior marriage, ""discovered Lisa's handwritten will in Lisa's painting room and office"" in the Fall of 2013. As described in an Insider profile:""Lisa was basically sort of a hippie and a free spirit,"" said one attorney who represented the Vaughan family and recalled having conversations about the case. ""She was very liberal and she did not agree with Tucker's politics. But she stuck the will in the book, everyone forgot about it, and then she passed away.""The Carlsons originally challenged the admission of that will in the South Carolina probate case, arguing that the will ""was a forgery"" and that Vaughn had already signed documents in Kern County indicating Lombardi left no will. Vaughn's lawyers hired a handwriting expert who concluded it was ""highly probable"" that the will was authored by Lombardi. The Carlsons voluntarily dropped their objection.This left the admission of the will in Lombardi's South Carolina probate case without any objections or challenges. Legally speaking, then, that handwritten document is the last will and testament of Lombardi, and it effectively cut her estranged sons out of her inheritance. For that reason, the claim at issue in this story is true. "	true

"In May 2021, as the world prepared for the second of two ""super moons"" that year, internet users marveled at a photograph that was presented as a view of an earlier super moon, set behind the temple of Poseidon in Greece. For example, on May 18, one user on Reddit posted the photograph along with the caption: ""This is what a 'super moon' at the Temple of Poseidon looks like"":The photograph was authentic, and the description was accurate. We are issuing a rating of ""True.""The technical name for a super moon is a ""perigee moon."" It occurs when a full moon coincides with the moon's reaching ""perigee"" — that is, the nearest point to the earth during the lunar orbit, which is elliptical rather than perfectly round. When that takes place at the same time as a full moon, the moon appears unusually large to us earthlings and produces some spectacular and dramatic views. In 2014, three perigee moons took place in a row — on July 12, Aug. 10, and Sept. 9.

5849	Over 500 members of a caravan of asylum seekers traveling through Mexico to the U.S. border at San Diego were arrested in possession of suicide belts.	"On 1 May 2018, the web site Daily World Update published an article reporting that over 500 members of a ""caravan"" of asylum seekers traveling through Mexico to the U.S. border at San Diego had been arrested in possession of suicide belts:
Over 500 members of the “Migrant Caravan,” a massive collection of refugees and immigrants moving towards our southern border, have been arrested by Mexican authorities after an early morning raid on their camp. According to Eduardo El Guapo Cardinal, his troops went tent by tent, waking the occupant when something fishy was found:“What we found were more than 500 ISIS soldiers posing as ‘immigrants’ fast asleep with their suicide belts right next to them. We’re lucky nobody was blown up in the raid.”
None of this was true: Neither hundreds of ""ISIS soldiers"" nor hundreds of ""immigrants"" bearing suicide vests have been arrested near the U.S.-Mexico border. This report was a fabricated story that originated solely with Daily World Update, a site that is part of a fake news network which engages in political trolling under the guise of offering ""satire.""

"In summer 2023, a rumor spread on social media that claimed searching the phrase ""chicken soup"" in Facebook's search engine returned a warning about child sexual abuse.Facebook chicken soup? What's it about?
by u/Missdigestive1 in facebookThe claim was true, according to an experiment by Snopes and articles by other news outlets corroborating the claim.While the phrase ""chicken soup"" may appear innocent to some people, it has ties to a code phrase that corners of the internet use to refer to child pornography. That phrase is the Spanish translation of ""chicken soup"" — ""caldo de pollo."" ""Caldo de pollo"" shares an acronym (""CP"") with ""child pornography.""According to policies governing Facebook (Facebook Community Standards), the platform does not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children, and bans ""content (including photos, videos, real-world art, digital content, and verbal depictions) that sexualizes real or non-real children.""To check this claim, we tried typing the phrase ""chicken soup"" ourselves into Facebook's search engine. When we hit the ""search"" button, a notification popped up with the title, ""Child Sexual Abuse Is Illegal."" That notification redirected to an article hosted on Facebook's Help Center with the intro, ""I am concerned by my own thoughts about children or by someone else's behavior."" That article read:If you're concerned by your own sexual thoughts about children and young people, or by someone else's behavior (such as a friend or family member), there are organizations that can provide support for people who need help coping with these feelings and urges.Remember, it can be criminal to produce, possess or share photos and videos of children being sexually abused and exploited.

For example, a man who was allegedly caught with child pornography on his phone near Brownsville, Texas, in July 2023 used the phrase in an interview with authorities, according to ValleyCentral.com, a local Texas news website.

According to the complaint, agents asked him about an outgoing message on Telegram that stated ""Tienes CP,"" which translates to ""Do you have CP?""He told agents ""CP"" stands for ""caldo de pollo,"" which translates to chicken soup. He also claimed that ""caldo de pollo"" is a code for child porn, but denied knowing the material was on his phone.Moreover, an NBC article published in April 2020 titled, ""Child sexual abuse images and online exploitation surge during pandemic,"" read (emphasis ours):"	true
4766	A video shows an armed robot turning on humans.	"A dystopian but fake video showing a sharpshooting robot turning on its human tormenters fooled some people online in late October 2019 — likely because sophisticated artificial intelligence and increasingly agile robots are quickly becoming a reality.The video was created by Corridor Digital and labeled ""Bosstown Dynamics."" The original can be found on the company's YouTube channel. It shows some men at a gun range who appear to be testing out a very human-like robot by arming it with a gun and then hitting it and knocking it down. The robot continues to shoot, until a man orders it to shoot a robot dog. The human robot instead shoots at the man, takes the dog, and runs away.While some on social media complimented the video makers on their skill at creating a realistic-looking computer graphic, others like gun advocate Chris Loesch appeared to be alarmed by it, at least initially (Loesch later noted he knew the video was fake).This is truly astonishing and frightening. Think I’m gonna keep my guns, all of them. pic.twitter.com/6CZDiwFJLu— Chris Loesch (@ChrisLoesch) October 27, 2019
It's not the first time a video created by Corridor has fooled people. In June 2019, a similar video in which a robot pulls a gun on humans who had been abusing it fooled people.But Corridor posted an explainer video to a separate YouTube account (""Corridor Crew"") that explained the video was made using motion capture. In other words, it was a (human) actor playing the part of the robot, and the robot was digitally edited in later.If anyone was fooled by Corridor's digital creation, it may be because robots have grown increasingly sophisticated, and viewers have been primed with real reports of robots who can shoot and do gymnastics."	false
5234	A Chinese lunar rover found no evidence of American moon landings.	"On 4 January 2019, the World News Daily Report (WNDR) published a recycled version of an earlier article reporting that a Chinese lunar rover had found no evidence of American moon landings.  The new version contained contemporaneous references to the Chinese Chang’e-4 spacecraft's making the first ever soft landing on the far side of the moon:
Top officials of the Chinese Space Program have come out this week and expressed their skepticism that the American Moon landings ever happened, reports the Beijing Daily Express.More than 2,000 high-ranking officials of the Chinese Communist Party have signed a petition this week asking explanations from the American government concerning the American Moon landings after doubts arose that the Apollo Moon landings ever happened.These allegations have come up after recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese Chang’e-4 probe allegedly found no traces of the American Moon landings existing on the Moon.Several high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party even stated publicly that these latest findings proved without a doubt that the Moon landings were an “elaborately orchestrated hoax to fool the world about America’s space program capabilities”.
The WNDR article was not factual, of course.  It was just a bit of junk news playing on the long-running conspiracy theory holding that the six U.S. manned lunar landings which took place from 1969-72 were all faked."	false

Arizona saw the highest COVID-19 weekly average per capita in the first few days of 2021 when compared to any other state in the nation — and countries, for that matter.The uptick in cases was reported by ABC15 on Jan. 4, 2021, and included information from a seven-day moving average of new COVID-19 cases based on data from Johns Hopkins University. Between Dec. 29, 2020, and Jan. 4, 2021, the Grand Canyon State reported the highest number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in the world.The graphic below showed newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in Arizona in the seven days leading up to Jan. 4. It comes from 91-Divoc (COVID-19 spelled backward), an interactive visualization tool created by Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Illinois, to track the spread of COVID-19. The data is based on normalized numbers, which streamlines case counts to provide a more equitable comparison between different populations sizes, allowing for case rates to be comparable between states like California and Alaska, for example. Fagen-Ulmschneider described the process as taking the data values — in this case, total cases — and dividing it by the total population multiplied by 100,000.And when it came to Arizona, it was estimated by 91-Divoc that 121.8 newly confirmed cases per 100,000 people were reported daily as of Jan. 4. During the same time period, California logged an estimated 97.8 cases per day — lower than the national average of 65.4 cases that the U.S. reported in the week leading up to Jan. 4, totaling over 215,000 new cases in a one-week period.""This math is done for every state in the US and country in the world and, on the 91-DIVOC graphs, you can mouse over all of that data to view each data point and see the value for every country,"" said Fagen-Ulmschneider. When it comes to the country with the highest rate during this same timeframe, Czechia logged 99.4 new cases per day — still much smaller than totals seen in Arizona in the first week of 2021."	true

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2018The politicization of Tibbetts' death continued in the days following the arrest of Rivera, whom authorities in Iowa say led them to her remains and has confessed to the murder.On 23 August, the right-wing junk news Facebook page ""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" posted a widely-shared meme which claimed that ""liberals"" had started a GoFundMe campaign to collectively raise $5,000,000 for Rivera's bail. It contained what was presented as a screenshot from the GoFundMe website, along with the introductory message: ""Liberals raising the bail money for a murder [sic] just #WalkAway.""""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" added: ""Is this for real? Are Democrats raising money for this [piece of shit]?""#WalkAway is an online campaign which purports to represent individuals who have left the Democratic party, supposedly in dismay at left-wing policies and vehement criticism or disparagement of President Donald Trump. A Twitter tracking tool called Hamilton68, which is run by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, has found that Russian bot networks have boosted the spread of the #WalkAway hashtag. The meme was also promoted in several widely-shared tweets, including one posted by the self-described ""investigative journalist"" Laura Loomer, who has a track record of fabricating and perpetuating conspiracy theories:Soooooooo@jihadwatchRS can’t have a @gofundme for his journalism, but #MollieTibbetts’s illegal immigrant murderer can? ?We need a very powerful lawyer of group of lawyers to sue these tech companies for violation of public accommodation laws.This is absolutely absurd. pic.twitter.com/dnEOoQcGNv— Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) August 23, 2018The meme's central claim is false. Nobody (liberal or otherwise) has set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise Rivera's bail (which is, in fact, $5,000,000.) The meme features some sloppy image editing, for example the jarring difference in font between ""$117,504"" and ""of 5,000,000 to make bail."" It also contains mistakes. On the actual GoFundMe website, the feature which shows how much money a campaign has raised always follows the same format: ""$9,999 of $99,999 goal,"" as shown in the example below:In the GoFundMe mobile app, the same feature is slightly different, always following the format ""$9,999 raised of $99,999 goal."" Neither the website or app display this meter with a description of the campaign (such as ""to make bail"") affixed to the end, and they always include dollar signs before every amount (which is not the case in the fake ""Cristhian Rivera"" meme.)As well being crudely doctored, the ""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" meme does not follow either of these formats, which establishes that it is a fake. No campaign relating to Cristhian Rivera's bail existed on GoFundMe as of 24 August 2018, as a quick search of the website shows. (Neither did any such campaign exist under ""Christian Rivera,"" as the suspect's name is sometimes misspelled, or ""Cristhian Bahena Rivera,"" his full name.) Furthermore, no such campaign had ever existed.When a campaign is removed from GoFundMe, it remains discoverable on search engines. For example, in August 2018 GoFundMe deleted a potentially fraudulent campaign purporting to raise funds for medical care for a Trump supporter supposedly attacked with a brick in Arizona. Performing a Google search for the title of the campaign (""Darrell's medical bills"") still yields a residual URL for that campaign:""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" is a hyperpartisan Facebook page which frequently posts misleading or fake content and memes, some of which we have debunked previously. "	false
1935	The jilted wife of the owner of Home Depot created the Lowe's chain of home improvement stores.	"In 2002 we encountered a rumor that postulated Lowe's Companies, Inc. was begun by the embittered ex-spouse of the owner of The Home Depot, Inc. According to this whisper (which we've since heard from a number of folks), a wife who felt she had not been fairly treated in a divorce used the knowledge she'd gained while in her marriage to create a rival to her husband's chain of home improvement supplies business, even to the point of locating her stores next to his in an effort to steal his customers. Story going around about Home Depot and Lowe's. At one time the owners were married to each other and got a divorce. The wife got a raw deal in the divorce so to get even she builds a Lowe's store as close to a Home Depot as she can.
A less well-traveled form of the basic rumor asserts the following:I heard that the reason Home Depot and Loewe's are always built in close proximity to each other is that the ""owners"" of Home Depot and Loewe's are ex-spouses and that part of the divorce settlement is that wherever Home Depot builds a store, there must be a comparable space available for Loewe's to go in. In that version, neither spouse is presented as bent upon driving the other's business into the ground; instead, the puzzling concurrence of so many Lowe's and Home Depots is explained as a condition of the divorce and therefore as an item worked out and agreed to by both parties rather than as something one was doing to taunt or punish the other.As inherently satisfying as both forms of the legend are, there isn't a shred of truth to either. Lowe's was started in 1946 as a single store in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, by two brothers-in-law, James Lowe and Carl Buchan. Within a few years Buchan bought out Lowe but kept the Lowe's name, possibly because he liked the sound of ""Lowe's Low Prices."" Buchan died in 1961, the same year the company went public. Lowe's began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1979, and by 2004 its sales totaled $36.5 billion. As of 2005,  Lowe's operates more than 1,100 stores in 48 states. Its current President and Chief Executive Officer is Marvin R. Ellison, who has held that position since 2018. Before him, the Chairman, President, and CEO was Robert A. Niblock. Home Depot was founded in 1978 in Atlanta, Georgia, by Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank, two top executives who had recently been fired from Los Angeles-based Handy Dan (another home improvement chain), and  Kenneth Langone, a New York investment banker who helped the pair gain the financing they needed to launch their venture. The company went public in 1981, and by 2005 the parent company, The Home Depot, Inc., was operating more than 1,800 stores (Home Depot, EXPO, and other subsidiary companies) in 50 states, the District of Columbia, the ten Canadian provinces, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. While Home Depot does not yet have stores in China, it did recently open two sourcing offices in that country. The current Chairman and CEO of Home Depot is Craig Menear, who has held that position since 2014.We can only guess why the rumor of a vengeful wife has attached to these two home improvement emporiums, speculating that it's possible the tale sprang in part from someone's having noticed the two retailers often locate their stores near one another, a practice that does appear to fly in the face of generally accepted business wisdom regarding not building too close to one's competitor. Yet Lowe's and Home Depot seem to want to go head-to-head in battling for the home improvement dollar, with both companies appearing to seek out locations as near as possible to the other's stores. (For instance, Home Depot announced in 2003 that it planned to build one of its stores in Olive Branch, Mississippi, a scant half mile from the spot on which Lowe's had just six weeks earlier declared it would build.) And in some cases, one retailer will choose to put its store right beside the other's, as in 2003, when Home Depot opened one of its outlets right next to an existing Lowe's in East Brainerd, TN.While a variety of rotten tricks have over the course of human history been pulled by retaliation-minded spouses of both sexes, few and far between have been acts of an empowering nature (which would have been the case here if this legend had been true about a wronged wife who started her own business, then used it to take on the giant in its business sector because she was determined to teach her ex- a lesson). Far more common in situations where there is an acrimonious split between a husband and wife who have knowledge of each other's business dealings is the clandestine phone call to the IRS in which misgivings are expressed about the accuracy of the other spouse's corporation's tax returns and a suggestion that an audit of that company's books might not be such a bad idea. As many a vengeance seeker has discovered, who needs the likes of Tony Soprano to administer a sharp and memorable lesson when Uncle Sam is but a phone call away?While this next story (which has been reported as true in Canada, yet so far defies our efforts to confirm it) isn't quite on point, it is similar enough in terms of a retribution-bent wife using ""her"" business to take apart his and humiliate him in the process to bear mentioning here:"	false
4335	Tear gas is a chemical weapon banned in international law for use in warfare.	"Across the United States, protests took place through May and June 2020 against the deaths of Black people at the hands of police, spurred by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man in Minneapolis. Law enforcement agencies have increasingly relied on the use of tear gas as a method of controlling protesters and crowds. Authorities, for instance, used tear gas in Washington, D.C., to clear protesters from the area of a church that U.S. President Donald Trump walked to for a photo opportunity.Snopes readers have asked us whether tear gas is banned for use in warfare. Tear gas — deemed a ""Riot Control Agent"" according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — is indeed banned by the 1997 international Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) for use by nation states in warfare. The CWC, to which the U.S. is a signatory, uses the phrase ""Riot Control Agents"" in its text. According to Article 1, ""General Obligations,"" the law states that, ""Each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare.""However, the law does not stop domestic law enforcement officers in individual nations from using tear gas as a method of riot control on streets and in other spaces in their respective countries. The law states:""Purposes Not Prohibited Under this Convention"" means:...(d) Law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes. The logic behind the distinction, according to one report, is that once riot control agents were used as a weapon by nations in war, the fight could escalate to include more dangerous chemical weapons, like nerve gas. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has called this decision ""controversial"" and cited numerous examples in which the organization says U.S. law enforcement officers have used tear gas both excessively and indiscriminately in protests. Some background on the CWC: The U.S. ratified it in 1993, but it didn't go into effect until 1997. According to Encyclopaedia Britannica, tear gas was first used in World War I for chemical warfare, but because its effects were short-lasting, domestic law enforcement authorities began to use it to disperse mobs and rioters.  ""Riot Control Agents"" are defined in the convention as, ""Any chemical not listed in a Schedule, which can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure.""Tear gas has a number of effects on people, according to the CDC, including causing extreme irritation to the area of contact for a period of time (usually 15 to 30 minutes). Also:Long-lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose of a riot control agent, or tear gas, can have the following effects, according to the CDC:In June 2020, a number of cities in the U.S. proposed bans, or moratoriums, on tear gas use as a method of crowd dispersal by law enforcement, amidst fears that the chemical irritants used in the gas will make bodies more vulnerable to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. As noted above, tear gas can cause long-term harm, including making people more susceptible to pneumonia, influenza, and other illnesses. "	true
4112	"Rutgers University or Rutgers' English Department Chair Rebecca Walkowitz wrote in June 2020 that ""grammar is racist"" or words to that effect."	"In the summer of 2020, readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of online articles reporting that Rutgers University in New Jersey had ""declared grammar racist."" On July 24, the Washington Free Beacon posted an article with the headline ""Rutgers Declares Grammar Racist."" The article reported:""The English department at a public university declared that proper English grammar is racist. Rutgers University's English department will change its standards of English instruction in an effort to 'stand with and respond' to the Black Lives Matter movement. In an email written by department chair Rebecca Walkowitz, the Graduate Writing Program will emphasize 'social justice' and 'critical grammar.'""Several other websites and blogs posted articles that claimed that Rutgers had declared grammar, or ""proper grammar,"" racist. Some placed quotation marks around the word ""racist"" in their headlines and articles, indicating that that description had originated in something written or uttered by the university or its faculty.Those reports were false. Neither Rutgers, nor its English department, nor that department's chair, Walkowitz, described grammar, ""proper grammar,"" or the teaching or use of grammar as ""racist."" Nor did they imply it was racist or use words to that effect. The controversy originated in a June 19 open letter published on the website of Rutgers' English department and signed by Walkowitz. The lengthy and detailed post outlined the measures being taken by the department in order to ""stand with and respond to the Black Lives Matter movement; to create and promote an anti-racist environment in our workplace, our classes, our department, our university, and our communities; and to contribute to the eradication of the violence and systemic inequities facing black, indigenous, and people of color members of our community, to which the #BLM movement and ongoing protests have drawn our attention in pointed and necessary ways.""In one of dozens of sections, Walkowitz wrote that the English department's Graduate Writing Program would be undertaking three initiatives. One of those was ""Incorporating 'critical grammar' into our pedagogy."" On that, Walkowitz wrote:""This approach challenges the familiar dogma that writing instruction should limit emphasis on grammar/sentence-level issues so as to not put students from multilingual, non-standard 'academic' English backgrounds at a disadvantage. Instead, it encourages students to develop a critical awareness of the variety of choices available to them [with] regard to micro-level issues in order to empower them and equip them to push against biases based on 'written' accents.""Nowhere did the letter describe grammar as ""racist."" Online posts that placed quotation marks around that word therefore misled readers by presenting it as a direct quotation. Walkowitz's letter also did not include statements that could fairly or reasonably be summarized as ""declaring grammar racist.""Contrary to Leonydus Johnson's claim in the Washington Free Beacon, the letter also did not ""[make] the racist assumption that minorities cannot comprehend traditional English."" Johnson also falsely claimed that Walkowitz's letter endorsed or articulated ""the idea that expecting a student to write in grammatically correct sentences is indicative of racial bias."" It did not do that. Neither did the English department propose to ""alter grammar rules for nonwhite students,"" as the Washington Examiner falsely claimed. In fact, Walkowitz's letter explicitly stipulated that the ""critical grammar"" initiative ran counter to what she called ""the familiar dogma that writing instruction should limit emphasis on grammar/sentence-level issues so as to not put students from multilingual, non-standard 'academic' English backgrounds at a disadvantage."" Walkowitz told Hank Kalet, a lecturer in the Communications department at Rutgers and the author of a blog post about the controversy, that the department's plan would actually result in ""more attention to grammar in the aggregate, not less."" She added that, ""Our standards remain rigorous and high, and our goal is to help students succeed in academic writing and other writing genres.”Kalet provided a good summary of the error made by those who rushed to claim that Walkowitz's letter had ""declared grammar racist."" Of the key paragraph in the letter, he wrote:This passage should be clear to anyone who takes the time to read what is written. The ""familiar dogma"" here is the problem. It assumes that students from multilingual backgrounds will be harmed by a focus on grammar at the expense of broader writing issues. This dogma can leave students without the strong, sentence-level foundation they need to write well."	false

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 and 2021, one of the most repeated pieces of medical advice was to wear a mask and avoid big crowds, especially indoors. Well, it turns out that medical experts have been doling out this simple advice for more than a century. An image supposedly showing a newspaper article entitled ""The Do's and Don'ts for Influenza Prevention"" that was published in the Douglas Island News, a newspaper from Douglas, Alaska, in 1918 was widely circulated on social media:This is a genuine newspaper clipping from the Nov. 15, 1918, edition of the Douglas Island News. This piece of advice was published directly next to a news article reporting that city health authorities were making it mandatory for everyone in the city to wear a mask while away from their homes.You can see both articles below from Newspapers.com: 15 Nov 1918, Fri Douglas Island News (Douglas, Alaska) Newspapers.comMuch of the advice in this column still rings true today. While influenza and COVID-19 are not the same disease, they are both contagious respiratory illnesses, and can both be prevented using similar measures. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, health officials have repeatedly emphasized the benefits of wearing a mask, similar to the advice doled out during the flu pandemic in 1918. Also, health officials have urged citizens to avoid crowds and to wash their hands, similar to the advice given in the above-displayed newspaper clipping.While health officials in 2021 have not told anyone (as far as we can tell) to gargle with a solution of salt and water, there has been much discussion about putting the safety of the community ahead of the convenience of individuals. In 1918, this do's and don'ts list stated:""Respect the quarantine regulations ... Do not neglect your mask. Do not disregard the advice of a specialist just because you do not understand. Do not disregard the rights of a community - obey cheerfully the rules issued by the authorities. Do not think you are entitled to special privileges... Do not think it is impossible for you to get or transmit influenza.""Unfortunately, health officials have had to repeatedly issue similar advice during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many have argued that mask mandates impinged on their personal freedoms. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in July 2020:“You have to have responsibility for yourself but also a societal responsibility that you’re getting infected is not just you in a vacuum. You’re propagating the pandemic.""Former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger expressed a more forceful version of this sentiment in August 2021, saying:""There is a virus here. It kills people. And the only way we prevent it is to get vaccinated, to wear masks, to do social distancing, washing your hands all the time, and not just to think about, 'Well, my freedom is being kind of disturbed here' No. Screw your freedom. With freedom comes obligations and responsibilities. We cannot just say 'I have the right to do x, y and z.' When you infect other people, that is when it gets serious. It's no different than a traffic light. We put the traffic light in the intersection so that someone doesn't kill someone else by accident."" "	true
3367	The Biden administration displayed the Russian flag on the National Mall ahead of Inauguration Day in 2021.	"On Jan. 19, 2021, the night before U.S. President Joe Biden's Inauguration Day, the @MrReaganUSA Twitter account tweeted a picture of the National Mall. The person behind the account posted a message with an emoji of the flag of the Russian Federation: ""I don't know if the Biden administration is aware of this. But this is the Russian flag. No joke.""The tweet ended with ""no joke,"" and some Twitter users who replied didn't seem to think it was a joke, either. ""That's actually the first thing I thought,"" wrote one person. ""Exactly what I thought last night when I saw the photo,"" replied another.However, the flag display did not ""hint"" at anything, despite what a third Twitter user said. The Biden administration did not display a Russian flag. Rather, a display of various flags appeared at a distance as stripes of many different colors stretching the length of the National Mall.Further, others on Twitter pointed out that you could just as easily find in that sea of colors other combinations that resembled the flags for France and the Netherlands, for example.NPR reported that the flags on the National Mall were part of the ""Field of Flags"" installation:In lieu of the crowds of spectators that fill the National Mall for a typical inauguration, this year the iconic stretch of land will be filled with nearly 200,000 flags, representing the thousands of people who cannot attend because of the coronavirus pandemic and tight security in the nation's capital.The art display represents all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the five U.S. territories: American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.This photograph of the National Mall showed Tennessee's mostly red flag in the foreground. Other state and territory flags followed into the distance near the Capitol. Most of the flags appeared in red, white, and blue colors: A worker adjusts decorative flags on the National Mall on January 19, 2021 in Washington, DC.

This Field of Flags, which will cover the National Mall up to 13th Street, will represent the American people who are unable to travel to Washington, DC, and reflect PIC’s commitment to an inclusive and safe event that everyone can enjoy from their home. To include the American people in the inaugural ceremonies, PIC is welcoming Americans to become a symbolic sponsor of the Field of Flags in exchange for a donation to PIC’s partners in service.The tweet from @MrReaganUSA, an ardent supporter of former President Donald Trump, appeared to overlook or deflect from Trump's history with Russia.

3260	In Spring 2021, a brood of billions of cicadas will emerge from the ground after 17 years underground near the Washington, D.C., metro area.	As billions of cicadas were expected to emerge from their earthly home of 17 years across an anticipated 15 states in spring 2021, social media users took to the internet to jest about the ill-fated timing of such an onslaught of insects.Others used it as an opportunity to compare the emergence with post-quarantine life.Brood X (10) is expected to emerge in the Washington, D.C., metro area for the first time since 2004, according to the 2021 Periodical Cicada Emergence published by the University of Connecticut. Brood X is among the largest geographic extents of the 17-year, or periodical, cicadas, with large populations that can stretch from the Midwest to the East Coast. North Carolina State University noted that periodical cicadas are likely to emerge in May, or between two and four weeks after the petal fall when most flowering trees lose their last petals.Bugs in the Cicadidae family are distinguished from other insects by their mouthparts modified into a slender, jointed beak for sucking up fluids — and of course their unusual breeding patterns. There are actually many species of cicadas divided into two types, those that mate annually — called annual cicadas — and those that mate periodically, between two and 18 years. The latter — known as periodical cicadas — will cut v-shaped slits into pencil-width tree branches to lay hundreds of eggs. Between six and 10 weeks later, these eggs will hatch and young termite-like cicadas will feed on tree fluids. Eventually, the young cicadas drop to the ground where they burrow and feed before eventually emerging as nymphs from their underground tunnel to shed their exoskeleton, spread their wings (so to speak), and find a mate. While annual cicadas typically spend between two and four years underground and emerge in much lower numbers, nearly all members of each periodical brood — or hatching — will emerge every 13 or 17 years in one grand exodus and are absent in the years until their next emergence.All said and done, a cicada emergence typically lasts between six and eight weeks. After mating and laying eggs, the short time above ground will signify the end of the adult cicadas' lifecycle. In anticipation of this slew of flying, singing, and mating insects, some readers wondered whether the 2-inch-long cicadas could harm humans, their pets, or their property.Gary Parsons, an entomologist at Michigan State University, noted that cicadas are harmless — although they can be a nuisance.“Cicadas do not bite and are harmless to humans and property — other than being a nuisance. They may amass in millions in parks, woods, neighborhoods and can seemingly be everywhere. When they are this abundant, they fly, land and crawl everywhere, including occasionally landing on humans,” Parsons said in advance of the 2020 emergence of Brood IX.Dogs or other pets have been known to feast on the red-winged insects, but the American Kennel Club (AKC) notes that in most cases, animals will be fine after eating a few cicadas.“However, dogs that gorge on the large, crunchy insects will find the exoskeleton difficult to digest and can suffer serious consequences,” said AKC chief veterinary officer Jerry Klein.Canines who gorge themselves may experience an upset stomach and abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody diarrhea that may require medical treatment if the condition is severe enough.Plants, on the other hand, may experience some adverse effects of the hatch. Grooves in tree branches caused by feeding cicadas can kill small branches and harm trees while implantation can cause small branches to split and wither in a phenomenon known as “flagging,” which can stunt or kill some plants. 	true
841	Valentine's Day was invented by greeting card companies.	"The idea that Valentine's Day, which falls yearly on Feb. 14, was a cynical gambit by greeting card companies, came with a line of dialogue in the 2004 Jim Carrey/Kate Winslet romance ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""""Valentine's Day is a holiday invented by greeting card companies to make people feel like crap,"" Carrey's character, Joel, stated.It's a pithy line and sums up the cynicism some may feel about the holiday, on which those in romantic relationships often demonstrate their affection with things like flowers, cards, gifts, and candy. No doubt the holiday is good day for card companies, along with candy makers, jewelry retailers, and restaurants.But is it true that they invented it?The origins of Valentine's Day are murky, but it seems safe to say that the holiday started as a day of expressing appreciation for romantic relationships well before card companies, as they exist today, got involved. Although some point to a violent fertility festival in ancient Rome called Lupercalia as a possible origin, others note that at least two saints named Valentine were executed by the Roman Empire in the third century A.D.It's a popular belief that Valentine's Day is a religious holiday centered around a saint named Valentine. History professor Lisa Bitel, however, noted that this belief doesn't withstand scrutiny. She wrote in 2018 that it was more than 1,000 years after these executions that the romantic association with Feb. 14 appeared in the work of ""Canterbury Tales"" author Geoffrey Chaucer. Bitel noted:It seems that, in Chaucer's day, English birds paired off to produce eggs in February. Soon, nature-minded European nobility began sending love notes during bird-mating season. For example, the French Duke of Orléans, who spent some years as a prisoner in the Tower of London, wrote to his wife in February 1415 that he was ""already sick of love"" (by which he meant lovesick.) And he called her his ""very gentle Valentine.""English audiences embraced the idea of February mating. Shakespeare's lovestruck Ophelia spoke of herself as Hamlet's Valentine.In the following centuries, Englishmen and women began using Feb. 14 as an excuse to pen verses to their love objects. Industrialization made it easier with mass-produced illustrated cards adorned with smarmy poetry. Then along came Cadbury, Hershey's, and other chocolate manufacturers marketing sweets for one's sweetheart on Valentine's Day.According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, it wasn't until the 1700s that card sellers began selling commercially printed valentines. ""The first commercial valentines in the United States were printed in the mid-1800s,"" according to the Britannica.Although one can't factually argue the holiday was ""invented"" by greeting card companies, the mass production of cards appears to have played a key role in its popularity in the U.S.Boston-based TV station WCVB reported that the manner in which Valentine's Day is celebrated today is owed, at least in significant part, to the city of Worcester, Massachusetts, and an entrepreneur named Esther Howland. Howland ""started making her first valentines in 1848 with an assembly-line operation. She first advertised her business in 1852."""	false

In January 2022, a controversy emerged in Boston when the family of a 31-year-old man, David ""DJ"" Ferguson, protested that a local hospital had removed him from its list of heart transplant recipients, because he had refused to be vaccinated against COVID-19. On Jan. 25, for example, the Daily Mail reported that:An unvaccinated and gravely ill 31-year-old father-of-two has been taken off the donor list for a heart transplant by a Boston hospital because he 'does not believe' in the COVID vaccine. DJ Ferguson, who has a hereditary heart condition that causes his lungs and heart to fill with blood and fluid, was denied the life-saving organ transplant by Boston Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.The hospital said it removed Ferguson from the donor list because all transplant recipients need to get the vaccine in order to ""create both the best chance for successful operation and also the patient’s survival after transplantation.""Similar articles were published by BBC News, the New York Post, the Daily Beast, and Sky News, among others. Those accounts accurately stated the core facts of the case: Ferguson did require a heart transplant, and Brigham and Women's Hospital did remove him from the recipient list because he refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine. We are issuing a rating of ""True."" However, many reports did not explain well to readers some important pieces of context.Firstly, the decision to remove Ferguson from the transplant list was not part of a new, politicized moral crusade against COVID-19-unvaccinated individuals, in particular. Rather, it was just the latest manifestation of a broader, long-standing approach — set out in professional guidelines — of attempting to maximize the likelihood of a given transplant being successful, by requiring individuals to take certain actions or give up statistically risky behaviors (such as smoking or drinking alcohol) in advance. This ethical imperative becomes even more acute in a scenario where the demand for organ transplants outstrips the supply — meaning some prioritization is unavoidable. Secondly, in principle, Ferguson has the option of applying for a heart transplant with another provider. Though he might encounter similar barriers at other hospitals if he continues to refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19, this is an important fact that many news reports ought to have included, but did not.Though Brigham and Women's Hospital did not name Ferguson, they repeatedly gave tacit confirmation that they had indeed removed him from the list of would-be recipients, by providing the following statement to various media outlets, including Snopes. In the interests of providing comprehensive context, we're including the full statement here:At Brigham and Women’s Hospital, we are committed to providing the most appropriate care for our patients with advanced heart disease and do everything possible to effectively improve heart function without a heart transplant. The journey to transplantation is often long because of the shortage of available organs compared to recipients in need, but we work with patients and their families to make each step of the transplant process as comfortable as possible.There are currently more than 100,000 candidates on waitlists for organ transplantation and a shortage of available organs — around half of people on waiting lists will not receive an organ within five years. There is no candidate who is “first on the list” since there are varying levels of priority for allocation of organs. Waitlists are ever-changing and are based on many patient and donor factors. Patient criteria includes immunologic and blood factors, psychological and social factors, medical and surgical factors, and clinical condition. When an organ does become available, it must be carefully matched among a regional and national pool of candidates based on many factors, including blood type, height, weight, medical factors, distance to the recipient and organ size.Given the shortage of available organs, we do everything we can to ensure that a patient who receives a transplanted organ has the greatest chance of survival. Our Mass General Brigham healthcare system requires several CDC-recommended vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine, and lifestyle behaviors for transplant candidates to create both the best chance for a successful operation and to optimize the patient’s survival after transplantation, given that their immune system is drastically suppressed. Patients are not active on the waitlist without this. Research has shown that transplant recipients are at a much higher risk of dying from COVID-19 when compared to non-transplant patients. This guidance is in alignment with recommendations from the American Society of Transplantation, American Society of Transplant Surgeons and International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.The key portion of that statement was the one that declared that Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) ""requires several CDC-recommended vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine, and lifestyle behaviors for transplant candidates... Patients are not active on the waitlist without this."" Since Ferguson has, by his own account, thus far refused any COVID-19 vaccine, there can be little doubt that the hospital had turned down his application, and had done so on that basis.However, BWH's statement did appear to refute one particular claim, namely that Ferguson's name had been at the ""top"" of the transplant list. Rather, the hospital wrote, ""There is no candidate who is 'first on the list' since there are varying levels of priority for allocation of organs."" Heart waiting to be transplanted in 2004 at Broussais Hospital In Paris, France. (Photo By BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)It's worth noting a subtle but important distinction at work here: BWU's decision was likely based not so much on the fact that Ferguson was unvaccinated, but rather that he was refusing to get vaccinated. Brendan Parent, a professor of bioethics at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine, explained to Snopes how hospitals typically give patients the chance to become compliant:In most circumstances, if a patient is unable to demonstrate abstinence from behaviors that could negatively impact transplant success, such as smoking or drinking, they would not be listed for transplant in the first place. It is usually the case that centers would give the patient an opportunity to demonstrate abstinence, with support, as opposed to denying them outright.Similarly, patients would not be listed for transplant unless they receive necessary vaccine to improve chances of transplant success. It is possible that a patient who is listed for transplant could be de-listed if they demonstrate continuous behaviors that could reduce the chance of transplant success, despite repeated opportunities to change these behaviors.Arthur Caplan, also a bioethicist at NYU, told Snopes that COVID-19 vaccine policies such as the one enacted in Ferguson's case did not derive from a ""battle to penalize the unvaccinated,"" nor were they ""made up to discriminate against"" patients such as Ferguson. Rather, the policies were based on long-standing guidelines issued by the relevant authorities.In October 2021, for example, the American Society of Transplant Surgeons published a ""position statement"" on this very subject, which explained the ethical and medical basis for requiring COVID-19 vaccination among would-be transplant recipients.In brief, the ASTS argued that COVID-19 was particularly lethal among transplant recipients, that vaccination helped lower the risks from contracting COVID-19, and that requiring COVID-19 vaccination would simply mean adding one more vaccination to an existing, long-standing list of vaccinations already required for would-be organ transplant recipients. The specific medical reason why transplant recipients were particularly at risk of being infected and sickened with COVID-19 was largely unmentioned in news reports about the plight of Ferguson in January 2022, but it is another important detail here.After transplant surgery, patients are given ""anti-rejection"" medicines that are intended to encourage the body to accept a transplanted organ. By definition, these medicines work by suppressing a patient's immune response, meaning they also leave the body exceptionally vulnerable to infection and illness. Thus, hospitals have for many years required would-be transplant recipients to get vaccinated against several diseases, as a prerequisite to surgery.In other words, what is new in this set of circumstances is not so much the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination as a prerequisite for an organ transplant, but rather the extraordinarily high volume of misinformation and disinformation that has been spread about this particular vaccination, as opposed to the others. Finally, another aspect of this story that many outlets did not properly report: the availability of other transplant centers. Each transplant program makes its own decisions about the status of transplant recipients, though they typically follow the same basic ethical guidelines. As such, Ferguson could, in principle, apply to another transplant center, provided he can find one that does not require COVID-19 vaccination as a prerequisite. When applicants are accepted for organ transplant, they get placed on a national list, known as the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, where a nonprofit called the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) oversees the entire organ donation system, and seeks to match transplant recipients with the correct donor, and so on. A spokesperson for UNOS explained how ""transferral"" between different transplant programs works:Transplant hospitals decide which patients to add to the waitlist based on their own criteria and medical judgement to create the best chance for a positive transplant outcome, with the understanding that the patients will be active participants in their medical care. The transplant team at each program has its own standards for accepting candidates, and if one program is not willing to accept a patient as a candidate, a different program may. Patients have the right to seek transplant at an alternate center. However, the requirements may be the same.Curious about how Snopes' writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption?

4462	"The COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, or H.R. 6666, would authorize federally administered COVID-19 testing groups to enter American homes and force testing against residents' will, and then ""take"" those who test positive to quarantine sites."

On May 1, 2020, as U.S. federal leaders negotiated emergency proposals to combat the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush from Illinois introduced a proposal that would set aside $100 billion to help local agencies identify people who were exposed to the coronavirus without knowing it.Rush, a Democrat who represents much of Chicago's South Side, authored the so-called H.R. 6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act — a 646-word bill that would establish a new grant program under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to which local clinics, hospitals, nonprofits, and schools could apply for funding.But soon after Rush introduced the legislation — a formality in Congressional lawmaking that precedes the committee-hearing process where federal leaders negotiate the specifics of legislation and decide whether it should advance for final votes — critics on Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit began sharing posts describing how they interpreted Rush's legislation.While some of those interpretations suggested the legislation would allow grant recipients to prohibit any non-vaccinated persons into their facilities (Snopes fact-checked that claim here), other interpretations focused on what the legislation would mean for COVID-19 testing.People claimed H.R. 6666 would violate American's constitutional rights by allowing federally-administered testing groups to enter homes against owners' will in order to conduct COVID-19 testing and force people to take the tests, even if they didn't want to. Soon, those types of fears around H.R. 6666 morphed into exaggerated claims that the legislation would allow COVID-19 testing groups to ""enter your house, test and vaccinate you against your will and take your children,"" as one Snopes reader said.Among the most popular claims were those made by anti-vaccine advocate, Dr. Rashid Buttar, who asked viewers in a live video stream on May 8 to share his read on the House bill.Buttar, a licensed Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine in North Carolina, said in the video:Basically this act is to allow individuals to come into your house and if you've got a cough, or somebody in your family has a cough, or you have a fever — or anything that they determine that shows that you have COVID-19 — regardless of whether you've been tested or not, they will also test people. ...They're going to use that to pull you or your loved ones, especially your children, away under pretense of public safety. They're going to say that your child has to be removed from you because you have COVID-19 and so to protect your child, we're going to take the child. Or, we're going to take your grandmother, or your father or you and put you into quarantine.He asked audience members to contact their U.S. representatives to advocate against H.R. 6666, much like online petitions that began circulating around the same time as Buttar's video.But these were completely false claims based on, at best, a misunderstanding of Rush's introduced legislation.As currently written, the legislation would set aside $100 billion in federal money for fiscal year 2020 that ""community health centers, school based health centers, academic medical centers, non-profits (including faith-based organizations) and other entities"" can apply to use, according to a statement from Rush's office and the legislation. Pending no amendments and final approval of the $100 billion bill (as of this writing, it was awaiting its first hearing by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce), federal health officials would prioritize grant applicants from areas that are currently underserved by medical professionals or where the rate of infections exceeds the national average. To that point, Rush elaborated on Twitter:COVID-19 is disproportionately killing black folks. My bill is about increasing testing for minorities & other medically underserved communities ...Under the bill's terms, chosen recipients would then have to use the money to buy COVID-19 testing equipment and personal protective gear, and hire and train people in their communities to run ""mobile testing units"" and do ""door-to-door outreach"" — all with the goal of helping individuals who are isolating at home and figuring out how, exactly, COVID-19 is spreading on a community-by-community basis, according to Rush and the statement.The latter objective, known as contact tracing, involves the following, according to the CDC:Contact tracing is part of the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infection.In contact tracing, public health staff work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the timeframe while they may have been infectious.Public health staff then warn these exposed individuals (contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible.To protect patient privacy, contacts are only informed that they may have been exposed to a patient with the infection. They are not told the identity of the patient who may have exposed them.According to the CDC and national health security officials, that type of on-the-ground work to track COVID-19 transmission patterns is a key strategy for curbing the U.S. outbreak. Per the CDC, ""immediate action is needed"" for communities to ""scale up and train a large contact tracer workforce,"" like what Rush's bill proposes to fund.A COVID-19 response plan by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Health Security summarized the need like this:In order to save lives, reduce COVID-19’s burden on our healthcare system, ease strict social distancing measures, and confidently make progress toward returning to work and school, the United States must implement a robust and comprehensive system to identify all COVID-19 cases and trace all close contacts of each identified case.Rush's legislation had 39 co-authors as of this publication, including one Republican.The legislation does not go into detail on how, exactly, the grant recipients must conduct contact tracing nor how they must operate the ""mobile health units"" during the pandemic. It states:Based on the nature of complaints from critics, the latter point ⁠— that, as necessary, staff would visit people at their homes and provide them services ""related to testing and quarantine"" to limit the spread of COVID-19 ⁠— was likely the source of inspiration for the claims that COVID-19 testing groups could forcibly enter homes and conduct testing.Yet, a few lines lower in the bill, authors wrote ""nothing in this [legislation] shall be construed to supersede any Federal privacy or confidentiality"" requirements — which includes not only privacy protections for how grant recipients could use the medical information of individuals but also the Fourth Amendment right to privacy ""against unreasonable searches"" of property by the government and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states:No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.In other words, the bill's language would not authorize federally-administered groups, including local recipients of the grant money, to forcibly enter homes and test Americans for COVID-19. If a team (funded by the grant) were to knock on the front door to your home, or if you noticed one of their ""mobile health units"" in your neighborhood, you would have the right to decline a COVID-19 test. All testing under the legislation would be voluntary.Additionally, nowhere does the legislation call for the removal of people — including children or elderly Americans — from their homes, as Buttar's viral video claimed. It also does not authorize groups to force Americans to quarantine.""There is nothing in this bill that will threaten anyone's individual liberties,"" Rush wrote on Twitter. ""[It] would increase testing and outreach efforts for communities most impacted by the coronavirus."""	false
3335	U.S. President Joe Biden's lead secret service agent is Chinese.	"Following the inauguration of the U.S. President Joe Biden, internet observers began commenting on images of the new leader's security detail, including an agent of Asian descent apparently in charge of the presidential protection team. For some, this lead them to the racist and baseless conclusion that this agent was from the Chinese Communist Party, who was there to ""protect their property:There are several things wrong with this conclusion, including the implicit statement that anyone of Chinese descent, including American citizens, is an agent of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). More problematic for this specific instance of xenophobia, however, is the fact that the agent in question is a decorated Korean-American Secret Service agent who has also served in former president Donald Trump's protective detail. As reported by The Washington Post in late December 2020, Cho was recently selected to be the lead agent for Biden's detail:The Secret Service ... plans to name a new special agent to lead the Biden presidential detail, David Cho, according to the people familiar with the changes. Known as a perfectionist supervisor, he had risen to become the second-in-command of the protective detail during the Trump administration.Cho was awarded the Department of Homeland Security’s gold medal for exceptional service in 2019 for his negotiations with North Korean officials to arrange security for Trump’s historic visit there, while still overseeing security planning at the White House complex."	false

The company says the ""vast majority"" of showtimes will continue to be offered with closed captioning, meaning it will still make assisted listening devices available at all of its locations.AMC's statement said theater guests can find open caption show times on the company's app and website.

5619	Left-wing protesters vandalized the home of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.	"On 30 September 2018, the same day a real act of vandalism connected to sexual assault accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was reported at the Republican Party headquarters in Rockford, Illinois, false reports emerged saying Kavanaugh's family home had also been vandalized.The reports, published on the websites America's Last Line of Defense (Trumpbetrayed.us) and abcnews.live, and shared widely on social media, said ""left-wing protesters"" caused at least $11,000 in damage to the residence:The family home of Judge Brett Kavanaugh was a scene right out of a frat party gone wrong yesterday, as over 200 left-wing protesters, many wearing masks, shouted profane slogans, waved signs, and threw calendars, bricks, and bottles at the property. Kavanaugh himself was not in the residence, as he is currently in Washington for a symposium on anger management. His wife and children vacated the premisis [sic] and are currently housed in an unknown location for their own safety.The Judge’s home, located at 1512 Whiteman [sic] Street in Mayo Lake, PA, was deluged early in the morning, at the 9:00 hour, as the protesters arrived by van and poured out onto the sidewalk and lawn areas. Neighbors and witnesses reported screaming and loud “jungle drum-like” noises and local police were notified. Officers were shown protest permits, most signed by Diane Fienstien [sic] and Kamala Harris, and chose to remain at the scene in a public-safety capacity. No charges were filed, and the authorities left the area by noon. It was then that the crowd became riotous, and caused upwards of $11,000 worth of damage.The articles included a photograph allegedly taken by Kavanaugh's neighbors:All the image shows is two individuals erasing graffiti from the garage door of a house, however. It pictures no mob of 200 mask-wearing protesters, nor any sign of thrown bricks or bottles, or any other visible evidence of vandalism.As well, no such incident was reported by reliable news sources, including ABC News, despite their logo's appearance above the article published on abcnews.live.The reason the supposed incident wasn't mentioned anywhere else is that it was completely fabricated. The Kavanaugh family doesn't live on ""Whiteman Street"" in Mayo Lake, Pennsylvania -- in fact, there's no such place as Mayo Lake, Pennsylvania.The image dates from 2016 and originally accompanied an article in the Hamilton Spectator (of Ontario, Canada) concerning an act of vandalism prompted by a neighborhood dispute over the cutting down of a tree.America's Last Line of Defense (LLOD) is a network of junk news websites and social media accounts that peddles fabricated, politically divisive content under the guise of ""satire.""

6391	Animal brothels opened in Germany amidst a surge of immigration.	"On 20 December 2017, the Conservative Tribune web site made an outlandish attempt to link purported ""animal brothers"" to a surging migrant population in the country:This article cites two stories in its attempt to connect these two supposed phenomena: A 2013 Daily Mail report about lax animal protection laws, and a 2017 Reuters article about Germany's migrant population. These two articles are not related, and the information in the Daily Mail article is both exaggerated and outdated. The Daily Mail published an article claiming that some animal brothels, or erotic zoos, had opened in Germany after people realized that the country's animal protection laws didn't explicitly ban sex with animals. This article made no mention of migrants being a cause of this problem and the bestiality loophole was closed in 2013 as German lawmakers voted to criminalize ""using an animal for personal sexual activities"":Germany’s upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, voted Friday to criminalize for the first time “using an animal for personal sexual activities” and to punish offenders with fines of as much as $34,000. It was the final legislative hurdle for a bill the lower house passed in December.A German court also upheld the country's ban on bestiality after a 2016 legal challenge.The Daily Mail's claim that ""animal brothels"" were operating in Germany in 2013 may also be an exaggeration. The evidence that these so-called brothels exist appears to be a single quote from a state animal protection officer named Madeleine Martin. However, she did not describe having discovered businesses where people pay to have sex with animals -- rather, she described a group of men sneaking onto a farm to abuse sheep and another man who distributed online pictures and instructions for sex with animals.In other words, a large portion of the Conservative Tribune's article was based on a years-old article that contained outdated and misleading information. The second part of this claim — that Germany's migrant population hit 22 percent — is misquoted information from a genuine Reuters article that was published in 2016 -- three years after the Daily Mail article claiming that ""animal brothels"" exist.The Reuters article does not say that 22 percent of Germany's population are migrants. Rather, it says:The number of people with an immigrant background in Germany rose 8.5 percent to a record 18.6 million in 2016, largely due to an increase in refugees, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday.Just over a fifth of the population - 22.5 percent - were first or second generation immigrants with at least one parent born without German citizenship, the office said.A ""second generation immigrant"" is someone born in the country that their parents immigrated to. In this case, it also includes people with only one parent who was born outside Germany. These people would hardly be considered ""migrants,"" so The Conservative Tribune is incorrect in saying that migrants make up 22 percent of the German population. The Conservative Tribune further misrepresented the makeup of these migrants in their fear-mongering introductory paragraph which stated that a ""flood of refugees fleeing jihadist-filled war zones in the Middle East and North Africa"" poured into Germany. Although Germany did take in a large number of refugees, the Reuters article noted that the ""vast majority of the immigrant population . . . had links to other European countries.""The Conservative Tribune acknowledged this later in their article:To be sure, the majority of those migrants to Germany actually originated in other European nations and are descended from European heritage, but a significant minority of them — particularly those who have come in the past few years — have originated from the Middle East or Africa."	false
1858	The Trump administration is making Puerto Ricans sign promissory notes and surrender passports before evacuating them or rendering aid.	"On 28 September 2017, The Hill and Marketwatch both reported that the Trump administration was ""forcing evacuees from Puerto Rico to sign promissory notes ensuring full repayment for transportation costs"" and was holding evacuees' passports as ""collateral"":[T]he U.S. government, in accordance with a long-standing but discretionary policy, will hold the evacuees' passports as collateral until it gets its money.According to the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs:""Anyone evacuated on U.S.-government coordinated transport, including charter and military flights, must sign an Evacuee Manifest and Promissory Note (Form DS-5528) note prior to departure.”
“The promissory note obligates an evacuated person to repay the cost of the transportation to the U.S. government.""The cost of the ""promissory loan"" is based on ""the price of the last commercial one-way, full-fare (not discounted) economy ticket prior to the crisis."" In other words, the loan isn't based on the discounted economy fare that many visitors probably found online to get to Puerto Rico.That’s not all:""Upon evacuation, a Department of State official must limit an evacuee’s passport. In order to obtain a new passport, an evacuee must arrange payment as agreed upon via the promissory note.""The claim struck a nerve amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in the United States territory of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria caused widespread devastation the week before. The Hill based its report off of Marketwatch's claim, which cited a U.S. Department of State page (""Information for Evacuated U.S. Citizens"") that was not specific to Hurricane Maria, the Trump administration, or Puerto Rico:Procedures for Evacuation:The page has no date stamp, indication of when it was published, or information about when such policy was put into place, and the earliest archived version of the page on the Internet Archive was saved on 15 September 2017; Hurricane Maria did not appear until 16 September 2017. However, identical language was published in a September 2014 Department of State handout [PDF], and the policy clearly antedated ""the Trump administration.""A 19 July 2006 article from ABC News reported:American citizens in Beirut relying on the U.S. Department of State to provide evacuation from the conflict-ridden city are faced with high and rising costs.A July 15 Department of State message tells U.S. citizens it will not ""provide no-cost transportation."" Unable to present U.S. citizens with even up-front estimates for transportation costs, the Department of State has made it known that they require evacuated citizens to sign a promissory note and will bill individuals in the near future for their emergency evacuation. The government is evacuating citizens via helicopter and ferry to Cyprus where they can board commercial airlines home.Faerlie Wilson, an American student studying in Beirut tells ABC News, ""The Department of State makes you sign a form, and then they tell you the costs after.""The policy gained some traction as a topic of debate in early September 2017.The practice of charging evacuated Americans can be documented back to at least August 1944 [PDF]. However, U.S. Code Title 22, Chapter 38, Section 2671 pertains to the return of Americans citizens from places outside the United States, not transport of American citizens to other American territories or states. (Puerto Ricans are American citizens.)It is possible the authors of the articles mentioned here received information not cited in the article about the situation in Puerto Rico, but also possible that policy was presumed to be implemented with no information one way or the other. Neither article made clear that evacuation (not dispatched aid) was the primary plan for rebuilding Puerto Rico, but in any case the relevance of the decades-old policy to the situation in the territory is unconfirmed. Notably, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [PDF] (a law pertaining to federal response and ""natural disaster assistance for state and local governments in carrying out their responsibilities to aid citizens"") defines hurricanes such as Maria as applicable natural disasters and Puerto Rico as part of the United States:(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares that -
(1) because disasters often cause loss of life, human suffering, loss of income, and property loss and damage; and
(2) because disasters often disrupt the normal functioning of governments and communities, and adversely affect individuals and families with great severity; special measures, designed to assist the efforts of the affected States in expediting the rendering of aid, assistance, and emergency services, and the reconstruction and rehabilitation of devastated areas, are necessary.It is the intent of the Congress, by this Act, to provide an orderly and continuing means of assistance by the Federal Government to State and local governments in carrying out their responsibilities to alleviate the suffering and damage which result from such disasters by -(1) revising and broadening the scope of existing disaster relief programs ...
(2) Major Disaster - “Major disaster” means any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, winddriven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this Act to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.
(3) “United States” means the fifty States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.Although it is true that the Department of State billed evacuees for repatriation as far back as 1944, the Trump administration did not invent the policy. By 29 September 2017, The Hill edited their article to reflect that the claim was in fact false:The State Department is not requiring anyone evacuated from hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico to sign promissory notes reimbursing the government for travel costs.Marketwatch reported that the evacuees from Puerto Rico were being required to put up promissory notes under a longstanding policy. The Hill also posted a story based on the Marketwatch report ... But the State policy does not apply to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, a spokeswoman for the department said."	false

While many marveled at the skill (or luck) portrayed in this footage, others were skeptical. Was the internet being duped by another doctored piece of media?The video was taken on the Shambhala ride at the Port Aventura amusement park in Spain. YouTube user SirSammy 15 of New Zealand shared the footage with the following description:I caught a strangers phone in mid air on a roller coaster!I was in Spain at Port Aventura on shambhala ride and saw the person a few rows ahead drop their IPhone X. long story short I caught it. this roller coaster is moving at over 130kms ... was once Europe’s tallest and fastest coaster ... only recently beaten.Some of the roller coasters at Port Aventura are equipped with video cameras to capture the reactions of these thrill-seekers. This footage is then available for purchase at the end of the ride as a take-home souvenir. The Shambhala, the tallest in PortAventura Park, is one such ""videoride.""After the video above went viral, the New Zealand Herald contacted SirSammy 15 (real name Samuel Kempf) for more information about the incident. Kempf said the person who dropped the phone gave him a big hug. And, as a thank you, the phone's owner purchased the above-displayed footage from Port Aventura as a souvenir: ""He couldn't believe it, he gave me a big hug,"" Kempf told Stuff.""The funniest reaction was when we had got off the rollercoaster and you go down to look at the photos and videos they take and half the people there seemed to be watching our screen and then everyone started cheering and clapping when it happened.""The owner of the phone bought the video as a thank you to the Kiwi.While SirSammy's roller coaster phone catch may seem miraculous, it isn't unprecedented. Our search for similar footage turned up two videos from the exact same roller coaster. The first, taken in 2013, shows a man catching a set of keys while riding this roller coaster:The other, also from 2013, shows someone catching a phone:"	true
741	Antifa, not a mob of Trump supporters, violently clashed with police and broke into the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.	"On Jan. 6, 2021, supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump violently converged on the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. in support of Trump's false claims that the November 2020 presidential election was beset by massive scale voter fraud that led to his loss.Trump supporters at the Capitol brawled with police and broke through barricades, eventually breaking into the building while Congress was in the process of counting electoral college votes and confirming President-elect Joe Biden's win.Some on social media started spreading unfounded rumors that the violent chaos was being instigated not by Trump supporters, but by anti-fascist activists, colloquially known by the portmanteau antifa.There is no evidence that the mob storming Capitol grounds and violently engaging police are antifa — in fact the social media accounts spreading the rumor are followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Here is one example of one such tweet, which reads, ""BREAKING: PATRIOTS ARE NOT STORMING ANYTHING!! PAID FOR ANTIFA DOES, PERIOD!!"":It was Trump himself who encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol, as CNN White House reporter Kevin Liptak reported:Shortly after, his supporters took him at his word and marched to the Capitol, breached the building, and as of this writing, were inside.Members of the right wing extremist group Proud Boys, which is known for provoking violence and brawling, have also boasted in discussions leading up to the attack on the Capitol that they would forego their ""uniform"" — which consists of black and yellow — in favor of all-black garb. When they do show up at protests, antifa activists typically wear all black.Qanon followers have been deemed a potential violent threat by the FBI. Here is how we previously reported on the Qanon belief system:In general, QAnon believes Trump is in the middle of a biblical war against a ""deep state,"" satanic cabal of baby-eating, child sex-traffickers led by prominent members of the Democratic party, entertainers who espouse liberal opinions, anybody who mentions ""pizza,"" and authoritative sources who relay credible information that may cast a negative light on the president. Proponents of this theory believe that one day soon the ""storm"" will come and Trump, with the help of an anonymous high-ranking military official known as ""Q,"" will round up members of the deep state, arrest them, and possibly have them executed.Based on the fact that the sources of this rumor are unreliable, and the fact that Trump urged his supporters to do exactly what they're doing now, and that an extremist group known for provoking violence stated that it had planned to dress in black to ""blend in,"" we rate this rumor ""False.""In the days following the attack on the Capitol, wrenching scenes of police officers battered by the mob drew public outrage. Right wing figures on social media continued to push the baseless narrative in an attempt to blame left wing activists associated with antifa and the Black Lives Matter civil rights movement for the violence. Five people were killed, including a Capitol police officer, and dozens of outnumbered police were injured, many of whom fought hand-to-hand with rioters in an effort to prevent them from breaching the building.Some right wing figures pointed to John Sullivan, an accused agent provocateur who filmed the death of Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran and Trump supporter who was shot by police when she tried to break through a barricaded door as rioters broke into the building. Sullivan was arrested in Utah on Jan. 14, 2021, on charges related to the riot.For example, right wing junk site Gateway Pundit's headline reported, ""BREAKING: FBI Arrests Antifa Leader John Sullivan in Utah After Storming US Capitol …Update: With FBI Affidavit."" The story was tweeted by ""Happy Days"" actor and Trump supporter Scott Baio. The unfounded claim has even been embraced by some members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, who has come under fire for an incendiary speech at a rally that preceded the mob attack on the Capitol.But Sullivan, a Utah resident, isn't an ""antifa leader,"" and the idea that he's part of the Black Lives Matter movement was rejected by the local chapter in his home state, as The Intercept's Robert Mackey noted in a detailed analysis:""In fact, Sullivan is a curious figure who is treated with suspicion or outright hostility by a number of left-wing organizers associated with Black Lives Matter and antifascism in Utah, California and the Pacific Northwest.""Mackey went on to report that left wing activists in various cities have warned against associating with Sullivan, accusing him of harmful actions and exploiting protests movements for personal gain."	false
3932	One or more people used the identity of American boxer Joe Frazier, who died in 2011, to illegally vote in Philadelphia.	"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.On the morning of Nov. 7, 2020 — around the same time the world learned voters elected Democrat Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States — Republican President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, held a news conference in a Philadelphia parking lot to attack the integrity of America's democratic process by alleging voter fraud without any evidence.One of Giuliani's many unsubstantiated claims to perpetuate the alleged conspiracy involved onetime heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier, otherwise known as Smokin' Joe. The former New York City mayor asserted that someone, or a group of people, was maliciously using Frazier's identity to illegally cast ballots in Philadelphia though Frazier is dead. Giuliani said:""I know this city has a sad history of voter fraud. After all, Joe Frazier is still voting here, kinda hard since he died five years ago. But, Joe continues to vote. If I recall correctly, Joe was a Republican. So maybe I shouldn't complain. But we should go see if Joe is voting Republican or Democrat, now from the grave.""The accusation was false on several fronts.For starters, yes, Smokin' Joe is dead. However, he died on Nov. 7, 2011, of liver cancer, which was exactly nine years prior to Giuliani's press conference — not five, like the attorney asserted. Additionally, Frazier did not voice political views when he was alive, according to his New York Times obituary, though media and onlookers perceived him, to his consternation, as the American establishment's fighter.But the most extreme assertion Giuliani made was that one or more people had used Frazier's identity to illegally vote on a continuous basis. Although Giuliani did not specify to which election he was referring, the timing and nature of his remarks suggested he wanted his listeners to believe Frazier had ""voted from the grave"" in the Trump-Biden race.To determine the legitimacy of that accusation, we looked up Frazier's birthdate on Britannica — Jan. 12, 1944 — since elections officials in Pennsylvania keep records on registered voters using their birthdates.Next, we reached out to the Philadelphia City Commissioners, a bipartisan board that oversees elections and voter registration in the city, for evidence to confirm or deny whether anyone was illegally using the boxer's identity.At Snopes' request, the office sent screenshots of its voter database showing every person who at one point registered to vote in Philadelphia under the name ""Joseph Frazier,"" as pictured below. Fifteen people fell under that category, including people whose registration was no longer valid, such as the famous boxer himself.As you can see, just one entry showed the same birthdate as Frazier, which meant that entry was Smokin' Joe's voter file in Philadelphia.The election board's office sent us a copy of that specific document, which showed election officials ""canceled"" Frazier's active registration status on Feb. 8, 2012, shortly after his death. He last voted in Philadelphia in 2006, the records show.Considering that irrefutable evidence — which was directly from the state-certified computer system running elections in Philadelphia — we can say definitely that no person or group used the identity of the famous boxer to vote after his death, including in the 2020 presidential election.A spokesman for the board, Kevin Feeley, confirmed with Snopes via email:""The Board of Elections updates all voter records in Philadelphia upon receiving word of a voter’s death from state health officials. The Board has no evidence to support this allegation.""In fact, there was no evidence of any Pennsylvania voter's using a dead person's identity to vote in the 2020 election. “The court found no deficiency in how PA maintains its voter rolls, and there is currently no proof provided that any deceased person has voted in the 2020 election,"" the state's Office of Attorney General said in a statement to The Associated Press.In sum, the claim by Giuliani about Frazier was false, and ultimately part of a campaign by Trump and his Republican allies to convince Americans of a nefarious scheme by Democrats to undermine Trump's reelection — even though elections officials from both political parties say there's no evidence of mass, or even sporadic, voter fraud that influenced the outcome of the election."	false

In June 2017, a stream of hoax images featuring now-president Donald Trump appeared on social media, pushed by Twitter accounts such as @TrumpSnapshots with no explanation or context. One such picture appeared to show a sweaty-looking Trump with balloons stuffed into his shirt:This is not genuine; it is an image was created by digitally manipulating Trump's face onto another person's body.

1379	Some 91 minutes before stopping the shooter, one or more law enforcement officers went inside Robb Elementary School and rescued their own children.	"This rumor came from a viral tweet. It's true that Jacob Albarado, an off-duty Border Patrol officer, helped to evacuate his daughter and several other children. He did so with the assistance of other officers. This happened prior to the moment when officers confronted the shooter. However, in total, the shooter was in the school for around 77 minutes, making the ""91 minutes"" part of the tweet incorrect.On May 26, 2022, racial justice activist Shaun King tweeted that one or more law enforcement officers rescued their own children on the day of the deadly mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, while the incident was unfolding. And that was ""91 minutes"" before the shooter, Salvador Ramos, was stopped, the tweet alleged.The Associated Press initially published an exhaustive article that provided a partial timeline of what local officials say happened at the school that day, a day in which 19 children and two adults were tragically killed.It's true that, before law enforcement confronted the shooter in a classroom, an off-duty Border Patrol officer rescued his own daughter and other children with the assistance of other members of the law-enforcement community. However, surveillance footage released more than one month after the shooting showed that part of King's tweet was incorrect. King claimed the shooter was stopped 91 minutes after one or more officers rescued their own children. This was not possible, as the shooter was inside the school for around 77 minutes total, the footage showed.When this rumor first started making the rounds on Twitter, one user asked King about his tweet, saying, ""Where was this written?"" Another person responded with a tweet that contained a video. That clip was quickly on track to be viewed more than 1 million times from that one upload. (It was downloaded and uploaded again by other Twitter users.)The video came from the San Antonio-based local news station KENS 5. In the clip, KENS 5's Vanessa Croix interviewed Lt. Christopher Olivarez, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety. It was aired live on the evening of May 24, hours after the shooting.KENS 5 posted the interview to its own YouTube channel. The part pertinent to this subject begins at the 1:34 mark in the video:The transcript of the relevant question and answer has been transcribed below:Vanessa Croix: We've heard that some law enforcement officers actually went into [the] school to get their kids out. Can you talk about that?Lt. Christopher Olivarez: Right, so what we do know Vanessa right now that there was some police officers [and] families trying to get their children out of the school because it was an active shooter situation right now. It's a terrible situation right now. And, of course, just as we mentioned the loss of life, it's just terrible, it's a terrible tragedy now that took place, but again we've got to keep acknowledging those brave men and women that actually were there on scene that met the suspect, and of course, we know that they were met with gunfire. Some of them were shot. But at the end of this, the suspect was shot and is now deceased. The threat is now neutralized.We reached out to the Texas Department of Public Safety by email, submitting several questions in an attempt to find the facts behind the matter.Also on May 26, The New York Times published a story that told of an off-duty Border Patrol officer named Jacob Albarado. According to the reporting, Albarado was just sitting down for a haircut when he received a text message from his wife, Trisha, a fourth-grade teacher at the school. The couple had a second-grade daughter who was also inside the school:Mr. Albarado flew out of the barbershop and sped to the school. His wife and the children she taught were hiding under desks and behind curtains. Their daughter, a second grader at Robb, was locked in a bathroom, she had told him. He borrowed a shotgun from the barber, who had come with him.Once he got to the school, he learned that a tactical team was already forming to enter the wing where the gunman was holed up.So Mr. Albarado quickly made a plan with other officers at the scene: evacuate as many children as possible. “I’m looking for my daughter, but I also know what wing she’s in,” he said, “so I start clearing all the classes in her wing.”Two officers provided cover, guns drawn, he said, and two others guided the children out on the sidewalk. “They were just all hysterical, of course,” he said. When he finally saw his 8-year-old daughter, Jayda, he said, he hugged her, but then kept moving the other children along.On May 27, Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw spoke at a news conference in front of Robb Elementary School, making a statement and taking questions. The Associated Press published a story with new details from the remarks that were made.During the news conference, McCraw was asked, ""Did any police officers go in to get their own kids while the parents were outside?"" McCraw responded only with, ""Not that I'm aware of."" (It was reported by a major news organization that McCraw answered by saying ""No,"" which was somewhat different than McCraw's real answer, ""Not that I'm aware of."")The question asked to McCraw about ""while the parents were outside"" referred to the Wall Street Journal's reporting that said, as the incident unfolded, parents outside of Robb Elementary said they were ""tackled,"" placed into ""handcuffs,"" and ""pepper-sprayed,"" all while they were ""encouraging"" the ""police and other law enforcement to enter the school."" We also inquired with the Texas Department of Public Safety about this, but have yet to receive a response.The brief question and answer can be watched in the video below beginning at the 39:00 mark:On July 12, 2022, surveillance footage from inside the school in Uvalde was obtained and published by local journalists. The lengthy video showed that Ramos was inside the school for around 77 minutes before officers entered a classroom that he had entered.This timing meant that part of King's tweet — the reference to ""91 minutes"" — was not possible. It's unclear when, exactly, during the 77 minutes, Albarado and other officers rescued his daughter and the other children."	true
6340	"The word ""Dixie"" was removed from a popular Civil War-themed dinner show in Tennessee."	"On 8 January 2018 the dinner entertainment business World Choice Investments which runs a show in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee that had been called ""Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede"" announced that they would drop the word ""Dixie"" to avoid negative connotations with the antebellum South as the company expands its business to new locations:World Choice Investments, LLC currently operates several dinner show attractions in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Branson, Missouri; and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for Dolly Parton showcasing show concepts featuring live entertainment from heroic horsemanship to swashbuckling pirates.As the expansion plans take shape, the production team is hard at work updating the existing shows for 2018. “Our shows currently are identified by where they are located,” Dolly said. “Some examples are Smoky Mountain Adventures or Dixie Stampede. We also recognize that attitudes change and feel that by streamlining the names of our shows, it will remove any confusion or concerns about our shows and will help our efforts to expand into new cities.” To that end, WCI’s legacy show, Dolly Parton’s Dixie Stampede, will become simply Dolly Parton’s Stampede for the 2018 season.The change in the venue's name prompted cries that Parton and the show's organizers were bending to ""political correctness,"" a buzzword that essentially means adhering to language and policies that do not offend groups that have been socially marginalized or oppressed. For example Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett told Knox News:Well, like everybody else, I love Dolly, and I love all that she's done for our community, which is her community, and I'm disappointed that they're yielding to political correctness. What's next? Are we going to change the name of Dixie cups and the Dixie sugar company? You know, I just hope they don't change their Christmas program.Despite the outcry, which is cropping up around the country as various businesses and local governments remove imagery or language that appears to glorify the slave-owning South, the venue did remove ""Dixie"" from the show's name. The url and web site for the venue have already been changed from ""dixiestampede.com"" to ""dpstampede.com.""The same week that a statue of Robert E. Lee led to the death of an innocent woman in Charlottesville, Virginia, I watched him oink and squeal in a race for the fate of the country. Lee, this time, was a piglet—part of Dolly Parton’s Dixie Stampede, a Medieval Times–style dine-in attraction where seven nights a week and at occasional weekend matinees, the South rises again."	true
3074	A Ferris wheel operator in Opa-locka, Florida, attacked a woman after she exited the ride.	In April 2021, Snopes readers asked for verification of a viral video that showed a male ride operator in Opa-locka, a small city northwest of Miami, Florida, shove a woman with two small children, sparking a furious brawl.Local news reports confirmed the broader strokes of what happened on the evening of April 17, 2021, at the Opa-locka Hialeah Flea Market with police, who responded to the incident. We reached out to the Opa-locka Police Department and the flea market, but have yet to receive a response. We will update this story if we receive any new relevant information.The video that went viral shows a woman getting off the Ferris wheel with two young children. She confronts the male ride operator, although what she said can't quite be heard in the video. The man responds by screaming obscenities at the woman and shoving her, knocking her off her feet, and also causing the smaller of the two children, who appears to be a toddler, to fall down.This did not sit well with bystanders, who immediately respond by jumping in and landing punches on the ride operator. As if that wasn't chaotic enough, the Ferris wheel dangerously started back up, with people on the ride platform.	true
5551	"Journalist Sarah Jeong once tweeted that every time she sees a ""bald white kid"" she secretly hopes ""he had leukemia."""	"In August 2018, a number of years-old tweets posted by journalist Sarah Jeong were dug up and re-shared on the internet in an attempt to show that the newest member of The New York Times' editorial board exhibited a pervasive (anti-white) racial bias:Once Jeong’s hiring was announced, her detractors immediately started digging through her internet history to see what they could find. A survey of Jeong’s past commentary on Twitter reveals several mainly sarcastic tweets dating back to 2013, which were largely discussing and responding to the oppressive mentality of white culture.In tweets like the one embedded above, Jeong appeared to be commenting on the idea that white people often believe they are being discriminated against when they aren’t. To equate “being mean to white people” with the actual systemic oppression and marginalization of minority groups is a false equivalency.Although similar campaigns had resulted in the firings of people such film director James Gunn, the New York Times stuck by their decision to hire Jeong. The controversy slowly faded from the national spotlight, but Jeong remained a target of political trolls.In mid-October 2018, a tweet supposedly posted by Jeong popped up on social media and was pushed by disreputable Twitter accounts with a history of promoting debunked conspiracy theories and spreading alt-right propaganda:This statement (""Everytime i see a bald white kid, i secretly hope he has leukemia and do my own little private 'end-zone' dance"") does not currently appear on Jeong's Twitter timeline, nor did we find any record of it in Jeong's online articles.Social media users dredged through Jeong's social media accounts for similar controversial messages in August 2018. Although these internet investigators dug up dozens of genuine posts which they deemed to be problematic, such as the #Cancelwhitepeople"" message seen above, those examples apparently weren't damaging enough for some internet trolls. Soon, 4Chan users started to create fabricated racist posts which they then falsely attributed to Jeong.We found a number of these fabricated posts in 4chan threads from early August 2018 (including one about a ""castration lottery""), most of which featured the same template as the fake ""leukemia"" quote: a picture of Jeong with pink hair next to a black space containing the alleged quote, Jeong's name, and her position at the New York Times:These fake statements were often met by commentators questioning their authenticity, asking for verification, or chastising the poster for spreading false material. One of the earliest postings of the fake ""leukemia"" quote was accompanied by the following comments:Jeong's detractors took screenshots and archived the problematic tweets in case the journalist decided to later delete them, yet we found no record of Jeong's making this ""leukemia"" tweet. That message was conjured out of thin air in an attempt to stir racial discord and discredit Jeong and the New York Times.Jeong herself labeled the message a ""fake tweet"" on 15 October 2018:<!--it's amazing that someone, replying to a news story about politically motivated sockpuppets, ginned up a fake tweet attributed to me https://t.co/4E5T2nfq4c pic.twitter.com/oXsST2IfUV— sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) October 15, 2018-->"	false

4168	A 2007 study showed burning sage kills 94% of bacteria.	"Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. 
Since as early as October 2019, Snopes readers have inquired about headlines and social media posts that claim burning sage ""kills 94% of bacteria."" In 2020, the question took on new significance for some readers as the United States grappled with a surge of reported cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.Though burning some plants has been scientifically shown to eliminate airborne bacterium, there is inconclusive evidence to suggest that burning sage – or “smudging” – is capable of purifying the air in confined spaces. The ""94%"" claim is based on a 2007 study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology in which researchers analyzed the ability of “medicinal smoke” to cleanse a room of certain airborne bacteria. Reports have since circulated the internet, incorrectly lumping sage into a long ingredient list that included dried roots and leaves tested as part of the experiment.“This is highly controversial since breathing in smoke has known harms, yet the antibacterial benefits are uncertain,” Dean of Yale School of Public Health Dr. Sten Vermund told Snopes. Vermund added that there is no evidence that burning sage kills either bacteria or viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the severe respiratory disease COVID-19.As part of the 2007 study, researchers from the National Botanical Research Institute in India burned medicinal smoke from havan samagri within a confined space to determine whether certain herbs contained antimicrobial properties. Havan samagri is a “mixture of odoriferous and medicinal herbs” that contains dozens of various types of wood, herbs, fruit and seeds used in Vedic Hindu tradition. However, sage was not included in the study’s ingredient list. One hour of burning havan samagri was shown to kill more than 94% of airborne bacteria – and the effects were not short-lived. The evidence further suggested that medicinal smoke had the ability to “purify” or “disinfect” the air for up to 24 hours in a closed room. Even after a month, the researchers found that certain pathogenic bacteria were still absent from the room, such as those that cause respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.Though it appears havan samagri may have some antimicrobial properties when burned, the findings do not suggest its use has any impact on viruses like SARS-CoV-2. This is, in part, due to the biological differences between bacteria and viruses. The Mayo Clinic notes that bacteria are capable of thriving in “many different types of environments” whereas viruses require living hosts to multiply. The way that COVID-19 spreads and how long it is present in the air also plays a role. The virus is known to transmit via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and land in the mouth or nose of someone nearby.Evidence also suggests that the virus spreads when an individual touches a contaminated surface and then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose, though recently published guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) caution that “this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” It is not known how long SARS-CoV-2 may persist on surfaces and research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggests the virus may last at least several hours and up to three days on certain surfaces. Different surfaces and different conditions – such as humidity, temperature, sunlight, and air movements – may see different results. Higher humidity, higher temperature, more airflow, and more sunlight or UV light are less-than-ideal conditions for SARS-CoV-2.“This is subject of uncertainty and will differ for indoor and outdoor spaces. Certain ‘super-spreader’ events have suggested that individuals in the wrong place (i.e. poorly ventilated indoor spaces) at the wrong time may mean considerable risk. But as a rule of thumb, aerosols can disperse across an indoor space,” explained Vermund.The CDC recommends using a combination of soap, water, and surface disinfectants identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to sanitize spaces for the COVID-19 virus. Vermund added that heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operations can also be adjusted or increased to spur great air circulation.“In the absence of an HVAC system in a building, strategic and well-planned outward-facing fans can be placed in windows to create a negative pressure area (as one sees in some kitchens and attics) that can decrease levels of virus in the air,” said Vermund. “Of course, mask use, physical distancing, hand/face/surface hygiene, outdoor activities, small crowds, and testing and contact tracing are all vital.”Though sage is not known to eliminate airborne bacteria or viruses, the herb has been shown to contain antiseptic properties that are beneficial to human health. Previous research has found that sage mouthwash effectively reduced the number of mouth bacteria and may work as an effective treatment for certain mental health conditions, diabetes, and cancer. Further studies have shown that sage includes anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, among other health benefits."	false
520	A lucky bargain hunter became a millionaire after finding an original print of the Declaration of Independence in the frame of an old painting.	"Urban legendry includes numerous ""windfall"" tales involving fortuitous discoveries of seemingly ordinary objects that proved to be extraordinarily valuable. (See our King of the Rode article for one example.)Every now and then one of these windfall things turns out to be for real, however.In 1989, a Philadelphia financial analyst bought an old painting (a depiction of a country scene) for $4 at a flea market in Adamstown, Pennsylvania, mostly because he liked the frame. He liked it even more once he found that the painting housed a rare and valuable document.The buyer was investigating a tear in the canvas, and the frame fell apart in his hands when he attempted to detach it from the painting, leading him to discover a folded document that appeared to be an old copy of the Declaration of Independence stored between the canvas and its wood backing. After a friend who collected Civil War memorabilia advised him to have it appraised, he learned that the document was in fact a rare original Dunlap broadside, one of 500 official copies from the first printing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Only 23 similar copies were known to exist before this find, of which a mere two were privately owned:This rare document was offered for sale by Sotheby's on 4 June 1991, and the lucky find fetched even more than had been anticipated: the $800,000 to $1.2 million estimate turned into a $2.42 million sale by the sound of the gavel:""This was a record for any printed Americana,"" said David Redden, the auctioneer, who is a senior vice president at Sotheby's in Manhattan. ""It was far and away the highest price for historical Americana ever.""The copy sold [by Sotheby's] is a crisp, clean broadside, creased along lines where it had been folded. It was printed by John Dunlap on July 4, 1776, to carry news of America's independence to the citizens of the 13 colonies. It is one of 24 known copies of the Declaration, and one of only three remaining in private hands.The previous owner, who was not identified, had told Sotheby's he bought a torn painting for $4 in a flea market in Adamstown, Pa., because he was interested in its frame. When he got home, he said, he removed the painting — a dismal country scene — and concluded the frame could not be salvaged, but found the Declaration, folded and hidden in the backing. He showed it to Sotheby's experts earlier this year.Mr. Redden said he thought the man would be ""rather stunned"" to learn the price it had brought.This charming story was later turned to a commercial purpose: In the autumn of 1997, SunAmerica ran television commercials based on the original finder's tale, utilizing the theme that you could either hope to get lucky like he did, or you could work out an investment plan with SunAmerica.This document was put up for sale again in June 2000, fetching an $8.14 million bid from television producer Norman Lear in an online auction. It then became the centerpiece of the Norman Lear Center's Declaration of Independence Road Trip, which took it on a three-and-a-half year cross-country tour:The goal of the project was to bring the ""People's Document"" directly to all Americans — especially young people — to inspire them to see citizenship as an opportunity; to participate in civic life; to exercise their rights; and above all, to vote. As the Road Trip traveled to cities and towns across the United States, it creatively combined elements of education, entertainment, and community outreach.When TV producer and philanthropist Norman Lear learned that the Dunlap broadside would be auctioned, he saw it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring it to the American people. Lear purchased it and development of the project now known as the Declaration of Independence Road Trip began.March 2006 saw a smaller-scale repetition of this experience when Michael Sparks was browsing a thrift shop in Nashville, Tennessee, and happened upon a yellowed, shellacked, rolled-up document. Learning from a clerk that the item could be had for a mere $2.48, Sparks purchased it, took it home, and after doing some online research eventually learned that he had bought one of 200 ""official copies"" of the Declaration of Independence commissioned by John Quincy Adams in 1820. He spent nearly a year authenticating and conserving the document before selling it at auction in March 2007, where it fetched $477,650.After Michael Sparks' lucky find made the news in February 2007, Stan Caffy contacted reporter Mary Hance of the Tennessean and claimed that he was the one who had (unwittingly) donated the valuable document to the Music City Thrift store in March 2006:""I bought it at a yard sale in Donelson about 10 years, ago, in Donelson Hills, I think,"" said Stan Caffy, a pipe fitter.For years, the document hung in Stan Caffy's garage, where he works on bicycles as a hobby.He married his wife, Linda, a little more than a year ago. As part of the ritual of combining households, she pushed him to clean out the garage, which had filled up with all sorts of extraneous things.""I used to be a packrat but now I am trying to get rid of things. The best I can recall, we had a little debate about whether to keep it (the Declaration) or donate it and she won.""And so it was that Linda took the Declaration along with a pile of other stuff — an antique table, a shower massage head, and a faucet — to donate to the Music City Thrift store last March."	true
3190	Supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump got refunds after his campaign billed them repeatedly when they meant to make one-time donations.	"In early April 2021, Snopes readers asked about social media posts and memes that claimed that former U.S. President Donald Trump ""tricked"" them into making recurring campaign donations. For instance, one such meme said contributors to the campaign who though they were making a one-time donation ""were unaware the fine print stated they would be billed the same amount every single week until election day."" In many cases, these claims are rather exaggerated, mean-spirited takes on a New York Times story, as we will explain below. As we previously reported, it's true that the Trump campaign was soliciting recurring donations with a pre-checked box, even after the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election. It's also true that many Trump supporters demanded refunds from the Trump campaign, although it seems mathematically impossible that the number of people who requested refunds was in the millions (as was claimed in social media posts).The April 3 Times report details the experience of Trump donor Stacy Blatt, a retiree who was in hospice care, suffering from cancer, when he discovered his bank account depleted from those recurring donations.Stacy Blatt was in hospice care last September listening to Rush Limbaugh’s dire warnings about how badly Donald J. Trump’s campaign needed money when he went online and chipped in everything he could: $500.It was a big sum for a 63-year-old battling cancer and living in Kansas City on less than $1,000 per month. But that single contribution — federal records show it was his first ever — quickly multiplied. Another $500 was withdrawn the next day, then $500 the next week and every week through mid-October, without his knowledge — until Mr. Blatt’s bank account had been depleted and frozen. When his utility and rent payments bounced, he called his brother, Russell, for help.What the Blatts soon discovered was $3,000 in withdrawals by the Trump campaign in less than 30 days. They called their bank and said they thought they were victims of fraud.Contrary to the takes offered in partisan memes and posts, Blatt and others like him were not ""low IQ,"" but instead, fell victim to the complicated and evolving wording in a pre-checked box on Trump's online donation portal, according to the Times. As a result, the Times reported, the Trump campaign and WinRed, a for-profit company that processed the online donations, were forced to issue $122 million in campaign contribution refunds to people like Blatt.As Election Day neared in November 2020, the Times report described what amounted to a sense of panic that cropped up inside the Trump campaign, as Democrats out-raised and spent them. During that time, the text on the online donation portal for Trump's donation website changed from simply asking donors to make donations a monthly gift, to including a pre-checked box with more complicated text that made donations weekly.As the election drew closer, text in that bright yellow box went from containing a pre-checked field that in March 2020 simply said, ""Make this a monthly recurring donation,"" to more complicated and emphatic demands by late 2020 that contained fake ultimatums. As of Sept. 30, 2020, the box looked like this:As the pre-checked box evolved, the result was an increase in refunds issued to donors who had missed the finer print in the box that allowed the refunds to be weekly recurring. The refunds issued by the Trump campaign outpaced and dwarfed the $21 million in refunds issued by his political rival, now-U.S. President Joe Biden. The effect can be seen in a graph posted by Shane Goldmacher, the Times report's author:The evolution of the text in the box on Trump's online donation portal can be viewed by clicking on various dates via the Internet Archive.A search for Blatt's name can be found on OpenSecrets.org, a campaign finance transparency tool run by the nonpartisan organization Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. It confirms the Times reporting that Blatt, who listed himself as retired, was billed $500 multiple times by the Trump campaign between mid-September and October 11, 2020. Sadly, Blatt died of cancer in February 2021, according to the Times.We sent emails to WinRed and the Trump campaign seeking comment, but didn't get an answer in time for publication. We will update if we do. But we note that in their public statements responding to the Times story that neither Trump nor WinRed refute the financial figures or facts laid out by the Times. Instead, the stance taken by both WinRed and Trump is that the Times' report was unfairly negative about their approach to fundraising.In a series of tweets, WinRed called the Times report a ""hit piece"" and said WinRed's practices were comparable to that of ActBlue, the fundraising portal that serves Democratic candidates. ""So when Republicans do it to stay competitive, it’s nefarious, and when Dems - who created the technology - do it, it’s a 'platform for little experiments that gently squeeze even more money out of donors,'"" WinRed tweeted.In a statement responding to the report, Trump referenced his pre- and post-election disinformation campaign, namely false claims that the 2020 election was beset by a massive-scale voter fraud conspiracy. Like WinRed, Trump said his own fundraising efforts were based on those of ActBlue, and also like WinRed, he claimed that the percentage of donors who formally disputed the charges with their financial institutions was low:We learned from liberal ActBlue — and now we’re better than they are! In fact, many people were so enthusiastic that they gave over and over, and in certain cases where they would give too much, we would promptly refund their contributions. Our overall dispute rate was less than 1% of total online donations, a very low number. This is done by Dems alsoThe Times story reported that WinRed ""typically granted [refunds] to avoid more costly formal disputes."" It also pointed out that while WinRed is a for-profit company, ActBlue is a non-profit organization. As such, WinRed ""makes its money by taking 30 cents of every donation, plus 3.8 percent of the amount given. WinRed was paid more than $118 million from federal committees the last election cycle; even after paying credit card fees and expenses like payroll and rent, the profits are believed to be significant.""We reached out to ActBlue for a response to WinRed and Trump's comments. A spokesperson told us by email that the average contribution amount across the platform in 2019-2020 was $38.08. The spokesperson also referred to this portion of the Times report that included a statement by ActBlue:ActBlue said in a statement that it had begun to phase out prechecked recurring boxes “unless groups were explicitly asking for recurring contributions.” Some prominent Democratic groups, including both congressional campaign committees, continue to precheck recurring boxes regardless of that guidance. Still, Democratic refund rates were only a small fraction of the Trump campaign’s last year.On April 7, 2021, Timothy Miller, a writer for the political news site The Bulwark, tweeted that he received a fundraising text from the National Republican Congressional Committee with a similar, pre-checked fundraising box:"	true
5481	American Muslim groups raised more than $190,000 to benefit victims of the mass shooting attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue.	"In the wake of an October 2018 mass shooting attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left eleven worshipers dead, both news and social media platforms picked up on a show of solidarity extended to the survivors on the part of two Muslim groups.On 30 October 2018, the liberal Facebook group The Other 98% shared a photograph of two men hanging a Star of David for Irving Younger, one of the victims of the attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue three days earlier, along with the caption ""Muslim Americans raise more than $190,000 for those affected by Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. This is what makes America great"":In this case, the meme was correct: As of 1 November 2018, the Muslims Unite for Pittsburgh Synagogue fundraising campaign had raised over $227,000, dwarfing their initial fundraising goal of $25,000. The campaign was organized by two Muslim community groups, MPowerChange and CelebrateMercy, as described on the fundraiser's web site:
In a campaign organized by CelebrateMercy and MPower Change, the Muslim-American community extends its hands to help the shooting victims, whether it is the injured victims or the Jewish families who have lost loved ones.We wish to respond to evil with good, as our faith instructs us, and send a powerful message of compassion through action. Our Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: ""Show mercy to those on earth, and the One in the Heavens will show mercy to you."" The Quran also teaches us to ""Repel evil by that which is better.""
On 30 October 2018, the groups updated the fundraiser to note that they had transferred $25,000 to the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, which had met with officials ""to begin planning fund disbursement to the victims' families.""  On 1 November, they reported another $110,000 had been disbursed.Eleven people were killed in the shooting. The suspect, a 46-year-old Pennsylvania man, had a history of spewing anti-Semitic rhetoric online, including promoting the conspiracy theory that Jewish people were helping immigrants from Central America, whom he called ""invaders,"" make their way to the United States. The day of the shooting, he posted on the right-wing social media site Gab to say that he ""can't sit by and watch [his] people get slaughtered,"" adding, ""Screw your optics, I'm going in."""	true

In April 2020, as the death toll in the United States from the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic topped 30,000, an image gained traction on social media that supposedly showed a screenshot of an old tweet from now-U.S. President Donald Trump.

As President, ALL responsibility becomes yours during a crisis like this, whether or not you're entirely to blame. John McCain, and for that matter myself, would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office.This is not a genuine tweet from Trump in November 2009, some seven years before he became president. The tweet does not appear on Trump's timeline, nor is it included in the Trump Twitter Archive or Fact Base's archive of deleted tweets.

5784	A.A. Milne created the animal characters in 'Winnie-the-Pooh' to represent various mental disorders.	"In August 2018, coincident with the release of the Disney film Christopher Robin, a new generation of Winnie the Pooh fans were exposed to a popular theory holding that the animal characters who populate the Hundred Acre Wood in A.A. Milne's most famous works were created to represent various mental disorders:Like similar theories positing that the seven characters on the sitcom Gilligan's Island personified the seven deadly sins, or that the five main characters in the animated children's show Scooby-Doo were each based on one of five eastern colleges, the notion that characters such as Eeyore, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, and even Pooh himself represent various mental disorders is a fanciful latter-day interpretation and not an expression of the authorial intent of Pooh creator A.A. Milne.This theory was first popularized in a tongue-in-cheek paper published in 2000 (more than 70 years after the appearance of the first Winnie-the-Pooh book) in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.The BBC reported at the time that lead researcher and primary author Sarah Shea's intention was to ""remind people that anyone can have disorders."" The introduction to the study also noted that the characters were diagnosed with different mental disorders by a ""group of modern neurodevelopmentalists,"" not Milne:On the surface it is an innocent world: Christopher Robin, living in a beautiful forest surrounded by his loyal animal friends. Generations of readers of A.A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories have enjoyed these seemingly benign tales. However, perspectives change with time, and it is clear to our group of modern neurodevelopmentalists that these are in fact stories of Seriously Troubled Individuals, many of whom meet DSM-IV3 criteria for significant disorders (Table 1). We have done an exhaustive review of the works of A.A. Milne and offer our conclusions about the inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood in hopes that our observations will help the medical community understand that there is a Dark Underside to this world."	false
2674	The hacker group Anonymous took down the Texas Republican Party's website.	"Activists from the hacker collective Anonymous took down the website of the Texas Republican Party in protest against a restrictive law that has the effect of banning most abortions.The law, SB8, which took effect on Sept. 1, 2021, bans abortions at about six weeks. The enforcement mechanism laid out in the law allows any private citizen to sue ""any person"" who performs such abortions, or ""aids or abets"" them.The law blocks access to an estimated 85 to 90% of medical system-provided abortion services, and provides no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest.The law was overwhelmingly backed by Texas Republicans and signed by the state's Republican governor, Greg Abbott. In response, Anonymous announced a campaign, dubbed ""Operation Jane,"" to render data collected in efforts to report abortions useless.As part of that campaign, Anonymous hackers took down the Texas GOP's website and replaced it with, among other things, an X-rated image of a man stretching out his anus. (There is an archived version of the hacked website, but view with caution: It is graphic.) Hackers also replaced the state GOP's mission statement with one that read, in part, ""WE REALLY REALLY LOVED THE HANDMAID'S TALE AND WISH TO ENACT IT TO IT'S FULLEST. FOOTBALL!!!!!!""Texas Republicans acknowledged the vandalism with a statement on their website claiming it prompted them to ramp up their online security. The statement was accompanied by fields allowing website visitors to enter their payment card information and make a donation. The statement reads, in part, ""Stand with us now against these cyber criminals and their brazen attacks by rushing a contribution to harden our digital defenses.""Just days after the law went into effect, a website launched by the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life which was intended for reporting abortions that violated the new law was taken offline by domain host GoDaddy after a public pressure campaign.Anonymous is a loose collective of, as the name states, anonymous cyber activists who emerged in the late aughts to support popular protest movements like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street. They are known for making ominous videos addressed to their hacking targets ending with the phrase, ""Expect us,"" and wearing Guy Fawkes masks to conceal their identities."	true
6322	Dr. Bandy Lee, who has warned the United States that Donald Trump is dangerously impaired, lacks a medical license.	"On 10 January 2018, an article posted to the web site of white supremacist online radio host Hal Turner reported — falsely — that Dr. Bandy Lee, a renowned psychiatrist and violence expert at Yale University who has been vocal about her views on the deleterious societal effects of President Donald Trump's mental state and presidency, did not have a medical license:For months, a woman purporting to be an expert in Psychiatry, has been unethically remotely diagnosing President Donald Trump, and has also been unethically publicly claiming he is emotionally unstable and thus unfit to be President. But a quick look into Dr. Bandy Lee shows she doesn't have a License to practice!As proof of this claim, Turner posted a screen shot from a Connecticut professional license database along with triumphal text boasting his purported discovery that Lee's physician's license had ""lapsed"":Medical doctors are required to be licensed by the states they practice in, and some maintain multiple licenses. So it wouldn't be far-fetched to think that, even if Dr. Lee did not have a current license in Connecticut, she might hold one in another state. Despite this likelihood, and the fact Hal Turner is a brazen white supremacist, similar articles raising doubts about the status of Dr. Lee's professional license also appeared on larger conservative web sites. First Campus Reform posted the story, splashing their proprietary watermark over the public record showing Lee's license as ""lapsed"" in Connecticut, and then the Daily Caller picked it up.Campus Reform, a right wing web site funded by the Leadership Institute, that trawls the Internet and social media for signs of perceived liberalism on college campuses, reported:Yale University psychology professor Bandy Lee has deleted her Twitter account amid mounting allegations that she is not licensed in her home state of Connecticut.Accusations have been circulating on Twitter that the prominent Yale professor, known for her public diagnosis of President Donald Trump as having a “mental impairment” and who recently met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss the issue, isn’t actually a licensed psychiatrist.Nonetheless, Dr. Lee does hold an active physician's license in the state of New York:In a phone interview, Dr. Lee told us that the explanation for her lapsed license in Connecticut is a simple one: she previously held medical licenses in three states — California, Connecticut, and New York. (She also held a license in France for five years while working for the Ministry of Justice there.) But because her work as a forensic psychiatrist specializing in violence has led her to perform mostly consultation and policy-oriented work, she decided that holding multiple state licences wasn't practical or necessary:I had been maintaining all three [state medical licenses], but it got to be a lot of work, so I decided for the consultation work I do that I don’t need a licensee in every state I consult in. I held New York, Connecticut and California for many years, but the Connecticut one I just let go of because in terms of maintenance you have to renew every year and it got cumbersome. In California you have to constantly update [Continued Medical Education]. I kept the New York license because it’s the easiest to maintain.Peter Fricke, editor of Campus Reform (a publication that claims to hold itself ""to rigorous journalism standards"") told us they published the story headlined ""Records show psych prof who 'diagnosed' Trump lacks license"" without all the relevant information one would expect in such an article because when they reached out to Dr. Lee, she didn't specify which state she was currently licensed in. Nevertheless, Fricke told us that he felt it was valuable to report Lee doesn't hold a current Connecticut license, because she is on the faculty at Yale (which is in New Haven):She works in Connecticut and she uses her affiliation with Yale University to give relevance to what she does. We haven’t said anything that’s untrue. We did independently verify the status of her license in Connecticut. We were made aware of her story because she had deleted her Twitter account in the wake of the fallout.Lee has become yet another focus of disreputable partisan web sites that help foster online hate from some supporters of President Donald Trump. She found herself in the spotlight most recently after Politico reported on 3 January 2018 that she had traveled to Capitol Hill one month earlier to warn lawmakers that President Trump's instability is a public danger, and that it will only get worse as time goes on. Lee also edited the October 2017 book The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President, and in mid-January 2018, she authored two op-eds in large publications delineating her concerns.Lee told us she deleted her Twitter account because after gaining the type of toxic, hyperpartisan attention that is now commonplace on social media, she started receiving death threats which caused her to be so fearful that she now wears a disguise whenever she steps outside.Aside from the political controversy, Lee and her cohort made intra-disciplinary waves on 9 January 2018, when the American Psychiatric Association put out a statement calling for an end to ""armchair"" psychiatry, saying doctors evaluating public figures they have not personally examined violates the ""Goldwater Rule,"" an ethical principle that ""guides physician members of the APA to refrain from publicly issuing professional medical opinions about individuals that they have not personally evaluated in a professional setting or context.""Lee told us despite this criticism, she feels it is in fact unethical for her to remain silent and that it is her professional duty to caution the public about what she and other experts see as a threat:The morning after the election, at 8 a.m. I was flooded with phone calls and emails, because I'm a well-known expert on violence. People were getting in touch because they were concerned about violence — and they were right. Now we have data that shows unprecedented spike in hate crimes since the day after the election that have not abated to this day. There have been increases in school yard bullying in the name of Trump and things he has said, and a rise in gun-related deaths since his campaign. So now we have tangible numbers to show they were right in their concerns.Silence allows harm just as much as active collusion. When [the medical community] sees signs of danger it's an emergency and we respond right away. But now we have enabled it to pervade our lives and create a malignant normality where if we start to speak out, we are attacked and people try and discredit us. I have faced considerable threats."	false

1231	"A large increase in the size of Social Security benefits provided to seniors occurring in 2023 came about ""through President Biden's leadership."""	"The official White House Twitter account credited the 2023 cost-of-living increase to ""Biden's leadership,"" though the tweet was later deleted.On Nov. 1, 2022, the official White House Twitter account suggested that an increase in the amount of money provided to seniors via Social Security benefits occurred ""through President Biden's leadership."" Several users on Twitter, including Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, Ky., took issue with the suggestion that specific actions taken by the Biden administration could have led to an increase in the value of these benefits, in large part because the adjustment to benefits ""is an automatic formula.""This critique, also spelled out beneath the White House tweet when it was flagged through the crowd-sourced misinformation Twitter initiative Birdwatch, is valid. In short, no action performed by the Biden administration could plausibly hold any direct bearing on the size of the increase in Social Security payments. This is because the amount of increase from year to year — as a result of a law passed 50 years before Biden took office — is directly tied to a standardized index. The White House deleted its tweet the following morning. Prior to 1975, the only way to adjust the size of Social Security payments was through an act of Congress. Without regular acts of Congress, then, the effective value of Social Security benefits would decline over time due to inflation. Beginning in 1975, thanks to legislation passed in 1972, the benefit size increased based on an automatic Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).The CPI is calculated each month by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and ""represents changes in prices of all goods and services purchased for consumption by urban households."" Their data come from ""75 urban areas throughout the country, "" from ""about 23,000 retail and service establishments,"" and also from a survey on rent prices collected from around 50,000 landlords or tenants.""The COLA update for 2023 is 8.7%, which makes it the fourth-largest increase since COLAs were introduced. The three higher adjustments occurred in 1980 (14.3%), 1981 (11.2%), and 1979 (9.9%) Such adjustments are standardized, and the causes of inflation are myriad, complex, and — at least in part — international in nature. As a result, the assertion by the Biden White House that its leadership was responsible for larger Social Security payments to seniors in 2023 is untenable."	false

On Dec. 21 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. Its aim was to merge a COVID-19 relief bill with the annual appropriations bill that allocates funds for the federal government. For COVID-19 relief, the bill authorized a one-time payment of $600 to most Americans — an amount criticized as inadequate compared to the economic suffering it seeks to mitigate.One popular tweet expressing this frustration asserted that each member of ""Congress made almost $100,000 during the time they were arguing whether or not we deserved $600.""The veracity of this statement depends at least in part on how the assertion is specifically defined, but in general it is factually defensible. Members of Congress — both senators and representatives — each get paid $174,000 per year. What remains to be defined is the amount of time they spent ""arguing"" over the bill that provided a $600 stimulus check.In our view, it is fair to say that the fight for a second stimulus check began the moment after the CARES Act (which included authorization of a $1200 stimulus payment) was signed into law on March 27, 2020. There was bipartisan recognition that this massive spending bill would be insufficient to combat the economic problems caused by COVID-19. ""The minute we’re done with phase three,"" Senate Republican Policy Committee Chairman Roy Blunt said to The Hill on March 27, referring to the CARES act, ""we’ll start talking about phase four because all of us know that phase three can’t have included everything that needs to be included.” For Democrats, this explicitly included a desire for further direct payments to individual American citizens. Even before CARES officially became law, on March 25, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN, ""We'll get more direct payments in another bill.""The ""fight"" over these direct payments, then, started as the first checks were authorized. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 was approved and sent to the president for his signature (or potential veto) on Dec. 21, 2020.Using these endpoints, the period of time ""during"" which this debate occurred would be 269 days. This represents 74% of the year. The most straightforward solution to the question would be to take 74% of the annual $174,000 salary.

2367	The rapid appearance of books about the COVID-19 omicron variant is proof that the pandemic was planned.	"While a number of self-published books appeared on Amazon shortly after the omicron variant emerged, this isn't proof the pandemic was ""planned."" Rather, it is proof of just how easy it is to self-publish a shoddily researched book. Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

In December 2021, a number of social media users expressed confusion and skepticism over a series of books that had been published on Amazon about the new COVID-19 omicron variant. How was it possible, these people wondered, for someone to research, write, and publish a book about a strain of COVID-19 that had been discovered just days or weeks earlier. Other social media users commented:How can there be so many books knowing all about the #Omicron variant when we only found out about it 2 weeks ago?Amazing how there are 30 books available on Amazon on the Omicron variant when it was just named Nov 26,this one in particular was published on that date…..almost like it was plannedGo to Amazon and search ""Understanding Omicron Variant"" How can scientists do any kind of reputable work, write a book, have it peer reviewed, have it proofed, published AND printed in a couple WEEKS? Can you say scam?There are truly a number of books on Amazon about the omicron variant that were published within days of the announcement by the World Health Organization (WHO) that the new strain had been identified. This isn't proof that the pandemic was ""planned,"" or that it is a ""scam."" Rather, it's proof of just how quick and easy it is to self-publish a book on Amazon. Self-publishing authors can submit their books to Amazon in as little as 5 minutes and can see their books up for sale the following day. The social media users quoted above all expressed skepticism that a book about something as complicated as the omicron variant could be researched, written, and edited in a span of just a few days. This skepticism is rightfully placed. The omicron variant books on Amazon that were published in December 2021 likely did not go through rigorous research, writing, or editing phases.Unlike a scholarly journal where material has to go though peer review, anybody can self-publish just about anything on Amazon. The material can contain an infinite amount of typos (no editing), the content doesn't have to be factual (no research), and in some cases the text can be artificially generated or plagiarized (no writing). In other words, just because a book exists on Amazon doesn't mean its content is worth reading.  In March 2020, near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon was flooded with self-published books about the illness. These books were shoddily put together and often contained plagiarized content. The Guardian reported:As the coronavirus spreads around the world, it is not only health professionals and politicians who are being kept busy. Amazon has been flooded with badly put together, often plagiarised “guides” to combatting the virus.The retailing giant has already been removing “tens of thousands” of listings from “bad actors” attempting to artificially raise prices on items such as face masks and hand sanitiser. Now it is fighting a losing battle against the writers rushing out self-published books to profit from coronavirus fears. Generally shorter than 100 pages, dozens have been published in the last few weeks, promising worried readers ways to prevent or avoid the virus.On Amazon.co.uk on Thursday morning, the top results returned for books about coronavirus included Corbi Yang’s Coronavirus, which promised to answer “how this virus was identified and what measures have been taken up till now”. Running to 44 pages, much of the writing was lifted directly from web pages.While social media users were skeptical of the rash of books published on Amazon about the omicron variant, there was one title that drew special attention. According to social media posts, a book by ""Dr. Teresa Bishop"" titled ""UNDERSTANDING OMICRON VARIANT: All You Need To Know About Omicron Variant, Where It Comes From, Answers To Questions You Have, And Lots More Update To Keep You Well Informed"" was copyrighted in 2020, nearly a year before the omicron variant emerged. How was this possible? How was a book about the omicron variant copyrighted before the emergence of the omicron variant? We reached out to Amazon for some specifics about this title and we will update this article if more information becomes available. For the moment, here's what we know:"	false
5395	Jack and Rosie Riddle were photographed in 1948 accepting a radio from a group of Ku Klux Klan members.	"A photograph dating from 1948 depicting an apparent show of ""charity"" on the part of the Ku Klux Klan towards an elderly black couple in Alabama continues to circulate online, although details behind the actual encounter are sparse.The photograph shows 106-year-old Jack Riddle and his wife, Rosie, both former slaves, seated in front of a group of Klansmen (including one dressed as Santa Claus), flanking a radio the group had reportedly given to the couple as a gift:The image, which was published in newspapers in California and Pennsylvania (among other states), has resurfaced periodically on social media platforms, although it is typically accompanied by little in the way of information about how and why the Klansmen approached the Riddles with their ""gift."" John Giggie, an associate professor of history at the University of Alabama, told us that the photograph is ""the type of image that Klan members would dream of"" at the time:
It captures the Klan fantasy of returning to a time when black Americans were enslaved and white Americans could lord over them with impunity. The given year of the image is important -- 1948 -- as it marks the emergence of the Dixiecrats, who left the Democratic Party in 1948 over its rising interest in civil rights. In that context, the photo functions as a warning to blacks and those who would support them in their freedom struggle.
Giggie added that the photograph also ""screams hyperbole"":
The idea of former slaves literally clasping the hands of a Klansmen – dressed as Santa Claus, no less -- and sitting next to a radio seems to create a studied photo in which the Klan is merging examples of American modernity with those of its enslaved past. There is also the nagging sense that this is simply an absurd parody of Klan bravado. The idea of former slaves sitting with Klansmen seems to at least suggest a mockery of Klan pretensions of power and acceptance.
Time magazine also published a brief item about the pictured meeting on 3 January 1949 under the heading ""Manners and Morals:""
In Talladega, Ala., a white-hooded delegation of Ku Kluxers and a white-bearded Santa Claus presented a radio to Jack Riddle, a 107-year-old Negro and his wife, Josey, 86, so they could have their wish, to ""hear the preachers."" Grand Dragon Samuel Green explained that this demonstrated the ""heart of a Klansman,"" called in photographers to take the most incongruous picture of the week.
A separate photograph of the encounter was collected in the book From the Picture Press, published by the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1973:The museum's caption for the photograph stated that Green and his cohorts ""publicized the 'good will' visit ten days before it occurred.""However, at least one related clipping posted online has, at the very least, been misattributed. Some blog posts concerning the Riddles' photograph cite a brief op-ed attributed to the Milwaukee Journal newspaper on 26 December 1948:Because the klan's professions and practices vary so much, we suggest that northerners maintain a healthy skepticism about any regeneration of the klan. It will take more than pretty words, and a few gifts to Negroes, to wipe out the record of terror, intimidation and violence that has been synonymous with the name klan.And as for that radio gift to Jack Riddle, the klan's good will toward the Negro will be more convincing when it is concerned with the welfare, the education and the civil rights of all Negroes. The problem of Jack Riddle not having a radio set is only a very small part of the over-all picture of the Negro in the south.In 1995, the Journal merged with the Milwaukee Sentinel to become the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. When we contacted that successor newspaper regarding the 1948 clipping, assistant managing editor for visual journalism Sherman Williams told us that ""This article does not appear in the 12/26/48 edition of The Milwaukee Journal. The article does not match the typography or style of the newspaper then.""The photograph was also copyrighted by Getty Images, who told us that it was originally shot by a photographer from the Keystone Press Agency. At least two phone numbers listed under that name are invalid, while emails sent to addresses listed under Keystone did not produce responses prior to publication."	true
4745	The Keystone Pipeline in North Dakota was shut down after it leaked oil.	"The Keystone pipeline leaked an estimated 9,120 barrels of oil, or roughly 383,000 gallons, in North Dakota in late October 2019 before it was shut down as a result of the leak, according to TC Energy, the company that operates the pipeline.Readers asked Snopes if the story was true after they saw a headline from the conspiracy site The Mind Unleashed circulating on social media. The headline, published on Oct. 30, 2019, read  ""Keystone Pipeline Shut Down After Leaking Oil in North Dakota and Nobody’s Talking About It."" Ironically, even as The Mind Unleashed reported ""nobody"" was talking about the spill, the entirety of its story was sourced from a report by the Associated Press.The leak was also reported on by The New York Times, which noted that the pipeline in question wasn't the controversial Keystone XL, although the two are operated by the same company:Tuesday’s leak occurred along a stretch of the existing Keystone pipeline system, not the 1,179-mile addition to that system known as the Keystone XL pipeline, he [Karl Rockeman, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality’s division of water quality] said. Keystone XL has been the subject of environmental protests for years. President Barack Obama denied it a permit in 2015, but just days after taking office [in 2017], President Trump cleared a path for its operator, formerly known as TransCanada, to proceed.This is the second major incident for the pipeline system in the last two years. In 2017, a spill coated a stretch of grassland in South Dakota with more than 407,000 gallons of leaked Canadian crude oil, which was nearly twice as much as originally estimated, according to the company. The pipeline also leaked about 16,000 gallons each in spills in 2011 in North Dakota and in 2016 in South Dakota.The leak was detected on Oct. 29, 2019, according to a statement released by TC Energy, prompting the company to begin shutting down the pipeline. Public officials identify the affected area as a rural wetland in Walsh County, which is in northeast North Dakota, near the Minnesota border.The spill occurred about three miles northwest of the small city of Edinburg, but officials said said there's no indication the spill contaminated drinking water. Karl Rockeman, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality’s division of water quality, told the Times that the spill is ""one of the larger spills in the state.""In an email to Snopes, Rockeman said that no impacts on public health occurred as a result of the spill, and that on the surface, the spill has been contained. A ""subsurface investigation is continuing,"" Rockeman added.Although the pipeline is separate from the Dakota Access Pipeline, which drew a year-long, impassioned protest from the Standing Rock Sioux and environmental activists, the Keystone leak drew anger from advocates who say the pipelines present an ongoing environmental and public health hazard because of the demonstrated danger of leaks.The Keystone pipeline just spilled AGAIN** — and is now the 8th largest pipeline oil spill in the past decade. ??**Brought to you by the corporation that wants to build the much larger #KXL pipeline and have it cut right through the Midwest... https://t.co/gHXxIC12Sw #NoKXL— Greenpeace USA (@greenpeaceusa) October 31, 2019This is the third spill along the Keystone pipeline's route in less than three years.

3106	Courteney Ross, George Floyd's former girlfriend, taught Daunte Wright — a 20-year-old Black man who was killed by a white Minnesota police officer on April 11, 2021.	"Wright attended Minneapolis' Edison High School when Ross was employed there as a teaching assistant and counselor, and she told journalists after his death that she knew him. The exact circumstances under which Ross and Wright interacted at the school and the duration of their working relationship were not known, however.On April 13, 2021, the loved ones of two Black men killed by white Minnesota police officers -- 20-year-old Daunte Wright and 46-year-old George Floyd -- held a news conference in downtown Minneapolis, near the building of former police officer Derek Chauvin's murder trial. After the media event, rumors surfaced claiming a connection between the families beyond the circumstances of Wright's and Floyd's deaths. Social media posts asserted Floyd's girlfriend at the time of his death, Courteney Ross, once taught the younger victim at Edison High School in northeast Minneapolis.The public school is about 10 miles southeast from where authorities say a suburban police officer mistook her handgun for a taser and fatally shot Wright on April 11, and roughly seven miles north from where Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck before he died less than one year prior.The crux of the claim was true. However, the circumstances under which Ross interacted with Wright at the high school and the duration of their working relationship were not known.Let us unpack that conclusion. First, we confirmed via Ross' interviews with journalists, as well as her testimony during Chauvin's trial, that she recently dated Floyd. For instance, she told a neighborhood news outlet, the Northeaster Newspaper, that she met Floyd at a local Salvation Army in 2017, fell in love with him immediately, and told him ""I love you"" hours before his death. “I have Floyd and the world has George Floyd,” Ross said in that interview.Next, we considered her alleged connection to Wright, who was killed in the neighboring suburb of Brooklyn Center, a town of roughly 30,000 people on Minneapolis' northwest border.At the news conference near Minneapolis' Hennepin County Government Center, Wright's aunt, Naisha Wright, indeed said Ross (who was present at the media event) was her nephew's teacher. Here's the aunt's full quote, verbatim, according to video recordings of the event:""The craziest thing is to find out today that my family has connections to this man, to this family,"" she said of Floyd's social circle. ""His girlfriend was a teacher for my nephew. My nephew was a lovable young man. His smile, oh lord, the most beautiful smile. Ya'll took that.""Later that day, Ross said, according to The Associated Press: ""(I’m) crushed. It’s enough that Floyd is gone, but for one of my youths to be gone as well.“He was just a wonderful, beautiful boy,” she added.Following those statements, The Washington Post interviewed Ross to learn more about how she knew Wright. She told that news outlet he indeed was a student of Edison High School (The Associated Press also confirmed that detail of Wright's biography) when she worked there, and that he was a gregarious young person who was well-known throughout the community. That article continued:""She was not particularly close to him, but said she last saw him being confronted by police on the corner in Brooklyn Center in the summer of 2019. She said she was walking with Floyd when she saw the incident.""Jonathan Mason, who worked as a youth development specialist at Edison High School and also knew Wright, confirmed with journalists that Ross was a teacher's assistant and counselor there. Snopes reached out to district officials to learn when, exactly, Ross worked at Edison High School, what her purported role entailed, and when Wright was a student -- questions that would help discern how often, or under what circumstances, they crossed paths. We have not received responses, but we will update this report when, or if, we do. (She was not listed as a staff member or administrator on the school's website, as of this writing.)Wright attended two other Minneapolis high schools, in addition to Edison, according to an Associated Press story in which educators discussed their experiences with him. His father, Aubrey Wright, told reporters he eventually dropped out of school because of a learning disability and, after that, worked in retail and fast-food restaurants to support his 2-year-old son."	true
6272	"A teaser trailer was released for a ""Friends"" movie."	"Fans of the show Friends have been clamoring for a reunion for years. So it isn't hard to see why a faux trailer purportedly showing clips from an upcoming Friends movie managed to fool so many viewers when it went viral in January 2018:This is not a genuine trailer for a new Friends movie. Smasher, a YouTube channel that makes ""concept trailers"" among other videos, uploaded the trailer on 12 January 2018, calling it a ""teaser trailer concept"" for a ""Jennifer Aniston Friends Reunion Concept.""Smasher made the trailer with clips from projects that Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer have appeared in since Friends went off the air in 2004. For instance, The scene featuring Kudrow as a doctor and Cox as is from an episode of the show Cougar Town, and the clip of Schwimmer and Kudrow talking via Skype was taken from the show Web Therapy. The clip of LeBlanc winning an award shows the actor's actual acceptance speech at the 2012 Golden Globes.As of this writing, no member from the cast of Friends has commented on this fan-made movie trailer. But judging from Kudrow's response from the last time there was talk of a reunion, fans shouldn't hold their breath for new episodes of the hit show:""It would be great [if it happened]. It would be a lot of fun. But even just from a logistical purpose, it would never work because everyone is on a totally, ridiculous work schedule, that's the opposite of someone else."	false

"A video claiming to show Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with cocaine on his desk during a video call with billionaire Elon Musk went viral in spring 2022, but the footage was clearly doctored. The video was shared from numerous Russian-language sites and blogs, and on Telegram, in late April. It showed Zelenskyy speaking to the Tesla CEO and one other person over video chat. Next to the Ukrainian president's hand, which was placed on the desk, was a pile of white powder and what appeared to be a credit card. One headline (translated from Google) stated, ""Zelensky Caught Again With Cocaine On The Table.""Here's an example of a Telegram post with the video, as well as a tweet.The digitally manipulated footage was created by using a genuine video of Zelenskyy in a video call with the pair. That authentic footage was posted to Zelenskyy's Instagram account in March 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine was in its early stages. In the call, Zelenskyy invited Musk to Ukraine ""after the war.""[Also on Snopes: Yes, Elon Musk Sent Starlink Terminals to Ukraine, But at What Safety Cost?]The same clip was posted on the BBC's website, as well, without any indication of cocaine or a credit card.Many people online compared that authentic footage with the edited version, pointing out the discrepancy.The Associated Press also pointed out the differences, saying, in the edited video, the credit card did not look 3-dimensional and the reflection from the light on the desk was still visible through the card as the camera moved over it."	false

However, none of those sources mentioned the use of a ""tactical nuke"":A missile attack on government outposts in northern Syria killed more than a dozen pro-government fighters, many of them Iranians, a war monitoring group and an Iranian news agency said [on 30 April 2018].

The [29 April 2018] night strikes sparked speculation on who carried it out, with most reports suspecting Israel was behind it.Syrian state TV called it a “new aggression on military positions” in Hama and Aleppo provinces but was not specific. Activists said there was a spectacular explosion at an arms depot and military compounds where Iranian fighters are based. The explosion was large enough to be picked up by monitors as a magnitude 2.6 earthquake.The Syrian state news agency SANA did report a ""hostile [rocket]"" attack had occurred in that country, but their report also made no mention of any nuclear detonation:
Syrian state media say an overnight missile attack in the country's northern region has killed 26 pro-government fighters, mostly Iranians.The Syrian news agency SANA on April 30 quoted a military source as saying positions in the provinces of Hama and Aleppo had been ""subjected to a new aggression with hostile missiles.""The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, says the attack appears to have been carried out by Israel and that it also targeted an arms depot for surface-to-surface missiles at a base in northern Syria known as Brigade 47. The Observatory says four Syrians were also among casualties.

455	The Wright brothers took flight for the first time the same year The New York Times published an editorial speculating it could take 1 to 10 million years to develop a successful flying machine.	"For years, social media posts have claimed that the Wright Brothers took flight for the first time the same year The New York Times published an article about it potentially taking 10 million years to develop a successful flying machine. The brothers are credited with inventing the airplane and making the first successful airplane flight in 1903.The alleged amount of time between the Times article being published and the Wright brothers taking flight varied according to the particular post. The first notable post we found related to the claim was a TikTok video from Sept. 7, 2021. It was posted by Cleo Abram, a video journalist who formerly worked for Vox. As of the date this fact check was published, it had over 100,000 views: In the video, Abram said two months passed between the article being published and the Wright Brothers' flight.The topic reappeared in May 2023, when a Twitter post claimed the amount of time between the article being published and the flight was nine days. ""An article published by The New York Times dated December 8th, 1903,"" it said. ""9 days later the Wright Brothers had their first flight."" An article published by The New York Times dated December 8th, 19039 days later the Wright Brothers had their first flight. pic.twitter.com/U64XJouGcC— Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) May 12, 2023At the time of publication, the tweet — to which Twitter owner Elon Musk replied — had 22,000 likes. We also found less viral posts making the claim on social media platforms, such as a 2019 Reddit post in the r/todayilearned subreddit. That post claimed the time gap between the article and the flight was one week. The Times published an editorial article on Oct. 9, 1903, with the headline, ""Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly."" We found the article using the Times' website's TImesMachine feature, which included page scans of issues from 1851 to 2002. The editorial was published two days after aviation pioneer Samuel P. Langley failed to launch his own airplane on Oct. 7, 1903.The editorial said:The machine does only what it must do in obedience to natural laws acting on passive matter. Hence, if it requires, say, a thousand years to fit for easy flight a bird which started with rudimentary wings, or ten thousand for one which started with no wings at all and had to sprout them ab initio, it might be assumed that the flying machine which will really fly might be evolved by the combined and continuous efforts of mathematicians and mechanicians in from one million to ten million years — provided, of course, we can meanwhile eliminate such little drawbacks and embarrassments as the existing relation between weight and strength in inorganic materials. No doubt the problem has attractions for those it interests, but to the ordinary man it would seem as if effort might be employed more profitably.The Wright brothers took flight on Dec. 17, 1903, 69 days later. According to a 2017 article from The Virginian-Pilot, that newspaper was the first and only one to report what had happened. The article said:News of the flight was leaked to reporters at The Virginian-Pilot hours after it happened. Pilot newsmen rushed to report the event and the original story published on Dec. 18, 1903, contained many errors.In 2003, on the anniversary of the flight, The Pilot ran a front page story, correcting many of the errors that appeared in the original story.According to the 2017 Virginian-Pilot article, some of the errors corrected in the 2003 front-page Virginian-Pilot article included information about who flew the plane. The original 1903 article said Wilbur Wright flew the plane, that he was the chief inventor of the machine, and that he had ""raven-hued hair and deep blue eyes."" In truth, Orville Wright flew the plane, and he didn't have ""raven-hued hair or deep blue eyes."" The brothers said they were equal inventors of the machine."	true
2699	Black Starbucks aprons have different meaning than the standard green ones.	"In late August 2021, the website Simplemost published a story with the headline, ""Starbucks’ Black Aprons Have A Different Meaning Than The Green Aprons.""""Customers may see Starbucks baristas donning an apron that is a different shade than the standard green because Starbucks has a specific color system for its uniform aprons,"" Simplemost reported. ""Each color signifies a special characteristic about the barista or store, a seasonal shift or a level of training that the barista has achieved.""Most Starbucks baristas wear a green apron. But according to an article posted to its blog ""Starbucks Stories and News,"" the company explained that employees who complete the Starbucks Coffee Master training program wear a black apron after passing written and taste tests:For more than a decade, Starbucks partners have been certified as Coffee Masters after completing coursework and an exploration of Starbucks coffees. They study Starbucks core coffees, such as French Roast and Pike Place® Roast, and rare Starbucks Reserve® coffees. The Coffee Master program acknowledges their knowledge and skill with the special designation of the black apron after they pass written and taste tests.The Starbucks blog further described other apron colors and their significance, including red, orange, and purple:In the early 1990s Starbucks introduced black aprons as special designation for partners certified in coffee knowledge, which later became what is now the Coffee Master program for partners. And in 1997, Starbucks first red holiday cups arrived, with each store (there were about 1,400 by then) receiving two red aprons for partners who were sampling Christmas Blend or stocking merchandise. Over the years, the apron has become a way to celebrate events and milestones and recognize partner contributions. Special embroidered aprons with an American flag celebrate veterans and military spouses and graduates of the Starbucks College Achievement Plan receive a green apron embroidered with a mortarboard. At a store in Malaysia dedicated to providing employment opportunities for Deaf partners, baristas wear aprons with the word “Starbucks” embroidered in sign language."	true
946	"In October 2021, Donald Trump Jr. was promoting and selling merchandise with the slogan, ""Guns don't kill people, Alec Baldwin kills people."""	"On Oct. 21, 2021, Halyna Hutchins, director of photography on the set of the movie ""Rust,"" was accidentally killed when actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun. In the wake of this tragedy, Donald Trump Jr. started to promote and sell shirts that read: ""Guns don't kill people, Alec Baldwin kills people.""This is a genuine product that was available for purchase on Don Jr.'s website, shopdonjr.com.The former U.S. president's son has also promoted these items on Instagram. In one Instagram story, Trump Jr. wrote, ""Get Yours Today [at] shopdonjr.com.""In another post, he shared a doctored image that supposedly showed Baldwin wearing one of these shirts:The death of Hutchins is currently under investigation. As of this writing, nobody has been arrested. While it's possible that Baldwin will be held responsible in some fashion for Hutchins' death (in addition to being an actor, he was also producing the film), a search warrant noted that Baldwin was told the gun didn't have live rounds when he was handed the prop weapon. NBC News reported:Alec Baldwin didn't know the prop gun he fired was loaded with live ammunition and neither did the assistant director who handed it to him before the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set Thursday, a search warrant document said.The assistant director yelled, ""Cold gun,"" before the shooting that killed Halyna Hutchins, 42, and wounded director Joel Souza, 48, on the set of ""Rust"" at Bonanza Creek Ranch, according to an affidavit filed in a Santa Fe court.The term ""cold gun"" is intended to indicate that the weapon did not have any live rounds, according to the document obtained by NBC affiliate KOB of Albuquerque and other news outlets."	true
2258	Emails about a class action settlement for National Grid in relation to TCPA are legitimate.	"In January 2022, Google users looked to find out if an email for a proposed class action settlement for National Grid was a ""scam or legit,"" as readers often do after receiving such notices. The email had the subject line, ""Notice of National Grid TCPA Settlement,"" and linked to the website, NationalGridTCPASettlement.com.This was a legitimate notice for a real class action settlement for National Grid. The case was named, ""Jenkins et al. v. National Grid USA Service Company Inc., et al."" The case number was listed as 15-cv-1219 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. ""TCPA"" stands for the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.National Grid is a utility company. According to the settlement website's FAQ page, ""the lawsuit claims that National Grid and its debt collectors made calls with automated dialers and/or prerecorded or artificial voice messages to cellular telephones,"" and that these telemarketing actions were done ""without the prior express consent of the persons called"":Plaintiffs allege that this conduct violates the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act. National Grid denies those allegations and disputes that it did anything wrong.Some of the calls at issue in the lawsuit were made directly by National Grid, while others were made by debt collectors hired by National Grid to collect utility debts that were allegedly past due. Many of the calls were made to persons who are or were National Grid utility account holders, but some calls were made to persons who were not a National Grid account holder.“National Grid” includes utilities operating in New York as KeySpan Gas East Corporation, The Brooklyn Union Gas Company, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation; in Massachusetts as Boston Gas Company, Colonial Gas Company (now part of Boston Gas), Massachusetts Electric Company, Nantucket Electric Company; and in Rhode Island as The Narragansett Electric Company.Plaintiffs Jarrett Jenkins, Emmot Steele, Frances Royal, Danai Ewan, and Charmaine Whyte filed the lawsuit against National Grid and some of its affiliated companies about these issues.The time period at issue in the settlement was from March 9, 2011, through Oct. 29, 2021. The case has been around since at least 2017.According to the National Grid TCPA settlement email notice and a December 2021 article from JD Supra, a $38.5 million settlement was reached.How much will eligible participants be able to pocket? According to the settlement website: ""It is estimated by Class Counsel that settlement payments will range between $50 and $150 per Settlement Class Member, although the actual amount could be higher or lower.""Claims must be submitted by May 12, 2022.On the National Grid TCPA settlement website’s FAQ page, it spelled out how readers can tell if they would be eligible for funds from the settlement.""You are part of the Settlement Class if you reside in the United States and received, a telephone call on a cellular telephone using a prerecorded or artificial voice message from March 9, 2011, until October 29, 2021, from the defendant concerning the items listed in FAQ 3 above,"" the website said:All persons residing in the United States who, from March 9, 2011 until October 29, 2021, received a telephone call on a cellular telephone using a prerecorded or artificial voice message concerning: (1) the payment or status of a current or past National Grid utility bill or account; (2) an “important matter” concerning a current or past National Grid utility bill or account; (3) a disconnect notice concerning a current or past National Grid utility account; (4) an invitation from National Grid to attend a Customer Assistance Expo or to meet with or speak to the National Grid Consumer Advocacy Group, National Grid Consumer Advocate, or National Grid Credit Department; or (5) the availability of a government assistance program, such as the Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP), to assist with payments to National Grid."	true
4786	Mixing cream of tartar with orange juice will flush nicotine from your body and help you quit smoking faster.	A viral story on Shareably first published in May 2018 claims that a mixture of orange juice and cream of tartar “will flush nicotine from your body and [help you] quit smoking faster.” Though Shareably's article is currently driving the bulk of viral traffic on this subject, the claim has a history on the internet going back at least a decade.Before diving into the science, several reasons exist to be suspicious of the article from a media literacy standpoint. Far from citing any peer-reviewed scientific paper, the article states that its primary source of information is an article from the company Providr, a clickbait mill Snopes exposed for fraudulent Facebook practices in multiple 2018 investigations. The article itself, which in reality devotes only a few sentences to the headline claim, cites questionable websites like Natural Health and Healing 4 You and Organic Facts to support its argument. Finally, that claim relies on one of the most overused tropes in pseudoscientific literature: the notion of “detoxifying your body” through nutrition:Low potassium is associated with just about every single health issue caused by smoking … This is why it is effective to use while quitting smoking. It puts potassium back into your system and gets your adrenal glands working in conjunction with the rest of your body. Then your body naturally decides which toxins to eliminate through bowel movements, urine, and sweat.Everyone knows the importance of keeping vitamin C. What many people don’t know is that nicotine blocks your ability to adequately absorb it into the blood. On the upside, one glass of OJ delivers well above the recommended daily value. So when you drink a glass mixed with Cream of Tartar, you twice [sic] the medical benefits.Potassium tartrate (and other potassium chemicals) exists as potassium ions in the body, which are undeniably crucial for several important cellular processes, and a factor in multiple health conditions. Despite its chemical importance, no scientific basis exists for any claim that it can affect the removal of nicotine from the body or ease the cessation of smoking. Instead, Shareably relies on vague, scientific sounding non sequiturs that do not actually provide support for the headline claim.Patrick Mulholland, a professor at The Medical University of South Carolina and an expert in the biological processes underlying addiction, described the claim as “ridiculous,” telling us via email that “there is currently no known mechanism by which increasing [potassium] in the diet will reduce smoking or relapse in individuals with nicotine dependence.”The most obvious implication made with these vague internet claims is that smoking somehow lowers levels of potassium in the body — a medical condition known as hypokalemia. “There is no evidence that smoking itself causes hypokalemia” Mulholland told us. In fact, he added, “acute nicotine exposure can increase [potassium] levels” in the bloodstream. In other words, smoking cigarettes, while undeniably bad for your health, does not create a potassium deficiency in the body that could be rectified by the addition of more potassium. (As another problem, “little is known” about how potassium levels in the body are affected by diet in the first place.)What about the claim that potassium helps “flush” nicotine out of the body by “get[ing] your adrenal glands working in conjunction with the rest of your body” such that “your body naturally decides which toxins to eliminate through bowel movements, urine, and sweat?” This is essentially gibberish. Cream of tartar has “a long history” as a purging agent for one simple reason: it has a diuretic effect, which means it increases the amount of water expelled from the body in urine.It is unclear, however, how that action would serve to increase the metabolism — i.e. breakdown — of nicotine. These chemicals are broken down into metabolites by the liver before being excreted as urine. Further, from an addiction standpoint, the rapid removal of nicotine from the body — even if potassium tartrate could cause that effect — would counterproductively serve to increase the frequency of cravings, not reduce them. The alleged role Shareably suggests vitamin C plays in this process is even less precise. A closer look at these arguments reveals them to be especially flimsy. The first proffered argument does not actually provide support for the assertion that potassium helps you remove nicotine and/or quit smoking, it merely suggests adding the orange juice to replace all the lost vitamins from the purging. To be clear, this would be a solution to a problem that didn’t exist before the treatment, not a path toward quitting smoking.Another explanation they provide is simpler, but decidedly less-impressive sounding: “drinking [orange juice and cream of tartar] will drastically alter the way things taste, including cigarettes,” implying that the unpleasant taste would make people less likely to smoke. This explanation may hold the closest relevance to their claims of smoking cessation, but it is one that is unsupported by any actual scientific research. The National Institute on Drug Abuse does not endorse that notion, and a review of the literature suggests that very few people, if any, have tested it.As a final note, consuming too much cream of tartar can lead to adverse health effects on its own — there have been rare cases of “life-threatening” hyperkalemia (too much potassium) resulting from people using cream of tartar as a cleanse. One of the driving features of pseudoscientific clickbait is that it floods a reader with bits and pieces of actual science that are then misrepresented or distorted. This article is no different.For example, the piece asserts that “low potassium is associated with just about every single health issue caused by smoking.” Correlation is not causation. The association presented here is used to falsely suggest that because people with low potassium and people who smoke share similar medical maladies, supplementation with potassium would be the solution. The problem with this argument is that one of the most common symptoms that chronic smokers experience is also the defining feature of hypokalemia: hypertension. Hypertension, in turn, is a major factor in most of the other complications — cardiac problems, etc. — at issue in smoking. That link does not mean smoking-connected hypertension is related to potassium levels in the bloodstream, nor has any research been published supporting that notion.Similarly, the article asserts that nicotine “blocks your ability to adequately absorb [vitamin C] into the blood.” While it is true that smokers generally have lower levels of vitamin C in their body, this association is used to support the notion that vitamin C has an important role to play in smoking-related maladies without ever explaining what role vitamin C deficiency is alleged to play in either preventing the removal of nicotine from the body or prolonging someone's efforts to quit smoking.	false
3931	The website everylegalvote.com provides empirical evidence that U.S. President Donald Trump would have won the 2020 general election were it not for voter fraud.	"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.In November 2020, the website everylegalvote.com was founded with the apparent goal of quantifying the impact of voter fraud on the U.S. presidential election. The centerpiece of this website is an electoral map that purports to show the results of the 2020 election as they stand now, how it looks when you factor in voter fraud, and how it looks when all voter fraud is removed. In the latter scenario, the website declares that U.S. President Donald Trump clearly won the election over his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.Many of the claims made on this site are not tethered to reality. The map is nonsense and is based on extrapolations from unverified claims, debunked rumors, and unproven data. If you visit everylegalvote.com (a site McAfee's Webadviser software marked as ""suspicious""), you can click the ""with voter fraud,"" ""current status,"" and ""without voter fraud"" tabs to change the results of the election. Pressing each button results in unusually precise changes to the data. In Arizona, for example, Biden's vote count changes from 1,648,642 ""with voter fraud"" to 1,591,641 ""without voter fraud."" How did this website determine that there were 57,001 fraudulent votes in Arizona? It isn't really explained.The website makes some general claims about how it uses ""proven statistical methods"" to find anomalies in the data, but it's short on detail. The website states:The fraud disaggregation process uses a large amount of voter patterns and proven statistical methods to find and document mathematical anomalies indicative of voter fraud or ballot tampering.As we collect and analyze more data we will be able to demonstrate with increasing granularity the difference between an election without tampering and one with more anomalies, which are indicative of tamperingFurthermore, this site states that it gets its data in part from ""fraud stories from every day Americans,"" but we found that many of the listed stories to be based on unfounded claims or debunked rumors. In Arizona, for example, the site lists five stories related to voter fraud. Two of those stories concern the debunked claim that ballots marked with Sharpies would be invalidated; one is just a tweet from Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar calling for a recount (Gosar's desire for a recount deals with debunked claims concerning Dominion Voting software), and another is a video that claims to show ""voter fraud caught on camera in Arizona"" but shows nothing of the sort. In fact, Arizona is barely mentioned in that video. As far as we can tell, Arizona is mentioned once regarding the debunked Sharpie claim and another time when the YouTube user suggests that ballots ""just appeared."" But ballots didn't just ""appear"" in Arizona. The vote count changed as votes were counted. The one story listed in this section that is at least tied to reality deals with an influx of split-ticket votes. While there did appear to be an uptick in split-ticket voting this year (voting a split-ticket is when you vote for one party's president but vote for the other party for the other selections on your ballot), this is completely legal and is not indicative of fraud.  Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, dismissed the notion of fraud in his state during an appearance on Fox News.Arizona Central reported:No conspiracy, just split-ticket voters“If indeed there was some great conspiracy, it apparently didn't work,” Brnovich told Fox Business’ Neil Cavuto on Wednesday. “The county election official, who's a Democrat, lost, and other Republicans won.”He was referring to Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes, who is trailing Republican Stephen Richer by more than 3,000 votes.Some Republicans point to the fact that Trump and GOP Sen. Martha McSally lost while GOP candidates did well in down-ballot races as evidence of a conspiracy. Someone, they reason, must have changed those votes at the top of the ticket.Brnovich shot that one down.“It came down to: People split their ticket,” he told Cavuto. “People voted for Republicans down ballot, and they didn't vote for President Trump or Martha McSally. So, that's the reality.""It's not clear how everylegalvote.com calculated that two hoaxes, a call for a recount, a misunderstanding of how election works, and an increase in split-ticket voting amounted to a 57,001 fraudulent vote swing for Biden. While the electoral map discussed above is the central feature of everylegalvote.com, this website also includes a ""voter fraud primer"" that briefly discusses the various ways voter fraud can supposedly be spotted. This section, however, is rife with false claims and misleading statements. We'll take a look at a few such claims below:Everylegalvote.com claims: Fraud is real. Fraud happens every day. In elections, fraud is a common issue.
Reality: Voter fraud is exceedingly rare. Study after study after study after study after study after study after study after study have concluded that voter fraud in the United States is rare. While testifying under oath before the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in September 2020, FBI Director Christopher Wray said: ""We have not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it’s by mail or otherwise.""In the days following the 2020 general election, election officials in every state reported that they had not seen evidence of voter fraud. Everylegalvote.com claims: It is NOT normal to stop counting the ballots in the middle of a count. The evidentiary chain is broken (what if someone sneaks a pile of fraud ballots in at 3:30 a.m.?). In every presidential election in the U.S. until 2020, counts were never stopped until they were completed.
Reality: Vote counts have been stopped or slowed before (most notably the recount in 2000), and claims that the vote ""stopped"" in 2020 are exaggerated. There have been multiple claims that vote counts were stopped during the 2020 election, but the majority of these claims have either proven false or have been clarified with simple explanations. Trump claimed, for example, that the vote in North Carolina had been ""called off."" But that's not the case. All of the available ballots in the state had been counted at that time and election officials were waiting for more legally cast mail-in ballots to arrive. In Philadelphia, there was some confusion after a reporter wrote that the state would not be reporting any more mail-in ballot numbers for the night, but city Commissioner Al Schmidt quickly clarified that, writing that ""Philadelphia will NOT stop counting ALL legitimate votes cast by eligible voters."" A viral Facebook post claimed that voting stopped in six states during the 2020 election, but that claim was false. It should also be noted that Trump's campaign has filed numerous lawsuits asking for the vote count to be stopped (something that everylegalvote.com argues is only done by those attempting to commit fraud) and that Trump himself has posted messages on Twitter such as ""STOP THE COUNT!""Everylegalvote.com claims: It is well established that [mail-in] voting is the easiest way to defraud a candidate. 
Reality: Mail-in voting is slightly more prone to fraud than in person voting, but the risk for fraud in both forms of voting is still extremely low. We covered claims about an increased risk of mail-in voter fraud here.Everylegalvote.com claims: The Democrat vs. Republican ratio in each batch of [mail-in] ballots should be very uniform across a region or a state.
Reality: In the months leading up to the election, it was widely reported that Democrats were returning more mail-in ballots than Republicans. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a surge in mail-in voting as many people wanted to avoid waiting in long lines surrounded by people. While Democrats urged their supporters to vote by mail, Trump continually pushed false claims about mail-in votes. It's not surprising, in other words, that one party saw more voters use mail-in ballots. Everylegalvote.com claims: We dig deep into this here, where we show that many states, including Virginia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Maine, and all show signs of ballot tampering and injections of Democrat ballots after the initial in-person votes have been counted.
Reality: This is not how elections work. Mail-in ballots are legal and are counted the same as in-person ballots.In most cases, mail-in votes are cast before election day. While states have different rules on when they can start counting votes, and while some states count in-person votes first, it simply is not accurate to say that that mail-in ballots were ""injected"" into the vote count. You can read an AFP Fact Check about this claim here. Everylegalvote.com claims: No Witnesses Allowed: Whenever one side tries to prevent the other side from watching ballots being opened or counted, it is a red flag. That side has something to hide. Fraud is the only thing that would be hidden from the opponent’s team in an election count. Democrat operatives prevented Republicans from observing the count in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, and Nevada.
Reality: Observers from both parties were allowed to watch the vote count. The claim that Republicans were prevented from observing the vote has been repeated in a variety of forms. A variety of news outlets and fact-checkers have investigated these claims and found them without merit. Judges, too, have dismissed lawsuits from the Trump campaign that made this allegation. PBS reported on one such lawsuit that had been filed in Philadelphia:A federal motion filed by lawyers for President Donald Trump’s campaign that sought to halt vote counting in Philadelphia has been dismissed as moot.The Thursday afternoon filing against the city’s election board sought an injunction to halt vote counting over allegations that observers from the Trump campaign had been unfairly barred from parts of the city’s ballot-counting area inside the Pennsylvania Convention Center.In an evening hearing, U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond said the campaign admitted that its observers had been allowed into the venue but that they had not been given equal access or numbers as Democrats.The federal judge seemed frustrated at times with arguments from the campaign.“I’m sorry, then what’s your problem?” said Diamond, a President George W. Bush appointee, after Trump lawyers conceded that observers had been admitted to the facility.Everylegalvote.com claims: Too many voters. When a political party is losing an election in the Third World, the party will pile on additional votes manufactured for its candidate. These always show up in the totals, which typically exceed the number of actual voters that exist in a precinct or county. There are numerous counties in the 2020 election with over 100% voters supposedly voting, and some states have astronomically high turnout percentages, such as Wisconsin.
Reality: Voter turnout was up in 2020, but no state saw ""over 100% voters.""This is another claim that has come in many forms. We previously investigated two rumors claiming that voter turnout had exceeded 100%. In both cases, the rumor compared old voter registration data with current voter turnout data. Here are links to these articles. Everylegalvote.com claims: The Dominion Voting machines are known to be connected to the Internet, allowing for bad actors to change vote tallies in the machines as they report counted ballots for each candidate. These machines have already been caught changing votes to Biden from Trump in Michigan and Georgia and Philadelphia. Here is a video showing 19,958 votes taken from Trump and given to Biden at 10:23pm on election night.
Reality: Dominion Voting software is not changing votes. Election officials have already addressed these ""glitches"" (which in most cases were actually human errors that were quickly corrected) and these problems did not impact the vote count. There have been multiple claims about fraud concerning Dominion Voting Software, but, again, these claims have all proven baseless. You can read our write-up of these rumors here, or check out The New York Times' investigation. For the purposes of this article, we'll point readers to a statement from Christopher Krebs, the director of the U.S. cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, who called these claims ""nonsense.""Everylegalvote.com claims: ""Dead"" people vote. To determine who has voted, the registered voter data has to be processed. Many citizen journalists and citizens have checked the state databases and found dead parents, siblings, and people born as far back as the early 1800s registered for absentee ballots and with voted ballots tallied in the swing states.
Reality: Dead people, generally speaking, don't vote.The claim that dead people are voting tends to pop up every election, but these claims are almost always based on a misreading of the data. A lawsuit filed by the Trump campaign, for example, claimed that a dead person had voted in Michigan. Election officials in the state, however, found that this was really a case of mistaken identify. The local news outlet Bridge Michigan reported:""Rather than a dead voter, though, it appears to be a case of mistaken identity caused by confusion over 'common names,' said Tracy Wimmer, a spokesperson for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's office.""News outlets, fact-checkers, and election officials have debunked similar claims. A viral list of dead people who supposedly voted in Michigan, for instance, was found to be full of holes. CNN reported:Of the 50, 37 were indeed dead and had not voted, according to the voter information database. Five people out of the 50 had voted -- and they are all still alive, according to public records accessed by CNN. The remaining eight are also alive but didn't vote.While it isn't common for a vote to be cast in a dead person's name, this has happened before. Most often, this involves a spouse casting a vote for a deceased partner. It is possible that 2020 will see a few examples of this occurring, but this not indicative of widespread voter fraud.  Everylegalvote.com claims: Witnesses this election have sworn they were ordered to back-date hundreds of ballots at the USPS, which is a crime.
Reality: A witness did swear that workers were ordered to back-date ballots. And then, under threat of perjury, he recanted his testimony.The Washington Post reported:Richard Hopkins’s claim that a postmaster in Erie, Pa., instructed postal workers to backdate ballots mailed after Election Day was cited by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) in a letter to the Justice Department calling for a federal investigation. Attorney General William P. Barr subsequently authorized federal prosecutors to open probes into credible allegations of voting irregularities and fraud before results are certified, a reversal of long-standing Justice Department policy.But on Monday, Hopkins, 32, told investigators from the U.S. Postal Service’s Office of Inspector General that the allegations were not true, and he signed an affidavit recanting his claims, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe an ongoing investigation. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee tweeted late Tuesday that the “whistleblower completely RECANTED.”Everylegalvote.com does not provide an accurate view of how voter fraud impacted the 2020 election. As of this writing, claims of voter fraud are largely unsubstantiated, making any claims that one candidate benefited from fraud while it served as a detriment to another to be, at best, premature."	false

A joint initiative by the City of Greater Melbourne and the Supreme Islamic Council of VictoriaThe reaction to it in some quarters was swift and furious, not to mention absurdly credulous:Yes, this is placed up by committed Muslims themselves not council (city of port Phillip). This has been seen @ Port Melbourne beach on the blvd @ the end of Todd rd. The sign is them effectively warning non Muslims to stay away but cleverly hidden under the word multiculturalism— Fred Flintstone (@fredfli30817030) January 30, 2018Simply another step closer to a European Islamic state, it is all structured and planned. This is getting near to Islamic saturation and when we are at a stage that the brotherhood feels in a position to go to the next step we will feel the full force of sharia. Education is key— Cris Martyn (@KaffirUk) January 28, 2018
Although there is an Islamic Council of Victoria representing the approximately 200,000 Muslims who in the state of Victoria, however, there is no organization called the ""Supreme Islamic Council of Victoria."" Moreover, the city of Melbourne doesn't typically refer to itself as ""the City of Greater Melbourne,"" nor are any municipal logos visible in the sign.Several inquiries directed to the city of Melbourne Twitter account about the image elicited an official disavowal:thanks for bringing this to our attention. This is not a City of Melbourne sign and we don't endorse it. As a side note we don't have any beaches in our municipality.— City of Melbourne (@cityofmelbourne) January 29, 2018
There are, in fact, several public beaches near Melbourne, but none in Melbourne. We take the city at their word that they did not post the sign. For that matter, there's no evidence that the sign was even posted in or near Melbourne, or anywhere else in Victoria. We've found no other images in which the sign is visible. Indeed, the photo could have been taken anywhere. We assume it was staged, either to ridicule Muslims or to instill a hatred and fear of Islam in those who are ignorant of what Muslims actually believe and how they live.The stunt relies on common misconceptions about and misrepresentations of Islam, such as that Muslims so abhor pigs and pork that they can't stand to be in their vicinity and would even demand that no one near them consume such products. That is simply not the case.Faithful Muslims observe dietary restrictions that are comparable in some ways to kosher laws in Judaism. Like Judaism, Islam prohibits the consumption of pork products as well as certain other foods, and sets a number of specific rules as to how food must be sources and prepared. These rules, called ""halal"" in Islam, also ban the consumption of alcohol. But they do not require that non-Muslims abide by these restrictions, much less that Muslims cannot share a beach with non-Muslims who do eat pork and drink alcohol.The same applies to the larger set of moral guidelines based on the Qur'an and the writings of Muhammad known as ""Sharia,"" which govern virtually every aspect of Muslim life. Perhaps the most common misconception about Islam of all is that Muslims wish to impose ""Sharia law"" on non-Muslims in secular countries. What Islam actually calls for, however, is for Muslims to follow Sharia and non-Muslims to follow the laws and moral principles of their own faiths."	false

These ad include ""job postings"" for such job classes as ""drug cartels,"" ""Jews"" and ""terrorism."" Clicking on these links takes prospective job seekers to a website advertising unrelated jobs. One user reported finding a similar posting for the Ku Klux Clan [sic] while he was looking up a news story:
In fact, searching the term ""nerdyhire"" via Google takes internet users to a page with various job postings, but the NerdyHire website itself is not hiring for ""$24-$45/Hr."":It appears NerdyHire ads dynamically incorporate search terms entered by users and appear to offer related ""$24-$45/Hr."" jobs as an advertising come-on.We reached out to NerdyHire to ask if they were aware that their ads were creating false impressions on the Internet but received no response."	false
855	The phrase “knocked up,” referring to pregnancy, originated with U.S. slavery.	"Slavery is mentioned in the Oxford English Dictionary entry for that usage of the phrase, but some online discussions of it appear to be based on a misunderstanding of what it says.Did the phrase ""knocked up"" come from slavery, as a viral tweet claimed? We were asked by several Snopes readers about it and found the claim to be false. A Dec. 10, 2022, Twitter post claimed, for example: ""The phrase 'knocked up,' referring to pregnancy, originated with U.S. slavery. The tweet continued: ""The Oxford English Dictionary traces the expression back to 1813.""The phrase ""knocked up,"" referring to pregnancy, originated with U.S. slavery. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the expression back to 1813.Back then the price of enslaved African women was ""knocked up"" by the auctioneer when she was pregnant—promoted as a deal for buyers.— johnathan (@JohnathanPerk) December 10, 2022The tweet further claimed the term came from the price of enslaved women being increased at slave auctions as a ""deal"" when they were pregnant, as the women's children would have inherited their enslaved status.The tweet had nearly 30,000 likes on Twitter when we last checked it. It was reposted on Instagram by Soledad O'Brien, who has over 500,000 followers on Instagram. Similiar claims have also been posted on platforms like TikTok. We reached out to the person who posted the original tweet and will update this check if we hear back.It is true that enslaved women were often impregnated by their owners. Nonprofit organization Encyclopedia Virginia wrote, ""Historians disagree about how systemic forced reproduction was, but it is clear from oral histories and other firsthand accounts that enslavers did engage in the practice."" According to the same source, historians question if any of these relationships could be consensual.The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) does indeed trace the earliest published instance of the phrase used in that sense back to 1813, but the specific reference given for that date doesn't mention slavery. Instead, the 1813 reference is from a diary written by Caleb Earle, a New Jersey company clerk. It said, ""April 12, 1813 — William Mick's widow arrived here in pursuit of J. Mick, who she says knocked her up.""The next reference given for the phrase in the OED entry does mention slavery. In the 1836 book ""Col. Crockett's Exploits and Adventures in Texas,"" frontiersman Davey Crockett quoted a fictional character as saying, ""N---er women are knocked down by the auctioneer, and knocked up by the purchaser.""  Crockett's use of ""knocked up"" demonstrates that the phrase was already being used about pregnancy before he used it about slavery over two decades later.The OED entry states the opposite of what the Twitter post said about the auctioneer. The tweet claimed the price of enslaved women who were pregnant was ""knocked up by the auctioneer"" in order to make a deal. The example in the OED entry says enslaved women, not their prices, were ""knocked down by the auctioneer"" (emphasis added).Other sources dedicated to the history of words, like the Online Etymology Dictionary, list the 1813 New Jersey reference as the earliest known source for the term. ""Knocked down"" has historically been a term used to refer to any item of property sold to the highest bidder in an auction. It's still used that way today. We reached out to several experts about the claim, as well as the etymologies of these two expressions, and will update this check with any additional information we learn."	false
5697	The Nike sports apparel company owns the Chevrolet automobile brand.	In September 2018, many social media users joined in calling for a boycott against Nike after the sports apparel company featured controversial former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in a new commercial. As images and videos purportedly showing these protesters burning Nike apparel started to circulate on the internet, a message suggesting that these individuals also get rid of their Chevrolet vehicles -- because Nike ostensibly owned that automobile manufacturer -- went viral on Facebook:This simply isn't true: Nike does not own Chevrolet.Nike is one of the largest apparel businesses in the world, and over the years they have acquired a number of related companies, such as Converse and Hurley. However, Nike does not own any car companies, let alone Chevrolet.  Chevrolet has been a division of the American automobile manufacturer General Motors for about a century now.	false
3724	Margaret Keenan, the first recipient of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020, was featured in a news report two months earlier, providing evidence of wrongdoing or deception.	"In December 2020, COVID-19 denialists, conspiracy theorists, and vaccine skeptics reacted in predictable fashion to news reports about the distribution of the first Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine doses in the United Kingdom on Dec. 8, 2020.Later that day, self-described conservative activist Mindy Robinson suggested misdeeds or deception were at work in the appearance of 90-year-old Margaret Keenan as the first person in the world to receive the vaccine since, according to Robinson, Keenan had appeared in a CNN report from two months earlier, suspiciously dressed in the exact same outfit.On Twitter, Robinson posted a screenshot from a Dec. 8 BBC News report that showed Keenan being attended to by a healthcare worker, along with the headline ""Covid-19 Vaccine: First Person Receives Pfizer Jab in UK"" alongside another screenshot taken from an Oct. 22 CNN article, which at first glance also appeared to be illustrated with a photograph of Keenan receiving a vaccination. Robinson wrote:Excuse me, but how is the exact same person who’s the “first to get vaccinated” today...also in a CNN photo wearing the exact same clothes, in the exact same chair, and getting a shot back in October? [Thinking face emoji] Which one of these lying stories did you want us to pretend is true?In reality, there was no deception, subterfuge, or conspiracy at work behind either the Dec. 8 BBC story, or the Oct. 22 CNN story. Keenan definitively did not appear in the earlier report, and Robinson hadn't ingeniously caught a shadowy cabal attempting to usher in a New World Order by secretly microchipping vaccine patients, or staging the vaccination campaign, or whatever specific wrongdoing or chicanery Robinson was alleging.In fact, the explanation was rather more mundane — either Robinson simply misunderstood a feature of CNN's website that causes new videos to be played on old webpages, or she knowingly misrepresented it. The screenshot of the BBC News report is authentic. The story can be read here. On Dec. 8, Margaret Keenan — originally from County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland but now living in Coventry, England — became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as part of an approved vaccination rollout. On the day, she wore a now-famous blue Christmas charity T-shirt and a gray cardigan, and she was given her vaccination by May Parsons, a matron at the University Hospital in Coventry, who is shown in photographs and videos alongside Keenan.The screenshot of the CNN story is more complicated. Some articles on the CNN website feature related embedded videos. Under those embedded videos, CNN places a ""reel"" of other video reports that are in some way related to the original one. So if a user navigates to the Oct. 22 CNN story in question — which carried the headline ""Faulty US Covid-19 response meant 130,000 to 210,000 avoidable deaths, report finds"" — the user should see the following video by default, and at the bottom of the screen, the ""reel"" of related videos:For readers accessing the October article after Dec. 8, one of those related videos had to do with Keenan and the other early recipients of the COVID-19 vaccine in the U.K. Readers can either deliberately choose one of the other videos from the reel, or simply do nothing — embedded videos on CNN have an ""autoplay next"" feature, meaning once a video ends, the site automatically starts up the next video in the reel. In this way, a reader could be on a web page that hosted an article from Oct. 22, while watching a video that was published much more recently, including the Dec. 8 video that featured Keenan receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. This is how that combination looked on CNN's desktop site:And for illustrative purposes, here's what it looks like when a different, unrelated video (this one about Rudy Giuliani) plays in the video embed frame on the Oct. 22 article:"	false
289	A hidden image of a topless woman appears in the home video version of Disney's 'The Rescuers.'	"On 8 January 1999, Disney announced a recall of the home video version of their 1977 animated feature The Rescuers because it contained an ""objectionable background image."" That image was one which appeared in a scene approximately 38 minutes into the film: as rodent heroes Bianca and Bernard fly through the city in a sardine box strapped to the back of Orville, proprietor of Albatross Air Charter Service, the photographic image of a topless woman can be seen at the window of a building in the background in two different non-consecutive frames, first in the bottom left corner, then at the top center portion of the frame:Unlike most rumors of risqué words and visuals hidden in Disney's animated films, this one was clearly true, and the images in question were undeniably purposefully inserted into the movie.The two ""topless woman"" frames had reputedly been present in the film ever since its original theatrical release in 1977 (a fact apparently confirmed by Disney, whose spokesperson said that the tampering ""was done more than 20 years ago""), although Disney claimed that they were not included in the 1992 home video release because that version ""was made from a different print.""Disney also maintained that the images were not placed in the film by any of their animators but were instead inserted during the post-production process. The company decided to recall 3.4 million copies of the video ""to keep our promise to families that we can trust and rely on the Disney brand to provide the finest in family entertainment.""Disney's announcement of the recall was considered a bit curious by some at the time it took place because, unlike previous rumors about ""hidden"" items in Disney's animated films, knowledge of the hidden images found in The Rescuers was not widespread until Disney itself made a public statement about it. As well, the frames in question were not noticeable during a normal viewing of the film — one had to know they were there and freeze-frame the video to view them."	true
1571	"After news reports said former U.S. President Barack Obama was planning to host ""hundreds"" of people for his 60th birthday party in early August 2021, he reduced the guest list to just family and close friends."	"Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and “advice” you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. 
As the delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 spread rapidly in summer 2021, Snopes readers asked us to investigate rumors swirling about former U.S. President Barack Obama's plans to host ""hundreds"" of celebrities and politicians at a party to celebrate his 60th birthday.According to posts readers had seen online, Obama was defying public health recommendations to curb the spread of the contagious coronavirus strain by scheduling the event at his estate on Martha's Vineyard, an island located south of Cape Cod in Massachusetts, the weekend of Aug. 7. The New York Times reported that George Clooney, Steven Spielberg, and Oprah Winfrey were among invitees.On Aug. 2, numerous news outlets and tabloids reported on the upcoming celebration on Martha's Vineyard, which is about 100 miles from Provincetown by road and ferry.An anonymous source, whose connection to the former president remained unknown, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the party's guest list spanned ""family, friends, and staff"" and a so-called ""COVID coordinator"" who would oversee efforts to make sure attendees tested negative for COVID-19 or were fully vaccinated. The celebration was planned to take place outdoors, per the reports.Following that news coverage, FOX News' Peter Doocy asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki if Obama was setting the ""wrong example"" considering the delta variant's spread, C-SPAN footage and an official White House transcript show.Psaki — who served in Obama's presidential administration — referred Doocy to Obama's team organizing the party for its specifics, adding:Psaki: Former President Obama has been a huge advocate of individuals getting vaccinated. When CDC provided guid- — has provided — what CDC has provided guidance on is for indoor settings in high or substantial high zones of COVID cases. This event, according to all the public reporting, is outdoors and in a moderate zone. But in addition, there is testing requirements and other steps they are taking, which I’m sure they can outline for you in more detail.In other words, Psaki emphasized that public health officials considered Martha's Vineyard a ""moderate zone"" for COVID-19 cases — which, by the CDC's definition, means there's ""sustained transmission with high likelihood or confirmed exposure within communal settings and potential for rapid increase in cases."" (The press secretary's office confirmed with Snopes that was indeed the measurement to which she was referring. Since the Aug. 2 briefing, however, the CDC's rating for Dukes County, which covers Martha's Vineyard, worsened to ""high"" rates of transmission."")The exchange with the Fox News reporter and Psaki continued like this, according to the C-SPAN video and transcript:Doocy: But is there any concern, just because — as you said here, and you’ve had people saying over the last couple days — vaccinated people can still spread this Delta variant around? So is there concern that this President Obama birthday party might become a super-spreader event?Psaki: Well, I think, Peter, the guidance is about what steps people can take when they’re in public settings — indoor settings, specifically, was the new guidance — to keep themselves and others safe.In terms of what protocols they are taking, I would refer you to them, and I’m sure they can give you more details.Doocy: So, people who are watching this at home and they see, 'Well, if President Obama can have a party with several hundred people,' should they think that it is okay for them to have a party with several hundred people now?Psaki: Well, we certainly advise everyone to follow public health guidelines, which I know the former President, who is a huge advocate of getting vaccinated, of following the guidance of public health experts, would certainly advocate for himself as well.As of this writing, the CDC recommends everyone, regardless of their vaccination status, to wear masks indoors in public in areas of ""substantial or high transmission."" You can check the status of your home or destination using this interactive tool, and you can review all of the CDC's recommendations for vaccinated individuals here.Let us note here: The day before the above-transcribed comments by Psaki, Director of the National Institutes of Health Francis Collins told CNN's Jake Tapper that ""there will be some need for common sense"" when it comes to hosting large, in-person events at this stage in the pandemic. Collins said, according to a transcript by that news outlet:If you're talking about a small party like I might have at my house for six or eight people who are all fully vaccinated, I do not believe, at this point, we need to put masks on to be next to each other.But if there were 100 people — and, of course, how are you really going to be sure about people's vaccination status? And maybe there's some immunocompromised people there who, though they're vaccinated, are not actually fully protected, then the dynamic changes a little bit. There will be some need for common sense there.However, it was true that, after reports about Obama's party surfaced — including a news story by CBS Boston in which Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, told reporters he would not go to the celebration if he had gotten an invite — Obama's team reversed course.Hannah Hankins, a spokeswoman for the former president, said in a statement to news outlets including Snopes, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and CNN on Aug. 4:“The outdoor event was planned months ago in accordance with all public guidelines and covid safeguards in place. Due to the new spread of the Delta variant over the past week, the President and Mrs. Obama have decided to significantly scale back the event to include only family and close friends.”David Axelrod, a former top Obama adviser, elaborated on the change in comments to The New York Times:“They’ve been concerned about the virus from the beginning, asking invited guests if they had been vaccinated, requesting that they get a test proximate to the event,” Axelrod said. “But when this was planned, the situation was quite different. So they responded to the changing circumstances.”Snopes also asked Hankins for the updated guest list of ""only family and close friends"" and she said they have not confirmed the names. Snopes also reached out to representative for Axelrod for any more details on what, exactly, motivated the change, and we have not received a response."	true
835	A photo shows the view from an airplane flying above the clouds of smoke coming from the Feb. 3, 2023, Ohio train derailment.	"On Feb. 14, 2023, a Reddit user posted a picture with the caption, ""Passenger photo while plane flew near East Palestine, Ohio ... chemical fire after train derailed."" The context of the photo, purportedly, was that it had been taken from an airplane flying at cruising altitude, where black smoke from the Ohio train derailment was visible in the layer of clouds down below.The post accumulated more than 142,000 points and rocketed to the front page of the website, making it one of the most popular posts of the day.We approached the picture with some caution, as social media users have been known to make fake or unrelated photos go viral following disasters. For example, we recently reported about how several years-old pictures were shared with the misleading claim that they were taken after the earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria in February 2023.We initially rated this fact-check claim as ""Unproven,"" adding that it was entirely possible that it was real, but more data would be needed in order to confirm its authenticity.On the day after we published this story, we were provided with enough new evidence to change our rating from ""Unproven"" to ""True.""In this story, we've documented our journey to discovering the origins of this and other similar, seemingly ominous photos.There's no question that the train derailment that occurred on Feb. 3, 2023, led to massive amounts of smoke filling the air around East Palestine, Ohio, not to mention various concerns over the environmental impact of the disaster. Such concerns were discussed in another Reddit post that showed a different aerial picture, one that we were able to authenticate as real.In the days following the disaster, journalists and professional photographers shared multiple pictures taken from the ground that showed a massive smoke cloud coming from the site of the derailment. This smoke was the result of a controlled burn that was occurring. The controlled release of toxic fumes was seen to be safer than the possibility a large explosion, according to officials.On Feb. 6, The Associated Press reported that Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine had ordered temporary evacuations to allow the controlled release of toxic fumes to occur.Officials warned the controlled burn would send phosgene and hydrogen chloride into the air. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas that can cause vomiting and breathing trouble and was used as a weapon in World War I.Scott Deutsch of Norfolk Southern Railway earlier said doing this during the daytime would allow the fumes to disperse more quickly and prevent the rail cars from exploding and sending shrapnel and other debris from flying through the neighborhood.""We can't control where that goes,"" he said.The process involves using a small charge to blow a hole in the cars, allowing the material to go into a trench and burning it off before it's released in the air, he said. The crews handling the controlled release have done this safely before, Deutsch said.Officials lifted the evacuation order two days later on Feb. 8.As for the Reddit post with the photo taken from an airplane, we initially found some reason to dig deeper to find out if it authentically showed what it said it showed.The user who made the Reddit post later said in a comment, ""I didn't take this photo - I found it on Twitter."" They then linked to the tweet from Feb. 14. However, that tweet has since been been deleted.According to an archive of the tweet from Google cache, the Twitter user who posted it originally shared the following caption: ""This is a picture from a airplane flying above the East Palestine area on the day the chemicals were released from the train car.""A different tweet from Feb. 13 showed the same photo, along with another one. The user claimed, ""This is more than #Ohio. I'm across the lake (Lake Erie) in southern Ontario Canada by Niagara Falls and me and my family have had non stop head aches for about 7 days straight now. We can literally smell the chlorine over here in Canada. This is bigger than they are telling us.""According to replies, this user hadn't responded to requests for information regarding where they claimed to have obtained the pictures.Another Twitter user named @BillyM2k also reposted one of the photos, but later tweeted, ""Note that the source is 'from Reddit' and his source was 'from Twitter,' so it's quite possible that this pic is a bunch of crap.""Additionally, a third photo was going around that also supposedly showed the same dark clouds from far away. Newsweek later reported that its team had established contact with Jared McLuhan, the person who captured this wider picture.One of the replies under the tweets from @BillyM2k came from the popular Zoom Earth account. The Twitter bio for @zoom_earth says that its website, zoom.earth, allows users to ""track storms in real-time.""The account noted of the skies above East Palestine on Feb. 6, ""A black area can be seen here but not very clearly due to the day-night imagery overlap."" This was a helpful piece of information, but wasn't quite enough data for us to be able to say whether or not the photos and their captions were authentic.The same user also later sent a ""clearer view"" of the same area.This authentic satellite data indicated that there had been an isolated area of darkness above the site of the train derailment.On the day after this story was originally published, a reader named Colin Sullender contacted us about a post they had made on Octodon.Social. The information pointed to Twitter user @dj23white, an account with an airplane emoji after their display name, ""Charlie 3 Sticks."" Sullender told us they believe this user may be a commercial airline pilot.On Feb. 6, the @dj23white user tweeted the photo that would later appear on Reddit. This was the same day that the controlled burn began. The tweet's caption read, ""From the sky."" In other words, this was the best evidence yet that the picture may very well have been authentic.That tweet from @dj23white was later deleted, but was archived by Google cache. That Google cache information was then saved to archive.today by Sullender. We reached out to @dj23white but did not immediately receive a response.Sullender posted that they believed this source ""appears to match the timeline of events,"" but that unless the user can provide information to confirm the origins of the photo, ""it's impossible to determine its legitimacy.""Hours later, Sullender uncovered a Reddit post from Feb. 7 that only received a little over 500 points. This post said that it showed a fourth photo of the skies above the Ohio train derailment.In our research, we found multiple tweets with users who were skeptical that these pictures truly did show the smoke from the Ohio train derailment.Again, we first rated our story as ""Unproven,"" as there initially appeared to be a lack of enough evidence to confirm the claim. However, within the 24 hours after we published our article, several new pieces of data came to light.There are four photos of the dark clouds, at least three that were shot from different angles. None of them showed up in reverse image searches as being older than the train derailment. Newsweek interviewed a person who said they took one of the wide shots out of an airplane window. We also had the satellite images from Zoom Earth that showed a dark spot in the clouds above East Palestine on Feb. 6. Additionally, we ran the photo in question through the technology on FotoForensics.com and found no signs that it had been doctored."	true
655	The Nashville Covenant School shooting on March 27, 2023, was a “false flag.”	"On March 27, 2023, claims began to spread on social media that the Nashville Covenant School shooting was a ""false flag."" Those claims are false. ""False flag"" conspiracy theories portray tragedies as orchestrated events aimed at advancing a political agenda. These false claims often spread in the aftermath of mass shootings, including the Sandy Hook and Uvalde school shootings. Typically, they characterize the victims of such crimes as hired ""crisis actors"" or unwitting pawns in an insidious plot to deceive the public.The Nashville Covenant School shooting, which left three students and three adults at the school dead, was no different. There have been several posts on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit asserting that the shooting was a false flag.One variant claims that the shooting clearly must have been a false flag because a woman who had previously survived the Highland Park mass shooting in July 2022 ""interrupted"" a news conference during an update about the situation. ""Tell me you're pulling out all the stops with your false flag narrative without telling me you're pulling out all the stops,"" a Twitter user posted.Tell me you're pulling out all the stops with your false flag narrative without telling me you're pulling out all the stops. pic.twitter.com/RA0hVMNQUS— AwakenedOutlaw⚒️ (@AwakenedOutlaw) March 27, 2023Another tweet accused the woman of being a ""crisis actor"" — someone who pretends to be a victim of a tragedy in order to manipulate public opinion about the event.There's no evidence the woman, Ashbey Beasley, is a crisis actor. She said she was on a family vacation and meeting a friend whose son's school then went into lockdown. After a news conference with Metropolitan Nashville Police, news publications like USA Today and The Washington Post reported that she turned to reporters and asked, ""Aren't you guys tired of covering this?"" The moment was caught on video and aired by news organizations like Fox News, from which the video that has circulated most frequently online originated.We reached out to Beasley about the ""crisis actor"" accusation, and will update this fact check if we hear back.Another post asserted that U.S. President Joe Biden was in on the alleged false flag. ""Biden already knows what kind of gun it was & how she had,"" a Twitter user posted. ""It just happened he knows everything already. False flag palooza."" Attached to the tweet was a photograph that says Biden said (erroneously) that the shooter used two AK-47s, but that police hadn't released the make and model of the guns that were used at that point.Biden already knows what kind of gun it was & how she had.It just happened he knows everything already.False flag palooza https://t.co/HuXndUuDLD pic.twitter.com/twu2XOt6Yb— GM_Anon (@AnonWeaponry3) March 27, 2023When addressing the shooting on March 27, Biden said, ""You know, the shooter in this situation reportedly had two assault weapons and a pistol — two AK-47."" Biden didn't claim he knew how the shooter had obtained the guns. The Metropolitan Nashville Police on March 27 released photographs of the guns the shooter used. At the time of this publication, the guns were identified in news reports as an AR-15, a Kel-Tec SUB 2000, and a handgun. There is no evidence that Biden knew about the shooting beforehand. At the time of the shooting, he was in Washington, D.C., speaking at the Small Business Administration Women's Business Summit. It should not surprise anyone that the president would receive some details about such an incident before they have been widely disseminated. "	false
786	A picture authentically shows a young Jeff Bezos in Amazon company offices during its early days in 1999.	"Nearly three decades ago, Amazon was founded as a website that aimed to sell books quickly and efficiently. Since then it expanded into a tech conglomerate worth billions of dollars, making it one of the world's largest online retailers. We spotted a picture claiming to represent the company and its founder, Jeff Bezos, in relatively more humble origins. The picture claims to show Bezos' offices in 1999, and depicts him seated before an older model computer, with ""amazon.com"" painted on a sign on the wall next to him. This is indeed an accurate picture of Amazon offices in its early days. We searched for pictures or videos of his office and found this 1999 report titled ""Nerd of the Amazon"" from CBS News' ""60 Minutes,"" in which correspondent Bob Simon interviewed the tech mogul. While the report itself does not feature the exact shot above, we know that Simon is seated next to Bezos and the office in which he conducts part of the interview is the same with the ""amazon.com"" sign. Bezos' office can be seen at the 1:37 mark: Earlier in the interview Simon says of Bezos' desk, which happens to be an old door, ""Come on! You can afford a better desk than that.""In response, Bezos says, ""It's a symbol of spending money on the things that matter to customers, and not spending money on the things that don't."" ""And you don't need clean carpets,"" Simon retorts. At that point in 1999, Simon described Bezos as ""a giant"" and a ""titan of our time."" Bezos was a billionaire who still worked out of dingy Seattle offices. Amazon was a relatively new phenomenon, but Simon was incredulous about the state of the office.""More like a college dorm than a corporate headquarters,"" Simon said. His introduction to Bezos also poked fun at the billionaire's unusual laugh: ""You generally hear him before you see him [...] It's the ear-piercing laugh of billionaire Jeff Bezos.""The same office, but with a different individual seated alongside Bezos, was featured in a ""60 Minutes Australia"" interview that aired in 2000, as per the program's official YouTube account. The moment featuring Bezos' office can be seen at the 6:29 mark: Liz Hayes, the correspondent, pointed out, ""Like everyone else in his office, Bezos uses an old door as a desk."" The office shown in this interview has the same sign on the wall, and the same desk and computer as the photograph above, but the person sitting next to Bezos is different.  "	true
3233	On April 1, 2021, billionaire rapper Kanye West was reported to have bought the music streaming platform Spotify.	On April 1, 2021, a rumor circulated online that billionaire rapper Kanye West bought Spotify, a popular music streaming platform with 155 million subscribers globally.The claim appeared to have originated with an article published by Thissongissick (TSIS), an online blog dedicated to music news.“It’s official: As of today, the fashion and music mogul has just acquired the ever-popular audio streaming platform, Spotify,” wrote the website. “Something big like this isn’t unpredictable for West, but people are curious about his intentions for buying out Spotify.” Screengrab/ThissongissickThe article also claimed that the billionaire rapper was going to delete all songs but his own — a claim that sparked concern among some of the platform’s 345 million active monthly users.Snopes contacted TSIS and Spotify for comment, but did not receive a response in time for publication. Even so, we should note that the article was published on April Fools' Day, and news of the buyout did not appear in any other reputable news publications. And a look through the Spotify news releases through April 2 did not reveal an announcement that marked the alleged buyout.As such, we rate this claim “False.”According to a statement released by Spotify on March 18, founder Daniel Ek was still the platform’s CEO and had been overseeing the audio-streaming subscription service since it was launched in 2006.Spotify is headquartered and legally domiciled in Sweden, and because it is a foreign company, it is not required to disclose the same information as U.S. firms concerning share ownership, reported the financial website Investopedia on Jan. 7. The site noted that the top institutional shareholders of Spotify include Ek, as well as Sven Hans Martin Lorentzon, Baillie Gifford & Co., Morgan Stanley, Tencent Holdings Ltd., and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Still, no sign of West.And though the Grammy-award-winning musician is indeed a billionaire (though not the richest Black man in American history), his personal fortune caps in around $1.8 billion.

"In late May 2020, readers asked Snopes to verify whether U.S. President Donald Trump's Facebook page had shared a video showing the logo of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's 2020 campaign superimposed on a coffin, implying that either Biden was (figuratively) inside the coffin or his campaign was dead.No caption was included with the video, leaving interpretation up to the viewer.The queries from readers came the same week Trump and the official White House Twitter account were flagged by Twitter for posting tweets that violated the platform's rules against ""glorifying violence.""It's true that on May 26, the Donald J. Trump Facebook page did post such a video. The video features a troupe of Ghanian pallbearers who have gone viral for performing exuberant dance routines while carrying coffins at funerals.The video posted to Trump's Facebook page shows Biden stating, ""If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black."" It then shows the dancing pallbearers video with Biden's campaign logo superimposed on the coffin.Biden stirred controversy for making that remark during an interview with Charlamagne tha God on ""The Breakfast Club"" radio show. He later apologized."	true

"In January 2019, a screenshot of a tweet purportedly posted by Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Muslim, about how ""Americans"" had been ""raping and pillaging"" her people for decades began to spread on social media networks:This was not a genuine tweet from Rashida Tlaib.Although some posters presented this screenshot as if it showed a message that Tlaib had tweeted and then quickly deleted, this tweet was never posted to the congresswoman's Twitter account.A common tactic of Internet trolls is to impersonate celebrities and politicians by creating social media handles that resemble the legitimate handles of their targets.

Frequent internet users have likely come across at least one story about the generosity of actor Keanu Reeves.Perhaps it was the video of the Speed star giving up his seat on the subway, or maybe it was a report about his involvement with charitable causes such as PETA, or his donations to fund children's hospital and cancer research. Or maybe it was the story of how Keanu bought motorcycles for the stuntmen after filming The Matrix. Or, most likely, it was the (exaggerated) tale of how the actor gave away a portion of his Matrix salary to the crew.Stories of Reeves' generosity became so prevalent that by February 2018 they had morphed into a bit of an internet joke. Internet users started sharing outlandish and imaginary tales about how he had come to their unlikely rescue.The following meme, for instance, claimed that Reeves randomly gave an envelope full of cash to a stranger after learning that the man's son needed a kidney transplant:	false
4561	Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer banned the sale or purchase of American flags during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. 
On April 9, 2020, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-42 as part of the state's effort to combat the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. This order extended the state's shelter-in-place policy to May 1 and tightened some business regulations. For instance, one section of the order required stores larger than 50,000 square feet to do the following:Close areas of the store — by cordoning them off, placing signs in aisles, posting prominent signs, removing goods from shelves, or other appropriate means — that are dedicated to the following classes of goods:A. Carpet or flooring.
B. Furniture.
C. Garden centers and plant nurseries.
D. Paint.But Executive Order 2020-42 did not mention the purchase of American flags. Read the order in its entirety here or review a FAQ about it here. When we reached out to Whitmer's office, we were told: ""No, Governor Whitmer is not banning buying US flags.""As Michiganders were adjusting to this new set of rules, Twitter user Pure Michigan Girl posted a photograph supposedly showing American flags behind a strand of caution tape and claimed that there was ""no buying flags in"" Michigan:This single tweet was the sole piece of evidence provided by the hyperpartisan and conspiratorial website The Gateway Pundit in their article headlined ""And There It Is… Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer Bans Buying US Flags During Lockdown.""The claim made in that headline is false. Whitmer did not ban the purchase of American flags during lockdown. We have not been able to pinpoint the origins of the above-displayed image but it seems reasonable to assume that this photograph was truly taken at a Costco in Michigan shortly after this executive order was signed. As flowers and plants can be seen in this photograph, it's likely that it shows Costco's gardening department after it was cordoned off due to Whitmer's new restrictions. While the photograph may be genuine, it does not mean that Michigan has banned the purchase of American flags. Executive Order 2020-42 may make it difficult (or even impossible) to purchase an American flag from a non-essential department at a big box store, but it does not prohibit the purchase of American flags in the state. There's nothing in this order, for instance, banning the sale of an American flag at a store under 50,000 square feet or online. In fact, Executive Order 2020-42 makes no mention of American flags at all. As of this writing, American flags can still be purchased on the websites of some Michigan lawmakers.Shortly after this article was published, two things happened: First, the FAQ section on Executive Order 2020-42 was updated to include a question about American flags:Q: Does Executive Order 2020-42 prohibit buying an American flag?A: No. While the order places certain limits on how goods are sold, it does not ban Michiganders from buying any item, including flags.Second, The Gateway Pundit changed the headline of their article to omit its false claim. The website changed its original headline, ""And There It Is… Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer Bans Buying US Flags During Lockdown,"" to ""And There It Is… Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s Lack of Clarity Causes Confusion For Consumers During Lockdown."""	false
1098	Ivory Soap's unique floatability came about as the result of a manufacturing error.	"Origins:   In 1878, managers at Procter & Gamble's soap and candle factory in Cincinnati, Ohio, were puzzled by consumer requests for more of ""the soap that floats."" The company had recently introduced a new product called White Soap, an offering meant to compete with the fine soaps from Spain that were then taking a fair bite out of the American market. Could White Soap be the mysterious ""soap that floats"" consumers kept inquiring about?The story that Procter & Gamble had always offered was that the ""floating soap"" was the result of an accident: Perhaps Ivory's most famous feature — its ability to float — was the result of an accident! An employee failed to shut off the soap-making machine when he went to lunch. When he returned, he found the soap mixture puffed-up and frothy. After consulting with his supervisor, the decision was made to finish and ship the soap since the ingredients had not been changed in any way by the longer mixing time.About a month later, P&G received orders for more of ""the floating soap."" The people in the Order Department were perplexed. Only after some detective work was the mystery solved. The long forgotten lunch-time accident had produced a floating soap!Perhaps Ivory's most famous feature — its ability to float — was the result of an accident! An employee failed to shut off the soap-making machine when he went to lunch. When he returned, he found the soap mixture puffed-up and frothy. After consulting with his supervisor, the decision was made to finish and ship the soap since the ingredients had not been changed in any way by the longer mixing time.About a month later, P&G received orders for more of ""the floating soap."" The people in the Order Department were perplexed. Only after some detective work was the mystery solved. The long forgotten lunch-time accident had produced a floating soap! Because of this employee's supposed error, far more than the usual amount of air was incorporated into that one particular batch. Rather than confess to his screw-up, he sent the overwhipped product down the line. The batch hardened, was chopped into bars, and was sent on to market with no one other than the one errant worker (and possibly his manager) knowing anything was out of place about it.In 2004, however, a Procter & Gamble company archivist found information documenting that the ""floating soap"" came about through deliberation, not accident: Company archivist Ed Rider said he has discovered that a P&G chemist, James N. Gamble, had previously studied with another chemist who already knew how to make soap float. Gamble was son of company co-founder James Gamble.Rider said he has discovered a notebook entry from 1863 in which Gamble wrote: ""I made floating soap today. I think we'll make all of our stock that way.""The company's early leadership realized that the floating capacity could have marketing appeal, Rider said. Whatever its origins, consumers loved this exciting new product because they were no longer fishing about in murky water for elusive soap. The new White Soap refused to get lost, as it would pop up to the surface no matter how many times it was dropped into a bucket or sink. Procter & Gamble was quick to see the advantages of marketing such a product. Orders were given to henceforth produce all batches of White Soap as ""floating soap"" to meet consumer demand, and in October 1879 the first bar of Ivory Soap was produced: Today, Ivory floats because we intentionally whip a small amount of air into Ivory as it's being made. This makes the soap lighter than water, so it floats. This process also makes each bar of Ivory velvety smooth and easy to lather.The famous ""99.44/100% Pure"" slogan came about as the result of laboratory analysis:This famous slogan originated in the 1800's when samples of Ivory were sent to college chemistry professors and independent laboratories for analysis. Comparison tests were made with castile soaps — the standard of excellence at that time. One chemist's analysis was in table form with the ingredients listed by percentage. Harley Procter totaled the ingredients which did not fall into the category of pure soap — they equaled 56/100%. He subtracted from 100, and wrote the slogan ""99-44/100% Pure®: It Floats."" This became a pledge of quality to Ivory consumers. This phrase is so identified with Ivory, it's registered as a trademark with the United States Trademark office."	false
1020	The word “spaz” originates from “spastic diplegia,” a form of cerebral palsy that results in muscle stiffness mainly in the legs.	"While the term has been used as an ableist slur in numerous situations, and is considered derogatory in the United Kingdom among other places, it does not have the same connotations in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). The origins of the term, however, are undisputed. In the summer of 2022, controversy ensued over the lyrics of popular songs by Beyonce and Lizzo, both of which used a term that is considered ableist. In Beyonce's song ""Heated,"" the singer used the words ""spaz"" and ""spazzin"" as a callback to freestyle ballroom events. Lizzo used the term in her song ""Grrrls."" Both singers appeared to use it to describe being out of control, language that disability advocates criticized. The singers reacted swiftly, removing the lyrics after the outcry. According to Merriam-Webster, the term ""spaz"" is slang for ""one who is inept,"" and it comes from a shortening of the word ""spastic."" The Cambridge Dictionary describes it as ""an extremely offensive word for a person who has cerebral palsy [...] a condition of the body that makes it difficult to control the muscles."" According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word originated from the Latin spasticus and from the Greek spastikos, which mean ""afflicted with spasms,"" and was used to describe ""a person affected with spastic paralysis"" around 1896 and ""used insultingly by 1960s.""""Spastic"" is also considered an offensive term in the U.K., according to the Oxford Learner's Dictionary, which describes it as ""a word for a person who is affected by cerebral palsy that is now considered offensive,"" and as ""an offensive word used by children to mean 'a stupid person'."" According to Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage, as cited in Oxford Reference, the term was ""used since the 18th century to describe medical conditions characterized by spasmodic movements of the limbs."" The explanation describes how the term evolved over time:[...] ignorantly and offensively used by some people in the 1970s and 1980s as a term of abuse directed at anyone judged to be uncoordinated or incompetent. Also as noun. The abusive use has compromised the normal use of the word to an extent that makes it considered too offensive now. Phrases such as 'having cerebral palsy' for the adjective and 'person with cerebral palsy' for the noun are now standard [...]""Spastic"" has historically been used to describe people with spastic paralysis or cerebral palsy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), spastic diplegia is a form of cerebral palsy where ""muscle stiffness is mainly in the legs, with the arms less affected or not affected at all. People with spastic diplegia might have difficulty walking because tight hip and leg muscles cause their legs to pull together, turn inward, and cross at the knees (also known as scissoring).""There are other more severe forms of spastic cerebral palsy as well, including spastic quadriplegia/quadriparesis, which affects all four limbs, the trunk, and face. People with this condition ""usually cannot walk and often have other developmental disabilities such as intellectual disability; seizures; or problems with vision, hearing, or speech,"" according to the CDC. This is not the first controversy regarding the term, which highlights how the phrase is considered differently by different communities. Back in 2006, golfer Tiger Woods caused ripples across the pond for using the term, resulting in critical headlines in the United Kingdom, where the word is more widely considered to be a derogatory slur. After the Lizzo and Beyonce controversy, Clementine Williams, a Black and disabled writer pointed out that the term means something different in African American Vernacular English (AAVE), and its usage is more than just a slur: Disabled advocates, mainly from the UK, expressed anger with Lizzo after using the word spaz in her lyrics, because it is known as a derogatory term against individuals with cerebral palsy. Spaz, short for ""spastic,"" references the inability for a disabled person to control their movements. As an African American, the information felt brand new. Personally, I had grown familiar with Black artists using the terminology in music, especially during the '90s era of hip-hop. Spaz was not used to make fun of the disabled community, but as a descriptor for ""going wild,"" usually for when one is partying and losing themselves to the atmosphere. I also have heard ""spaz"" in the context of someone on the brink of irritation or annoyance. I saw ""spaz"" as what it had always been to me — African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Now, I am not using the history of spaz in AAVE to dismiss the harm that the slur has caused to the disabled community. As a Black disabled person, I wish to open dialogue concerning the policing of AAVE alongside the erasure of Black disabled voices in this discussion. The majority of public call-outs were tweeted by white disability advocates in the UK. Black disabled people have expressed feeling overlooked in the entire debate. One such activist, Vilissa Thompson, told NPR that she wished more Black disabled voices were amplified in the discussion, as they understood the nuances in the way the word was used by people and the way others are reclaiming the term.Thompson also discussed how language has evolved: ""The onus is on us to not just unlearn but also update and improve the way that we communicate with each other, so that our words are intentionally used, so that they don't cause unintentional harm."" "	true

5093	U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib is under investigation for election fraud.	In July 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted about a group of Democratic congresswomen as foreign-born troublemakers who should go back to the “broken and crime infested places from which they came.” Immediately afterwards, the internet saw a surge of negative articles and memes about the women whom Trump was presumably referencing: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. (Only Omar, from Somalia, was actually born outside the U.S.)On July 19, the Potatriots Unite junk news website played into this trend by publishing an article positing that Tlaib was under investigation for election fraud:Inside sources have revealed that Michigan Democrat Representative Rashida Tlaib is under FBI investigation for alleged election tampering in her own election.It is alleged that Tlaib, in her zeal to win and attempt to take down the president, rigged voting machines in her district to allow her name to appear as a voting option. This after her republican rival, whose company manufactured the machines, had erased any mention of her on the ballots.Not only was that premise absurd on its face (i.e., one candidate trying to outfraud the other) and Tlaib not under investigation for election fraud, but the Potatriots Unite narrative ran contrary to the basic facts of the election it referenced. Tlaib won her seat in the U.S. House in a 2018 election in which she garnered a whopping 84% of the vote — in large part because the previous incumbent had resigned the seat after facing allegations of sexual misconduct, and no Republican filed to run in the general election.	false
238	Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy said in June 2023 that the country would hold no elections until its war with Russia ends.	"The Ukrainian constitution prohibits holding elections during periods of martial law.On June 22, 2023, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the BBC that Ukraine's scheduled 2023 parliamentary and 2024 presidential elections would occur only if martial law had ended by that time, as reported by the New Voice of Ukraine:Elections in Ukraine will be held in 2024 only if martial law is ended by then, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an interview with the BBC on June 22.Zelenskyy emphasized that according to the Ukrainian constitution, no elections could be held in the country while martial law remains in effect.He expressed hope that there would be peace in Ukraine next year, and life would be returning to normal.Zelenskyy first declared martial law at the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces on Feb. 22, 2022. Zelenskyy most recently extended that declaration to August 30, 2023. Based on terms outlined in the Ukrainian Constitution, elections for Ukraine's parliamentary body the Verkhovna Rada and for the presidency cannot be held when martial law is imposed. A longstanding law passed by the Verkhovna Rada makes this explicit:Under martial law, the following are prohibited: [...] conducting elections of the President of Ukraine, as well as elections to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and local self-government bodies [...].The June 22, 2023, announcement was not the first time this issue has come up. In May 2023, the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) — the deliberative body behind the Council of Europe — strongly pressured Ukraine to hold elections as currently scheduled, as Ukrainian Pravda reported:PACE President Tiny Kox told European Pravda that Ukraine must hold parliamentary and presidential elections even while martial law is in effect. He stressed that the Ukrainian government must come up with ways to address this challenge.Kox admitted that the Ukrainian constitution does not allow [...] elections while martial law is in effect, but said that Ukraine has to ""find a solution"".""That is not up to us to say how to do it, but of course Ukraine has to organise free and fair elections,"" Kox said. He also stressed that Ukraine ""has to hold free and fair elections, because that is one obligation under the statute and under our conventions. And you will do so.""In response to that demand, Oleksii Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council (NSDC), expressed frustration that PACE was telling Ukraine to ignore its own constitution, as Ukrainian Pravda reported:I want to stress that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) has to realize that we have our own Constitution and our own laws, which we must observe. PACE would be better off doing other things, [for example] not allowing the Russian Federation to meddle in their affairs. We will handle this [i.e., the question of elections - ed.] ourselves, in accordance with our laws and our Constitution.

6078	Hundreds attended a church ceremony blessing AR-15s.	"On 28 February 2018, the Associated Press published photographs showing people wearing brightly colored robes and crowns (some of which appeared to have been crafted from bullets) carrying AR-15 firearms in what was termed a ""commitment ceremony."" The surreal scene showcased in the photographs prompted readers to inquire whether it was actually real:Worshippers clutching AR-15 rifles and some wearing bullet crowns, participated in a commitment ceremony today at World Peace and Unification Sanctuary, in Newfoundland, Pa. The event led a nearby school to cancel classes for the day. Photos @jacquelinelarma pic.twitter.com/GXzrZeK41z— AP Images (@AP_Images) February 28, 2018
The AP is a legitimate news agency, and — as reality is sometimes much stranger than fiction — this story and these photographs are authentic. They show roughly 600 members of the World Peace and Unification Sanctuary church in Newfoundland, Pennsylvania, considered by some to be a cult.The sect has undergone some rebranding since its heyday, but it is not new. It is an offshoot of the notorious Unification Church, perhaps best known for its adherents — who are sometimes colloquially called ""Moonies,"" after its late founder, Rev. Sun Myung Moon, described by RationalWiki as ""a nutjob from South Korea who claimed he was the Second Coming of Jesus.""His son, Rev. Sean Moon, oversees the Newfoundland congregation; his other son, Justin Moon, owns a gun manufacturing business — which sponsored the event, as reported by the Standard-Speaker:Moon, who refers to himself as the “Second King” and anointed heir to the “True Father,” urges followers to arm themselves to defend their families, their communities and “the nation of Cheon Il Guk,” the kingdom of God the church believes is prophesied in biblical Scripture.Through its Rod of Iron Ministries affiliate, the church also was among the sponsors for a pro-gun-rights “President Trump Thank You Dinner” this past Saturday in Matamoras, Pike County. Kahr Arms, a gun manufacturing company based in Greeley, Pike County, and owned by Moon’s brother, also was a sponsor of that event.The photographs were taken at a ceremony in which couples were asked to bring their ""rods of iron,” a phrase from the apocalyptic Book of Revelation in the New Testament that Moon has interpreted rather specifically to mean AR-15s. The Philadelphia Inquirer had still more about the event:The ceremony’s official name was the Cosmic True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humanity Cheon Il Guk Book of Life Registration Blessing. It was part of the church’s weeklong “Festival of Grace,” which included a “President Trump Thank You Dinner” on Saturday. Wednesday’s church ceremony garnered international attention because of the call for couples to bring AR-15s, a popular semi-automatic rifle that has been used in many of the nation’s worst mass shootings, including the Valentine’s Day massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.“The country is nervous,” said church follower Carolyn Burkholder, 70.Burkholder was adjusting a trigger lock on her AR-15 in the trunk of her car, near a child’s car seat. She wore a crown.“Some people see this gun, and they get scared,” she said. “I used to be scared a little.”The ceremony so spooked the community that the local school district closed a nearby elementary school and moved children to other locations that day."	true

4583	"Coronavirus stimulus payments, termed ""Economic Impact Payments,"" are taxable and could reduce your 2020 tax refund."	"U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law on March 27, 2020, in response to the unprecedented economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Among the provisions in this bill is authorization for the federal government to pay each U.S. citizen a one-time check, termed an ""economic impact payment.""In general terms, this is how the payments work:While the above metric is fairly straightforward, the CARES Act’s use of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) tax infrastructure to facilitate these payments has caused substantial confusion. That’s because legally the payment is considered a tax credit advanced to the recipient from the (future) 2020 tax return — that is, the return the recipient will file in 2021. This has led some to believe that the payment either needs to be paid back in full in 2020, or that the payment is considered taxable income, or that the payment counts against one's 2020 tax refund. None of these conclusions, however, is true.That’s because another provision written into the law dictates that recipients of the economic impact payment will be credited as if they had paid the government back. This makes the payment a non-taxable fund that does not affect future returns. ""What’s technically happening is that the person is due a 2020 stimulus rebate 'credit' — but that’s reduced by what they received as an advance credit this year, so it exactly cancels out,"" Chye-Ching Huang, senior director of economic policy at the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), told us via email. ""That just prevents duplicate refunds — there’s no practical impact on their 2020 tax refund.”While it is not possible for changes in your income to require repayment back to the government — i.e., if your 2020 taxable income ends up higher than it was in 2019 or 2018 — it is possible that you could get an additional amount of economic impact money after filing in 2021 if your economic situation worsens, Huang told us:One benefit of this structure is that it means people can get an extra stimulus credit amount in their 2020 refunds if their income falls in 2020 compared to prior years. Say an individual makes $100,000 in both 2018 and 2019. That’s above the income phase out threshold for the stimulus rebate, so they won’t be sent a stimulus payment immediately. But if this person loses their job in 2020 and so makes $75,000 in 2020, their 2020 income will be below the threshold for the stimulus rebate. So when they file their 2020 tax return in 2021, they will be eligible for a $1,200 stimulus rebate credit against 2020 taxes.In the opposite situation, when a person’s income in fact rises from 2018/2019 to 2020, they won’t have their refunds reduced in 2020 or face any other claw-back. Say an individual filed a 2018 tax return and made $75,000 and hasn’t filed a 2019 return yet. Then in each of 2019 and 2020 they make $100,000 (above the phase-out for the rebate for an individual). This individual should receive a stimulus payment of $1,200 immediately because the IRS will use their 2018 filing data in absence of a 2019 return. But when they file for 2019 and 2020, they will not be required to pay back the advance refund. Any tax refund they have for 2019 or 2020 won’t be reduced below what it would have been otherwise.""The most important thing to understand is that the rebate is a bonus amount. The stimulus payment won’t reduce tax refunds for 2020 (when people file in 2021) below what they would have been otherwise,” Huang told us.Some people online have claimed that receiving the economic impact payment is contingent on filling out the United States 2020 census. This is not true, according to the United States Census Bureau. Another area of concern is the government's ability to garnish these stimulus payments should they owe money via student loans or to the IRS. For the most part, according to The New York Times, the IRS has ""temporarily suspend[ed] nearly all efforts to garnish tax refunds to repay debts, including those to the I.R.S. itself."" The only possible exception concerns people who are behind on child support payments. ""Treasury is explicitly allowed to “intercept” (garnish) the stimulus rebate to offset against child support debt,” Huang told us. ""However, it cannot garnish the rebate for other types of federal debt, such as student loans.""For people that have filed tax returns that include direct-deposit information, the IRS says the payments will be made automatically. For those who have not provided this information in their returns, the IRS says that ""In the coming weeks, Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.""Once you receive that money, however, it is yours to keep.

"On March 10, 2023, the Silicon Valley Bank in Northern California failed after its stock value collapsed, causing a run on its holdings. Federal regulators assumed control of the company in was reportedly the largest failure of a U.S. bank since 2008. The incident sparked worries about the stability of the banking system overall. Naturally, the internet exploded with rumor and speculation about the incident, including, literally within hours of the bank announcement, the claim that a years-old episode of the animated TV series ""The Simpsons"" contained a scene that ""predicted"" the Silicon Valley Bank crash. But despite the circulation of a viral video clip that appears to reference Silicon Valley Bank by name, the claim is false, and the video clip was manipulated. This is the doctored clip in question:The clip was made using actual footage from a 1995 episode of ""The Simpsons"" entitled ""The PTA Disbands."" The scene in question, which is largely unchanged in the altered clip, was conceived a parody of the bank failure scene in the classic Jimmy Stewart film, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" In the manipulated version, the name ""First Bank of Springfield,"" which appeared in the original episode, was replaced with ""Silicon Valley Bank."" Here is the original, unaltered scene: "	false
721	It is a federal crime in the U.S. to enter a design in the Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest if waterfowl are not the dominant feature of the design.	"A popular twitter account, A Crime a Day, tweets every day about an obscure federal law in the U.S. One tweet focused on the longtime Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest. As described by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department:The Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest is one of the most successful conservation programs in our nation's history. Duck Stamps are vital tools for wetland conservation, with ninety-eight cents out of every dollar spent on Duck Stamps going directly to wetland habitat protection. Since its inception in 1934, sales of the Duck Stamp have generated over $1.1 billion that has conserved more than 6 million acres of wetland habitat for birds and other wildlife. In response to an alleged submission whose design was dominated by shark eating various waterfowl, A Crime A Day tweeted in early 2023 that it was ""a federal crime to enter a design in the Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest if waterfowl are not the dominant feature of the design.""This is incorrect. It is not a crime to enter a design in which eligible waterfowl are not dominant in the Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest. But it is against the contest's regulations, as explained in 50 CFR § 91.14: A live portrayal of any bird(s) of the five or fewer identified eligible waterfowl species must be the dominant feature of the design. The design may depict more than one of the eligible species. The judges' overall mandate is to select the best design that will make an interesting, useful, and attractive duck stamp that will be accepted and prized by hunters, stamp collectors, conservationists, and others.That regulation does not define a crime — it merely states that entries in which ""eligible waterfowl species"" are not ""the dominant feature of the design"" will be disqualified. The assertion of criminal penalties comes from incorrectly invoking two parts of the U.S. Criminal Code.These criminal codes have nothing to do with the Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest: 16 U.S. Code § 718a prohibits taking migratory waterfowl without ""a valid Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp,"" while 16 U.S. Code § 707a imposes penalties on people who violate provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty. "	false
934	"A meme shows the moment that John Lennon and Chuck Berry reacted to Yoko Ono ""screeching into the microphone"" during a 1972 appearance on ""The Mike Douglas Show."""	"On Jan. 14, 2023, the Rock Reflections Facebook page posted a meme that showed a still frame from a video with the caption, ""The very moment when Yoko Ono starts screeching into the microphone while John Lennon and Chuck Berry are performing on 'The Mike Douglas Show' in 1972.""Rock Reflections also added their own caption above the meme, which read, ""While Chuck may have that 'What the…..?' stare, it looks like John has that 'Oh crap, I forgot to tell him my wife was here' look on his face.""Was the still frame with Berry's wide-eyed reaction actually from a different part of the song? Was this meme in any way misleading?A check of the video showed that this meme was indeed a faithful representation of the moment.Beginning at the 16:05 mark below, readers can see that Berry's eyes go wide upon the first sounds that Ono made, while the band plays his hit, ""Memphis, Tennessee."" Lennon appeared to slightly react as well, looking slightly to Ono's direction, but not with quite the facial expression shown by Berry.At the 17:06 and 18:05 marks in the video, Ono can once again be seen singing into the microphone. However, she isn't audible for at least part of those two subsequent moments, but can barely be heard just as the song finishes.One YouTube user commented, ""Respect to the person who switched Yoko's mic off. They should be found and put in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame."" It's unclear if the microphone was truly switched off. Nevertheless, Ono could not be heard, at least not loudly, after the first bout of ""screeching.""On the same subject, stand-up comedian Bill Burr once joked about the moment on his podcast, ""Monday Morning Podcast."" A YouTube user edited together the audio from Burr's podcast with footage from the 1972 appearance on ""The Mike Douglas Show."""	true
2102	A family in Kentucky at one point had a blue tint to their skin.	"For years, people have posted images and stories on the internet about a family from Kentucky who had blue-colored skin. Understandably, some viewers have questioned whether these stories and images were real. Here's an example of one post on the platform Twitter in 2022:We'll start by saying that, yes, the Fugate family line that originated in a secluded region known as Troublesome Creek, east of Louisville, Kentucky, in the Appalachian Mountains, did have a blue hue to their skin. The story of that family, known as the ""Blue Fugates,"" has been well-documented. They carried a rare blood disorder called methemoglobinemia, which affects how the blood carries and releases oxygen. In the Fugates, it didn't harm their physical health (the family was noted for its longevity), but it did cause their skin to turn blue as the result of their blood cells carrying less oxygen (oxygenated blood is bright red and, in some white people, gives skin a pink undertone).The trait was carried on a recessive gene, meaning in order to pass it on, both parents had to be carrying the gene. It persisted for generations because the region the family lived in was isolated. But in the modern era, with the building of roads, that is no longer the case, and the gene pool has been dispersed. The last known ""blue"" Fugate descendant was born in 1975."	true
6232	"Fox News Channel was banned in Australia and New Zealand after being deemed ""propaganda."""	"In late January 2018, a social media rumor claimed that Fox News Channel, whose programming is often criticized for conservative political bias, was banned in Australia and New Zealand after being deemed ""propaganda.""Claims abruptly materialized on Facebook and Twitter enthusiastically parroting the claim despite a complete lack of media coverage on the topic:New Zealand and Australia have banned Fox News saying it does not fit in their democracies. They say it is propaganda. Smart countries. The U.S. is sinking fast under the Dictatorship of Trump and the Republicans in the eyes of the world.— Bonnie Swadling (@bonnie_swadling) January 25, 2018@FoxNews is banned in Australia and New Zealand because it is classified as propaganda.— Darla (@ukfan01) January 25, 2018

We found no posts citing any sources to corroborate this claim.We were also unable to confirm the underlying assertion that Fox News has been deemed ""propaganda"" by officials of either country, nor did we find precedents for the banning of specific news organizations on that ground.Although neither Australia nor New Zealand guarantees the freedom of the press as a constitutional right, the High Court of Australia has ruled it an ""implied right"" under that country's constitution and in New Zealand freedom of the press is guaranteed by ""convention and statute,"" according to the human rights watchdog group Freedom House. We asked Ursula Cheer, a New Zealand law professor specializing in censorship and media issues, if there is any basis in that country's laws for banning a news station outright, and she assured us there is not:Our broadcasters are bound by codes which include requirements of accuracy and fairness and require content to be lawful and not discriminate or denigrate, but the codes operate to allow public complaint after a programme has gone to air, not before. Successful complaints have been made against one or two of our fundamentalist TV channels for forms of incitement. The Broadcasting Standards Authority which deals with broadcasting complaints actually has the power to shut down a channel for up to 24 hours, but that is the worst it can do, and it has only exercised that power twice in its history. Otherwise it is reprimands, fines and compensation.We also took a simple step to check the channel listings of the main pay television providers in Australia and New Zealand. Fox News Channel is still among their offerings. Australia's Foxtel cable and satellite television company offers Fox News on channel 604. New Zealand's Sky Network Television offers it on channel 088. We contacted representatives of both companies who were kind enough to confirm that they do, in fact, carry the channel.""Such-and-such a country banned Fox News"" has become a familiar social media trope in recent years. A 2011 variant of the rumor held (falsely) that the Fox News Channel was banned in Canada for running afoul of Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CTRC) regulations prohibiting the broadcasting of ""false or misleading news."""	false

3916	"Photographs show a road traffic warning sign that reads: ""Do Not Let Moose Lick Your Car."""	"On Nov. 14, 2020, a set of photographs supposedly showing a traffic sign in Canada warning passersby to ""not let moose lick your car"" went viral on social media:These pictures stirred up some questions. Are these signs real? How exactly do you stop a moose from doing what a moose wants to do? And, just how widespread is the moose-licking-car problem in Canada?First of all, these pictures are real. This sign was spotted along Maligne Lake Road in Jasper, Alberta, Canada. And while the sign may seem a bit humorous, it addresses a genuine problem in the National Parks of Canada. Moose, apparently, are somewhat obsessed with salt. Jue Urie, the owner-operator of the Jasper Tour Company, told the CBC:  ""Road salt is kind of like crack [to moose].""In the winter when roads are salted to prevent them from freezing, moose have figured out that the salt can be easily accessed on the front bumpers of parked cars. So when people stop to look at a moose, or when cars are simply parked in the area, these large animals can get dangerously close to the vehicles in order to get a taste of salt. Fitzhugh.ca, a news website serving the Jasper area, talked to Jasper National Park spokesman Steve Young about the issue. Young said: “(This) started as an occasional issue a few years ago and now is too common ... People are getting far too close, and it’s perpetuated by their (the moose’s) obsession with salt, accessing the vehicles.""Here's a video news report from 2016 about moose licking cars in Alberta, Canada:In 2016, during a similar spate of salt-licking moose incidents, Alberta Parks issued a warning to visitors to not let moose lick their cars. That warning had some specific strategies to deter this practice, such as honking the car horn, as well as some techniques to avoid, such as ""do not attempt to push the moose away from your vehicle."""	true
1735	A photograph shows a statue guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier that was knocked over by vandals.	"In April 2018, a meme featuring a toppled statue was posted to the Facebook page ""The Voice of the People"" with the claim that it was knocked over by vandals near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier:This is a genuine photograph of an overturned statue, but the accompanying text is inaccurate. The information contained in this meme was taken directly from a 1 May 2017 (not 2018) Facebook post:One of the statues guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier monument has been pushed over by vandals at the Veterans Plaza in Longview! Was not young children who did this!This text claims that this photograph was taken at the ""Tomb of the Unknown Soldier"" at the Veterans Plaza in Longview, Texas. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, however, is located at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. There is a Veterans Plaza in Longview, Texas, but none of the monuments at this memorial carry that name.The Longview Journal, one of the first outlets to report on the statue's fate, noted the mistake in Applewhite's post:Officials with the group who oversees the plaza later said the destroyed statue is not that of the Unknown Soldier, but that it represents every service member.The claim that this statue was ""pushed over by vandals"" and that those alleged vandals were ""not young children"" is also unverified. Local police officers were reportedly investigating the incident as an act of vandalism, but we have encountered no reports about an arrest related to this statue's destruction, nor any photographs or video showing the alleged vandals knocking the statue over. It also appears that the claim that this was an act of vandalism was merely an unverified assumption. We reached out to the Longview Police Department and were told that the investigation was ended due to a lack of evidence:We did investigate but had no information or leads and so at this point the case has been suspended.Sergeant R. Shane McCarter confirmed to us that a suspect was never identified but added that the police department believed the statue was intentionally toppled:The statue was replaced by the Veterans Recognition Foundation. The suspect was not identified nor have there been any witnesses to identify the suspect. We did take the report as a criminal mischief and do believe it was an intentional act.Although this statue may have truly been vandalized, it's also possible that it was an accident or the inevitable result of a structural weakness:Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any news on who could have ruined the statue, nor if this was definitely an act of vandalism. Some are speculating that it could have been the result of a structural failure in a weak part of the sculpture.Regardless of how this statue met its demise, it was replaced within a few months:It troubled Tim Hood when he read reports of a statue destroyed by vandals at an entrance to the Veterans Plaza at Longview's Teague Park.The grand vice chancellor of the Longview lodge of the Knights of Pythias is not a veteran, but like many in his shoes, he respects the Americans who defended his freedom and are honored in the walk-through memorial.""We had a meeting that night, so I took it to the lodge,"" Hood said Friday morning after handing the fruits of that discussion — a $1,000 check — to Veterans Recognition Foundation leaders Billy Clay and Gail Jurkowski.Richard Jurkowski, Executive Director of the Veterans Recognition Foundation, told us in an email that the viral meme was spreading misinformation but insisted that the statue was destroyed in an act of vandalism:Whoever made the initial posting did not have al the information correct.The statue was of a soldier on guard - he was not guarding the tomb of the unknown soldier. There is a monument nearby with the poem ""Because of You, Unknown Soldier"" By Courtney Tanabe and that might be where the person got the idea.The toppling and destruction of the statue was absolutely vandalism. It would have taken a truck and a chain to topple it and break it in pieces the way it was."	false

"Despite a header clearly identifying it as ""satire,"" an article attributing fictitious quotes about President Trump's mental fitness to one of his sisters, Maryanne Trump Barry, prompted queries from readers as it made the social media rounds in January 2018.The web site Nova Magazine, which appears to specialize in a mixture of news and unfunny political satire, published the article. Here is an excerpt:Trump’s older sister is not happy about the behavior of her little brother, the President of the United States.Maryanne Trump Barry, Donald Trump’s older sister and a United States Circuit Judge, told reporters over the weekend, “Donnie’s not acting right. ”The 80-year-old also says she believes that President Trump might be forgetting to take his pills.“I don’t recognize the Donnie who’s in the White House right now,” added Judge Trump Barry, who friends describe as very loyal to her younger brother.“Donnie was never a smart boy, no matter what he tells you. In fact, the neighborhood kids used to call him ‘Donnie Dimwit.’ But recently he seems to be operating at an even lower IQ, and that’s not good for the country.”Although Trump does have two older sisters, one of whom is inactive Senior Circuit Court Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, apart from reportedly likening him to P.T. Barnum on a past occasion she has not been known to criticize her brother Donald in public — and certainly has said nothing on the order of the disparaging statements attributed to her in this article.The spoof was apparently inspired by the release of the Michael Wolff exposé Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which asserts that some of President Trump's own aides question the 71-year-old's mental stability and competence. The provenance and accuracy of some of Wolff's claims have been questioned by other journalists.His fitness for office has been defended by White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who called him an ""incredibly strong and good leader,"" and by Trump himself, who issued a tweet saying he qualifies as a genius, ""and a very stable genius at that!"""	false
1821	"Walmart temporarily sold a shirt bearing the words ""Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some Assembly Required."""	"Amid a climate of hostility toward the mainstream news media from President Donald Trump and some of his supporters, further controversy appeared in November 2017 when the retail giant Walmart was accused of selling a shirt bearing a slogan alluding to hanging journalists:Rope. Tree. Journalist.
Some Assembly Required.The shirt is real and it was temporarily available for sale on Walmart's online store. It is made by the third-party seller Teespring.com. Walmart removed it on 30 November 2017, a day after the Radio Television Digital News Association (a nonprofit group that represents broadcast and digital journalists) wrote to Walmart executives requesting it be taken down.  RTDNA executive director Dan Shelley wrote:It is our belief that at the least, T-Shirts or any other items bearing such words simply inflame the passions of those who either don’t like, or don’t understand, the news media. At worst, they openly encourage violence targeting journalists.

3506	Nathan Gilroy, who graduated from MIT, invented Powersave, an energy-saving device meant to reduce household electricity bills.	"When a product takes on more than one name and has an elusive backstory, it raises some questions. And we faced a big question mark surrounding the identity of Nathan Gilroy, a personality who had been widely touted on Facebook as an ""inventor,"" but had no real credentials available to back him up, nor much of an online presence to begin with.Ads for the so-called ""Powersave"" device had been circulating on Facebook in late 2020, describing how a young ""genius"" named Nathan Gilroy had invented an energy-saving device that would reduce electricity costs in homes by 50%.A video shows a young teen, purportedly an 18-year-old Gilroy, who allegedly grew up in ""the poorest neighborhood of St. Louis."" The video claims his device is helping poor families across America who are struggling with electricity bills. Elsewhere, a number of websites shared ""facts"" about him, claiming that Gilroy graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) at a young age.There were a number of red flags in the meager information available about Gilroy. Firstly, throughout the video, the young teen does not speak. All the information is conveyed through text overlaid on video, and what appear to be spliced together images and clips that could have been pulled from a range of sources. Even the people offering testimonials about the product are simply talking, voiceless heads on the screen with overlaid text purportedly quoting them.But to determine whether Gilroy the inventor was a real person behind this device, we reached out to MIT. A representative from its media relations team pointed out that university officials ""typically don't definitively confirm that a person did not attend MIT, as there can be situations where someone enrolled under a different name or participated in a special program."" They did, however, check with the MIT Registrar's Office in this case, and found there was no record of an individual with the name Nathan Gilroy having been an enrolled MIT student.There is very little else about him available online. Given that key parts of Gilroy's identity and credentials are impossible to confirm, his educational background is outright falsified, and the promotional material around him appears deliberately deceptive, we have concluded that such a person does not exist.In August 2023, a number of Facebook videos emerged, promoting the device again, but this time the so-called inventor was a man named ""Noah Watson"" and his device was called ""BoldHero."" The videos had repurposed the same old clips showed the young man speaking and appearing to give an interview, but we still cannot hear him. This time, his backstory claimed he grew up poor in Jacksonville, Florida, and was raised by a single mother before he went to Harvard. Ultimately the videos seek to promote the same device under a different story and name. But is the device just a scam? Described as a ""smart device plugged into socket,"" and a ""voltage stabilizer,"" it apparently conserves electricity, but no details are offered about the device's mechanisms that allow it to do this. It also goes by different names online. One website called it ElectroPro  while others called  it ""Power saver."" Amazon shared a version of the device labelled ""Powersave."" Facebook videos from August 2023 called it ""BoldHero"" and the device was also available on Amazon under that name, as of this writing. Most Amazon reviews say the device is useless, or a ""total scam."" Scamadvisor, a popular YouTube channel, called it a ""complete waste of money"" and said the product they ordered looked completely different from how it was advertised."	false
2531	Researchers at Cleveland Clinic began a phase I study in October 2021 to test the safety of a vaccine aimed at preventing the most aggressive form of breast cancer.	After two decades of research, experts at the Cleveland Clinic announced the beginning of a human clinical trial to test the safety of a vaccine to potentially prevent triple-negative breast cancer, the most aggressive form of the disease.In an Oct. 26, 2021, news release, the nonprofit medical center noted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the investigational drug application in partnership with Anixa Biosciences, Inc., a biotech company focused on cancer and infectious diseases. Scientists at the clinic’s Lerner Research Institute launched the Phase I study, which is aimed at determining the highest dose that can be given safely without causing severe side effects, in October 2021. These tests follow laboratory tests and animal studies, and predate phase II clinical trials to determine the efficacy rates, according to the American Cancer Society.“We are hopeful that this research will lead to more advanced trials to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine against this highly aggressive type of breast cancer,” said Dr. G. Thomas Budd, of the clinic’s Taussig Cancer Institute. “Long term, we are hoping that this can be a true preventive vaccine that would be administered to healthy women to prevent them from developing triple-negative breast cancer, the form of breast cancer for which we have the least effective treatments.”Triple-negative breast cancer represents between 12% and 15% of all breast cancers, but it accounts for a disproportionate number of deaths associated with the disease because it does not have specific receptors commonly found in breast cancer.“Think of cancer cells as a house. The front door may have three kinds of locks, called receptors,” wrote the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These “locks” include the female hormones estrogen and progesterone as well as a protein called human epidermal growth factor (HER2).“If your cancer has any of these three locks, doctors have a few keys (like hormone therapy or other drugs) they can use to help destroy the cancer cells. But if you have triple-negative breast cancer, it means those three locks aren’t there.”In short, specialists have “fewer keys” they can turn to for treatment.But the new vaccine is aimed at adding another key to the chain by preventing breast cancer before it occurs, particularly in the more aggressive forms of the disease. This is done by targeting a lactation protein, α-lactalbumin, that is only expressed when a woman is lactating. As a woman ages, this protein normally wanes but a majority of women diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer retain the protein. The vaccine works by activating the immune system against the “retired” protein to provide “preemptive immune protection against emerging breast tumors that express α-lactalbumin. An adjuvant (a substance added to enhance the body's immune response) included in the vaccine also prompts the immune system to respond to potential emerging tumors before they grow.The new study is based on research published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Medicine, which found α-lactalbumin protein was safe and effective in preventing breast tumors in mice, and a single dose could both prevent tumors from forming and inhibit the growth of those already existing.The funding is set to be completed in September 2022 and will follow between 18 and 24 patients who have finished treatment for early-stage triple-negative breast cancer within the past three years. Though test subjects will be tumor-free at the time of the study, they are at a high risk for recurrence. Three vaccine doses will be given two weeks apart.If the phase I study is successful, researchers hope to test the vaccine in cancer-free women who are at a high risk for developing breast cancer, typically those who carry mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene — both of which have been identified as risk factors for breast cancer.	true

After whittling down the pool of men each week, the object of their affections is ultimately expected to decide whether or not to start a family with one of the men, or continue to take her chances in the real world. ""Compete to impregnate a woman"" might seem a somewhat crude synopsis of the show's premise, but then Fox's own website promoted ""Labor of Love"" as ""FOX levels up dating to mating by taking viewers along on one woman’s unconventional journey toward potential love and motherhood.""The show's first, eight-episode season culminated on July 16, 2020. It was hosted by former ""Sex and the City"" actor Kristin Davis, and the woman at the center of the show was Kristy Katzmann, who was an unsuccessful contestant on the 11th season of ""The Bachelor,"" in 2007.""Labor of Love"" proved controversial from the outset.

2692	In September 2021, the ride-sharing company Lyft expressed opposition to new abortion restrictions in Texas and announced a legal defense fund for affected drivers.	"In September 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the implementation of a controversial Texas state law that effectively bans most abortions, prompting an outraged response among Democrats, pro-choice activists, celebrities, and some sectors of corporate America. Texas Senate Bill (S.B.) 8, signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on May 19 and implemented on Sept. 1, bans any and all abortions after the ""first detectable heartbeat"" of a fetus, an event that can take place as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It also allows a private citizen to sue any woman who undergoes an abortion after this point, or anyone who assists her, regardless of whether the citizen has any personal connection to those individuals.According to a widely shared Facebook post, one of the major U.S. companies to announce its opposition to the law was the ride-sharing app Lyft. On Sept. 4, Facebook user Izabella Kordalewski posted what appeared to be a screenshot of a letter from the company, addressed to ""Lyft riders and drivers,"" criticizing S.B. 8 as ""incompatible with people's basic rights to privacy.""The letter also promised to provide financial assistance to Lyft drivers who become caught up in the enforcement of the law by transporting women who are on their way to obtain an abortion, in potential violation of S.B. 8. Kordalewski introduced the letter by writing, ""Dear friends. Here is a screenshot of an email I received from Lyft yesterday. Go make good choices."" The letter itself read as follows:Dear Lyft Riders and Drivers,A new Texas law, SB8, threatens to punish drivers for getting people where they need to go - specifically, women exercising their right to choose and to access the healthcare they need.We want to be clear: Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why.

I urgently draw your attention to important issues related to the next vaccination against Covid-19. For the first time in the history of vaccination, the so-called latest-generation mRNA vaccines directly interfere with the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material, which is genetic manipulation, which was already prohibited and was previously considered to be a crime.Kennedy, who has never been a senator, never made the above statement, nor did he win a Supreme Court case regarding ""universal vaccination."" Further, the Supreme Court has not appreciably ""overturned"" any vaccination precedent in over a century, and mRNA vaccines do not ""alter an individual's genetic material.""In reality, these 2021 viral posts on social media are an amalgamation of misleading viral claims derived from an anti-vaccine group's 2018 settlement of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit and from a bit of copypasta that went viral in October and November 2020.The Supreme Court has never ruled on ""universal vaccination."" The Supreme Court's position on ""compulsory vaccination"" — the idea that a state has the power to compel vaccination through fines, civil penalties, or exclusion from certain public services like schools — was set well over a century ago and has not been ""overturned.""In the 1905 case Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court ruled that, ""It is within the police power of a State to enact a compulsory vaccination law."" Even though it is old, as the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health explained in November 2020, ""this continues to be the benchmark case on the state’s power to mandate vaccination.""The ""lawsuit filed by a group of scientists led by … Kennedy"" that allegedly demonstrated that the U.S government is ""failing to prove all of their vaccines over the past 32 years were safe"" refers to a case in the Southern District of New York between the anti-vaccine Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) and the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that was settled in 2018.That case revolved around a FOIA request made by ICAN for congressionally mandated biennial safety reports about vaccines. Their FOIA search turned up no records, and ICAN — with Kennedy's help —  fought for a settlement in which the HHS stated that fact in writing. That case has been used to assert, falsely, that no safety testing on vaccines has been, or is being, completed. Regardless, it was not a Supreme Court case, and it did not overturn the Supreme Court precedent set in Jacobson v. Massachusetts.Kennedy has a long and well-documented history of making false and conspiratorial claims about vaccines. His Instagram page, which spread unhinged claims about 5G wireless technology, Bill Gates, and microchips, was banned in February 2020 for spreading vaccine misinformation.That being said, the quote from Kennedy is apocryphal. It first appeared in a copypasta post Snopes debunked in November 2020. With respect to the quote about how the vaccine should be avoided at all costs because ""mRNA vaccines directly interfere with the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material,"" Kennedy told us that:""I never made those underlying assertions [in the viral post] and I don’t believe them to be factually accurate. … Many forums have reposted it and we have been playing whack-a-mole trying to get them to remove it.""In fact, mRNA vaccines, as we explained in our earlier fact check, do not alter a human's genetic code and are incapable of doing so, as the material injected is physically unable to cross into the nucleus of a cell. That article also covers several other false scientific claims sometimes included with the ""Supreme Court overturned universal vaccination"" post."	false
513	The Masai Tribe donated 14 cows to the United States after 9/11.	"A popular meme holding that Kenyan Masai tribe members donated 14 cows to the United States in the wake of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack is frequently posted on social media: Although this meme is accurate, its brief text brings up a few questions:  Did the Masai ship the cows to the United States? Were the cows meant to be a food source? Were they taken to the White House? The story of the Masai and their 14 cows begins with Kimeli Naiyomah, a member of the tribe who left Kenya to study medicine in the United States. After the September 11th attacks, Naiyomah returned to Kenya, where he told the tribespeople, many of whom were unaware of the incident, about 9/11. The New York Times reported in 2002: ... [W]hen Kimeli Naiyomah returned recently to this tiny village from his studies in the United States, he found only the vaguest understanding among his fellow Masai of what had happened in that far-away place called New York on Sept. 11.Some in this nomadic community of cattle raisers had missed the story entirely. ''I never knew about Sept. 9,'' said William Oltetia, chief of the young warriors known here as morans, who was still confused as to the date. ''I just never heard about it.''Most Masai had learned of the attacks from the radio soon after they occurred. But the horrible television images passed by many Masai, who got electricity in their village only shortly before the attacks. In the oral tradition they rely on, Mr. Naiyomah sat them down and told them stories that stunned them.The Masai, saddened by the tragedy and relieved that Naiyomah had not been hurt, wanted to show solidarity with the United States. They decided to donate cows, an animal they hold sacred. On 1 June 2002, the Masai held a ceremony in the village of Enoosaen, where tribe elders presented U.S. Ambassador to Kenya William Brencick with 14 cows. The BBC reported at the time:The cattle - regarded as sacred by the Masai - were handed over to William Brancick, deputy head of the US embassy in Kenya in a remote village near the border with Tanzania.The ceremony was marked by tribespeople in traditional red robes and jewellery, some of whom carried banners saying ""To the people of America, we give these cows to help you"".Brencick called the gift the ""highest expression of regard and sympathy.""''The cow is almost the center of life for us,'' Naiyomah explained. ''It's sacred. It's more than property. You give it a name. You talk to it. You perform rituals with it. I don't know if you have any sacred food in America, something that has a supernatural feel as you eat it. That's the cow for us.''However, logistical constraints prevented the animals from actually being transported to the U.S. It wasn't until 2006 that American diplomats finally decided to use the cows to start an education fund:American diplomats flirted with the idea of shipping the animals to the Central Park Zoo. That proved too complicated. Then someone suggested selling them and using the proceeds to buy Masai jewelry for New Yorkers. But that seemed a little heartless.The indecision went on and on, and by Year 3, some of the Masai were feeling spurned. The cattle were growing fat — and going nowhere. In Masai culture, it is disrespectful to dillydally over such a gift.[...]On Sunday, American diplomats returned to this town in the carpeted hills of southern Kenya and announced, much to the delight of the hundreds of Masai gathered in their best beaded finery, that the cattle were not going anywhere, especially not to the slaughterhouse.Instead, they will be blessed, and their offspring will be used to pay for education for the children of Enoosaen. To get the cow trust fund going, the Americans are donating 14 high school scholarships.""What you did to help us will not be forgotten,"" said the new American ambassador to Kenya, Michael E. Ranneberger.The Masai elders, some sitting in monkey skin jackets, beamed.""We did what we knew best,"" said an elder, Mzee ole Yiamboi. ""The handkerchief we give to people to wipe their tears with is a cow.""The cows were each branded with a symbol resembling the twin towers on their ears. According to the book 14 Cows for America, the ""American cows"" multiplied and numbered 35 at the time of its publication in 2009.Here's a video report about the Masai Tribe's gift after 9/11: "	true
1386	"The state of Pennsylvania recorded ""205,000 votes more than they had voters"" in the 2020 U.S. election."	"Among the copious false claims about election fraud that U.S. President Donald Trump made after losing the 2020 presidential election to challenger Joe Biden was the assertion that the state of Pennsylvania had found they recorded ""205,000 votes more than they had voters"":The apparent source of the misinformation amplified by Trump was a news release issued by Pennsylvania State Rep. Frank Ryan on Dec. 28, maintaining that a comparison of ""county election results to the total number of voters who voted"" in Pennsylvania revealed a discrepancy of over 203,000 ballots:A comparison of official county election results to the total number of voters who voted on November 3, 2020 as recorded by the Department of State shows that 6,962,607 total ballots were reported as being cast, while DoS/SURE system records indicate that only 6,760,230 total voters actually voted. Among the 6,962,607 total ballots cast, 6,931,060 total votes were counted in the presidential race, including all three candidates on the ballot and write-in candidates.The difference of 202,377 more votes cast than voters voting, together with the 31,547 over- and under-votes in the presidential race, adds up to an alarming discrepancy of 170,830 votes, which is more than twice the reported statewide difference between the two major candidates for President of the United States.However, the Pennsylvania Department of State (DoS) issued a statement noting that the numbers obtained from the Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (SURE) system by Ryan were not accurate because they were based on incomplete data. As the DoS observed, ""a few counties have not completed uploading their vote histories,"" and that those as-yet-unreported numbers ""would account for a significant number of voters"":In today’s release Rep. Ryan and others rehash, with the same lack of evidence and the same absence of supporting documentation, repeatedly debunked conspiracy theories regarding the November 3 election. State and federal judges have sifted through hundreds of pages of unsubstantiated and false allegations and found no evidence of fraud or illegal voting.Now, the legislators have given us another perfect example of the dangers of uninformed, lay analysis combined with a basic lack of election administration knowledge.For instance, it is quite common to have significant ""undervotes"" for down-ballot races in a presidential election, particularly when there isn't a U.S. Senate race on the ballot. In 2000, Sen. Santorum received 200,000 more votes than President Bush, but the US Senate race still had more than 100,000 fewer votes than the presidential race.We are unclear as to what data the legislators used for this most recent “analysis.” But the only way to determine the number of voters who voted in November from the SURE system is through the vote histories. At this time, there are still a few counties that have not completed uploading their vote histories to the SURE system. These counties, which include Philadelphia, Allegheny, Butler and Cambria, would account for a significant number of voters. The numbers certified by the counties, not the uploading of voter histories into the SURE system, determines the ultimate certification of an election by the secretary.This obvious misinformation put forth by Rep. Ryan and others is the hallmark of so many of the claims made about this year’s presidential election. When exposed to even the simplest examination, courts at every level have found these and similar conspiratorial claims to be wholly without basis.To put it simply, this so-called analysis was based on incomplete data."	false
1202	"Unexplained jumps in vote totals due to large ""ballot drops"" led to Democratic victories in several 2022 U.S. midterm elections."	"During the 2020 presidential election, far-right conspiracy blog The Gateway Pundit aggressively pushed the notion, still championed by former U.S. President Donald Trump two years later, that nefarious ""dumps"" or ""drops"" of allegedly illegitimate ballots pushed Democratic candidates over the edge to win in several contests. Such assertions characterize the fact that absentee ballots —  whose use the GOP has aggressively shunned since 2020  — take longer to count and swing Democratic as evidence of fraud.Prior to Election Day 2022, many experts suggested that bad actors would frame the addition of mailed ballots to a vote count as evidence of fraud. The Gateway Pundit, after initially declaring victory, predictably delivered these unfounded talking points after it became clear their expectations had not been met. From a terminology standpoint, The Gateway Pundit rebranded ""ballot dumps'' as ""drop and roll"" events, but they refer to the largely illusory concept:One of the major ways in which the 2020 Election for President was stolen was the method The Gateway Pundit identified and labeled ""The Drop and Roll"". In the Drop and Roll incidents identified in the 2020 election, we found that at around the point where 90% of the expected ballots were returned, a large batch of ballots was ""dropped"" with nearly every ballot for Joe Biden.The Gateway Pundit alleged that ""drop and rolls"" occurred in several states during the 2022 election including in Michigan, Colorado, Minnesota, and Georgia. ""In the Michigan race there were two batches dropped for Gretchen Whitmer that put her in the lead in the race after she had been trailing for hours,"" the outlet claimed.""In [Rep. Lauren] Boebert's House race [in Colorado], there were two large drops of ballots that placed the Democrat running against Boebert in the lead,"" The Gateway Pundit alleged. ""In the Minnesota race for Governor, a large batch of ballots for Minnesota governor Tim Walz occurred that placed him in the lead,"" and ""In the Georgia Senate race, a large batch of ballots for Georgia Democrat Senator Warnock was dropped that placed him in the lead,"" the website claimed.Each of these nearly identical stories makes the same assertion: ""These results were not random and clearly not legitimate."" The Gateway Pundit provides no evidence, outside of the fact that their preferred candidates did not receive them, that these counted ballots are illegitimate.""Drop and roll"" claims rely on the assertion that large jumps in total vote count and the largely  Democratic skew of those jumps are unexplained phenomena. This is false. The reality is quite simple: Mail-in ballots take longer to count and the de facto head of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, has spent nearly three years telling his supporters to avoid mail-in voting. Prior to being fed into voting machines, poll workers need to manually open ballot envelopes and verify, among other things, their signatures. This delay is compounded, in some cases, thanks to legislation that forbids poll workers from counting or in some cases even processing ballots before polls close. Such a setup ensures a lag between the time in-person votes are first cast and when absentee ballots first register.Elections are run differently in each state and even each county. In some cases, larger electoral jurisdictions handle the processing of mail-in ballots from several smaller jurisdictions. Such a reality makes it appear that these votes are ""dumped"" into the totals, but has no bearing on the legitimacy of those votes.That many states' mail-in ballots skew toward Democrats is also unsurprising. Since April 2020, Trump has waged an aggressive campaign against the use of mail-in ballots. ""I think that mailing voting is a terrible thing,"" Trump said in April 2020. ""I think if you vote, you should go [to the polls]. In that election, 59% of Democrats voted by mail, whereas only 30% of Republicans did the same. The GOP rhetoric against mail-in balloting has not softened since then. ""The lasting impact of his claims has led to stark differences between how Democrats and Republicans view mail voting,"" the Los Angeles Times reported in October 2022.In sum, both the presence of large jumps in vote totals and the political distribution of those votes have clear and commonly understood explanations. Those sowing doubt about the legitimacy of the American electoral process claim that the aforementioned jumps in votes positively affect only Democratic candidates. ""The drops were always in favor of the Democrat candidate,"" The Gateway Pundit asserted in its multiple ""drop and roll"" posts. This suggestion is manifestly false.As New York Times reporter Stewart Thompson pointed out, some jumps in vote total during the 2022 election massively favored the GOP candidate, including one that benefited pro-Trump Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. ""This jump is for Kari Lake!"" he tweeted, ""yet the streamers have totally ignored it. Meanwhile they point to identical spikes in Minnesota and Michigan as 'clear fraud.'""As was the case in 2020, these 2022 election claims weaponize well-understood voting phenomena as supposed evidence of fraud by asserting that ""drops"" of ballots are mysterious or unexplained. Because that is not the case, the claim is false.   "	false

However, in this case, Musk's ""Go @Eagles!!!"" tweet was real. It temporarily appeared on Musk's account the night of the Super Bowl, Feb. 12, and it was deleted hours later, after the Chiefs won. For that reason, we rated this claim ""True.""[See also: Did Elon Musk Sit with Rupert Murdoch at Super Bowl LVII?]According to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, Musk's ""Go @Eagles!!!"" tweet was live for at least four hours, including for an unknown amount of time after the Kansas City Chiefs won the game around 10:15 p.m. (EST).The same page capture from the Wayback Machine showed that, about 3.5 hours later, Musk also tweeted ""GG Kansas City @Chiefs !!"" and described Rihanna's halftime show with two fire emojis.

207	Humans share 50% of their DNA with bananas.	"Claims regarding 50% genetic similarity, while likely overstated, are based on a comparison of similarly functioning genes, not the specific DNA sequences that make up the human genome. A popular ""science fact"" on the internet dating back decades contains some variation of the assertion that, from a genetic standpoint, a human and a banana are 50% similar. There are memes and shirts, too:On June 28, 2023, the claim appeared on the feed of the potentially misnamed Twitter account @Fact, which purports to provide ""Interesting facts about life"" to its 3.1 million followers: Humans share 50% of their DNA with bananas.— Fact (@Fact) June 28, 2023Though commonly repeated, there is no scenario in which ""humans and bananas share 50% of their DNA"" could be interpreted as a factual statement. Part of the problem is terminology. The earliest iteration of the claim that Snopes can identify dates to a 2001 PBS Nova episode about the Human Genome Project. In that episode, however, the phrasing is different. Instead of an assertion of shared DNA, the discussion — with MIT scientist Eric Lander — regards sharing the same genes: (PBS Nova)As Mark Peplow of the Royal Science Media Centre wrote in a comment to New Scientist back in 2003, genetic similarity depends on how it is defined. A broad definition (genes that perform the same function) and a narrow definition (identical DNA sequences) make for wildly different comparisons:Apparently ""modern inhabitants of Paris… share an average of 50 per cent of their genes with people from Baghdad."" Compare this with the frequently cited statistic: ""Humans share 50 per cent of their genes with a banana."" Does this mean that the residents of Baghdad are bananas?This is a common source of confusion, and no wonder. There are many different ways of comparing genetic similarity. The often quoted fact that people are genetically nearly identical to chimps, for example, comes from the analysis of amino acids coded for by just a couple of genes that we share with chimps. 98 per cent of those amino acids are the same.The 50 percent figure for people and bananas roughly means that half of our genes have counterparts in bananas. For example, both of us have some kind of gene that codes for cell growth, though these aren't necessarily made up of the same DNA sequences.Fifty percent, even by that broader definition, is a potentially suspect figure, and it does not appear to come from any published research. In December 2020, computational biologist Natasha Glover wrote a blog post detailing her efforts to track down the source of the rumor and evaluate its scientific validity. Her methods were designed to get the highest possible similarity, but the highest result she achieved was only 25%:To understand how much of the genome is conserved between banana and human, I will look at proteins because it's the feature most likely to be conserved [i.e. unchanged by evolution] between human and banana. This is to be as permissive as possible in attempts to give the benefit of the doubt to the 50% meme.Now the question is, how do we compare all the proteins in one species to all the proteins in another species and see which ones ""match"", i.e. descended from a common ancestral gene? This is a fundamental problem important for studying evolution. Orthologs are the term we use for genes in different species that started diverging due to a speciation event, i.e. ""corresponding"" genes between species. This is where our lab's [The Dessimoz Lab at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland] expertise comes in: we maintain Orthologous Matrix, which is a method and database for finding orthologs between many species. [...] All the orthology-inference methods tested show a maximum of 25% of human genes to be orthologous to banana. More to the point of the claim, however, is what percent of DNA is ""identical"" in both human and banana. Based on comparisons of whole genome pairs between humans and zebrafish (which are much more closely related to humans than bananas), Glover argued, the shared DNA figure would be well below 1%. "	false
5110	A photograph shows a young woman flying with President Bill Clinton to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's island in the latter's plane.	"Who is the woman in a viral photo with former President Bill Clinton? She's a photographer and co-founder of a New York-based modeling agency. But if you pose that question to adherents of a Qanon conspiracy theory, you'll probably get a different answer: She's an associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and recruits children to come to the billionaire's island.So how did this ordinary citizen get mixed up in the world of Q? It started with a single miscaptioned photograph that supposedly showed her on Epstein's private plane with Clinton:While this appears to be a genuine, unaltered photograph, the conspiracy theorists spreading it get several things wrong about what it shows. Mainly, the photograph wasn't taken on a plane owned by Epstein, who was charged with new sex crimes related to child-sex-trafficking for prostitution in the summer of 2019. Before we go any further, we should note that the Q conspiracy theory is built on speculation and wild assumptions. The woman has not been implicated in any legal proceedings related to Epstein, and she has not been charged with any crimes herself (Snopes is not identifying her to protect her privacy).Indeed, Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown, who was fundamental in uncovering Epstein's alleged sex-trafficking crimes, told us that she never come across the woman's name during her investigation into Epstein: ""I have never run across her name anywhere — and I checked with two people involved in the case for 12 years and they never heard of her. They suspect it’s BS internet conspiracy shit."" We also dug through dozens of Q posts, conspiracy primers, Qanon explainers, and 4chan and 8chan threads attempting to connect her to Clinton and Epstein, but we've yet to see any concrete evidence. Instead, we found invented explanations for out-of-context pictures and illogical leaps of faith being accepted as fact. The above-displayed picture has been online since 2006. It was originally shared with a caption saying it showed Clinton with a 19-year-old college student aboard billionaire venture capitalist Ron Burkle's private plane. It wasn't until several years later (circa 2017) that the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy community picked up this picture and started claiming that it showed a woman with Clinton aboard Epstein's plane (popularly dubbed the ""Lolita Express""). The fact that this photograph was circulating for more than a decade before it became attached to claims relating to Epstein should immediately raise red flags. Furthermore, photographs reportedly showing the inside of Epstein's plane don't appear to match with this viral picture. Here's a comparison of the viral Clinton photograph and a picture of Epstein's plane obtained by Radar Online:While we may be entering dot-connecting territory here, the design on the wall behind Clinton bears a resemblance to a photograph from Business Insider supposedly showing the interior of Canadian businessman Frank Giustra's plane. Giustra and Clinton, like Burkle and Clinton, were frequent travel partners:Angel Urena, Clinton's spokesperson, also denied that the viral image was taken aboard Epstein's plane: ""This photograph was not taken on Epstein’s airplane.""In addition to misidentifying the location of this photograph, Qanon believers also frequently share this photograph with the claim that the woman was underage at the time the photograph was taken. Again, this is based on pure speculation:When Gawker first shared this photograph in 2006, the organization claimed it showed a ""19-year-old college student."" This appears to be accurate. In 2009, The Cut identified the woman as a ""22-year-old"" in an article about her photography. This would make her approximately 19 in 2006 when the photograph was allegedly snapped. Clinton did fly on Epstein's plane a number of times. However, the above-displayed photograph does not document one of these trips. This photograph shows Clinton with a young woman aboard a plane more likely owned by either Burkle or Giustra. "	false

As Americans in various U.S. cities began demonstrating in April 2020 for the relaxation of social distancing and lockdown restrictions enacted to blunt the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, some protesters claimed that such restrictions were unconstitutional infringements of individual rights.One example of such claims was a social media post that asserted that citizens arrested for violating shutdown orders could ""win damages in court"" because ""the constitution supersedes any other law"":However, the basic premise of this message was wrong. Measures enacted to protect the public health, both during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 and in earlier health crises, have consistently been upheld against challenges in U.S. courts. For example, on May 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to lift a shutdown order issued by the governor of Pennsylvania requiring all non-life-sustaining businesses to temporarily close:The U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift Pennsylvania’s shutdown order, rejecting a request from businesses and a political campaign that said their constitutional rights were being violated.Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses closed in March to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The state has since begun easing the restrictions.The challengers included a golf course, laundromat, timber company, real-estate agent and political committee tied to a Republican state legislative candidate. They turned to the nation’s top court after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected their arguments.As well, in their survey of pandemic-related law, the American Bar Association (ABA) noted that:Under the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment and U.S. Supreme Court decisions over nearly 200 years, state governments have the primary authority to control the spread of dangerous diseases within their jurisdictions. The 10th Amendment, which gives states all powers not specifically given to the federal government, allows them the authority to take public health emergency actions, such as setting quarantines and business restrictions.With states adopting emergency measures, there are several broad public health tools that governors can invoke. They can, for example, order quarantines to separate and restrict the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. They can also direct that those who are sick with a quarantinable communicable disease be isolated from people who are not sick. And, as a growing number of governors have done in recent days, states can order residents to stay at home with exceptions for essential work, food or other needs. Curfews are another tool they can impose."	false
357	The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said that COVID-19 vaccines could have an adverse effect on female fertility.	"On May 31, 2023, Dr. Simone Gold, the founder of the anti-vaccine group America's Frontline Doctors, tweeted, ""BREAKING: The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has admitted that COVID-19 jab can have an adverse effect on female fertility.""BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh replied to the tweet, writing, ""The European Medicines Agency has said no such thing.""The European Medicines Agency has said no such thing— Shayan Sardarizadeh (@Shayan86) June 1, 2023Gold ended her tweet with a dramatic bit about, ""I fear we've only touched the surface,"" adding, ""The American people were lied to.""However, according to the data, the only people being misled here were the users who believed Gold's tweet.We previously reported that it's false to claim that COVID-19 vaccines threaten a person's fertility. To come to this conclusion, we referenced a number of authoritative sources. All of those sources were listed for readers to view at the end of the article.Gold's tweet contained no links or sourcing of any kind. One would assume that if an organization the size of the EMA (roughly 4,500 contributors) had made such an admission, this supposed news would be available on many websites online. It wasn't.It wasn't that the so-called admission was unavailable because the news media, both national and local, was trying to cover anything up, as a handful of social media users sometimes baselessly claim about these sorts of rumors. Rather, it's simply because it never happened.By email, a spokesperson for the EMA told us, in part, ""The claims circulating online alleging that EMA is advising pregnant women not to receive COVID-19 vaccines as these would 'cause infertility' are false,"" and added, ""These statements appear to be part of a deliberate disinformation campaign.""The organization also provided a full explanation of what they referred to as a ""misinterpretation"" of its product information:These allegations are a misinterpretation of the decision of EMA's safety committee (PRAC) to add heavy menstrual bleeding as a side effect of unknown frequency in the product information for the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines Comirnaty and Spikevax.The PRAC's recommendation was based on a review of all the available evidence, including cases reported during clinical trials, cases spontaneously reported in Eudravigilance and findings from the medical literature.A review of cases showed that heavy menstrual bleeding can occur after the administration of the first or second dose of the primary course and after administration of a booster.The Committee concluded that all the evidence together indicated that there is at least a reasonable possibility that heavy menstrual bleeding is causally associated with vaccination. The PRAC also noted that most cases assessed were short-lived. In the second part of the EMA's statement, the organization linked to highlights from an October 2022 meeting. They also cited documentation from several studies that reportedly ""did not find any sign of an increased risk of pregnancy complications, miscarriages, preterm births, or adverse effects in the unborn babies following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.""The Committee specified, in the communication issued at the time of the recommendation, that there is no evidence or plausible mechanism to suggest that menstrual changes experienced by some women following vaccination have any impact on fertility.With regard to the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on pregnancy in general, several studies involving around 65,000 pregnancies at different stages did not find any sign of an increased risk of pregnancy complications, miscarriages, preterm births or adverse effects in the unborn babies following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.In fact, COVID-19 vaccination may also be more beneficial to pregnant women as pregnancy has been associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19, particularly in the second and third trimesters.We previously reported that Gold has a history of amplifying false or unsupported claims about the COVID-19 pandemic. We also documented that she had participated in the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, an act that led to her serving a brief term in jail."	false

Mike Huckabee (and father of White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was targeted by Wolf during her set) posted before and after the 28 April 2018 event:The WHCD was supposed to celebrate the 1st Amendment. Instead they celebrated bullying, vulgarity, and hate. They got all dressed up so they would look nicer when they had a hired gun savagely attack their guests. Do they really wonder why America has no respect for them? Sad!Huckabee, as well as other conservatives and ""mainstream"" media members, have falsely accused Wolf of denigrating  Sanders' looks during her monologue at the event:﻿At one point Wolf said:I actually really like Sarah. I think she's very resourceful. She burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's lies. It's probably lies.Wolf responded to the outcry on her own Twitter account, saying:Why are you guys making this about Sarah's looks? I said she burns facts and uses the ash to create a *perfect* smoky eye. I complimented her eye makeup and her ingenuity of materials.Margaret Taley, president of the White House Correspondents Association, also backtracked regarding Wolf in a statement posted on 29 April saying that the comedian's monologue was ""not in the spirit"" of her group's mission."	true
3086	In April 2021, NASA discovered an “Earth-size, habitable planet.”	"In April 2021, NASA discovered an “Earth-sized, habitable planet” located 300 light-years from Earth.The so-named Kepler-1649c was found while scientists were looking through old observations from the agency’s Kepler mission, an initiative retired in 2018 that was aimed at discovering other terrestrial planets that may contain water. Previously, a computer algorithm misidentified the planet.Kepler-1649c is 1.06 times larger than Earth, and receives about three-quarters the amount of light, which suggests that the exoplanet may have a similar temperature to our planet. Exoplanets like Kepler-1649c orbit around other stars, whereas all of the planets in our solar system orbit around the Sun.While Kepler-1649c is outside of our solar system, it orbits within its star’s habitable zone, otherwise known as the “Goldilocks zone.” This means that the area where a rocky planet is orbiting is neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface. NASA/Ames Research Center/Daniel Rutter ""This intriguing, distant world gives us even greater hope that a second Earth lies among the stars, waiting to be found,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, in a news release. “The data gathered by missions like Kepler and our Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will continue to yield amazing discoveries as the science community refines its abilities to look for promising planets year after year.""Scientists note that there is still much that is unknown about Kepler-1649c, like the makeup of its atmosphere, which could affect its temperature. Though astrobiologists will need to know more information about the rocky planet in order to gauge if it is promising for potential life, it is especially interesting in the search for worlds beyond our own that may host life.""Out of all the mislabeled planets we've recovered, this one's particularly exciting – not just because it's in the habitable zone and Earth-size, but because of how it might interact with this neighboring planet,"" said Andrew Vanderburg, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin and first author on the a study describing the planet and published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. ""If we hadn't looked over the algorithm's work by hand, we would have missed it.""Just as Earth orbits the Sun, Kepler-1649c orbits a red dwarf star — but a year on the planet is equivalent to just 19.5 days on Earth. And because red dwarf stars are among the most common in the galaxy, planets like this could be more common than previously thought. Due to its unique composition, Kepler-1649c is one of the most comparable exoplanets to Earth in terms of size and energy that it receives from its star."	true

In August 2021, remarkable footage of a daring rescue re-emerged online, prompting interest from readers about its authenticity and origins. On Aug. 12, a post on the popular forum Reddit carried the title ""Firefighter snatches suicide jumper out of mid air"" and included the 20-second video, which although not graphic, shows an interrupted suicide attempt and thus might be upsetting to some readers:The footage was entirely authentic and really did show a firefighter, leaning out of a window while being supported by his colleague, catch a suicidal woman who had fallen or jumped from the floor above. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""True.""The incident took place in May 2018 in Riga, the capital city of the Baltic nation of Latvia. According to an official account posted by Valsts ugunsdzēsības un glābšanas dienests (the national Latvian State Fire and Rescue Service or SFRS), the firefighters responded to an emergency call from the apartment building in question, about a woman on the fourth floor who appeared to be contemplating suicide. Fearing that she might jump out of the window if they attempted to rescue her from inside her apartment, some of the firefighters set up on the floor below, while others went on the roof and attempted to lower mountaineering equipment in order to secure the woman. It's not entirely clear whether the woman ultimately jumped or fell from the fourth-floor window sill, and the SFRS statement noted that her fingers were observed to be ""slipping.""On the third floor, Tomas Jaunzems leaned out of the window while his colleague, Boriss Rutkovskis, braced Jaunzems' legs and helped stabilize him against the window ledge.

1499	"An image shows a text message reading ""Amazon won't let us leave"" that was sent by Larry Virden shortly before he died when a tornado hit a warehouse."	"A screenshot of a text message sent by an Amazon driver shortly before a tornado struck a warehouse in December 2021 stated that ""Amazon won't let us leave."" While this text message is real, we do not have enough information to confirm what measures Amazon did or did not take vis-a-vis workers' safety during the emergency. An OSHA investigation into the deadly incident is ongoing.Around 8:30 p.m. on Dec. 10, 2021, a tornado tore through Madison County, Illinois, before striking an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville where night workers were beginning their shift. The powerful tornado ripped off the building's roof, caused two of its 40-foot-high concrete walls to collapse, leaving six people dead in its wake. As news of this tragic incident circulated on social media, so did an image supposedly showing a text message thread between Larry Virden, one of the worker's who died, and his girlfriend, Cherie Jones. In one message, Virden writes, ""Amazon won't let us leave.""This appears to be a genuine image of a text message thread. While many people encountered this as a standalone image on social media, this image was first published in a local news broadcast from Fox 2 News after Jones provided it to the station. You can see the original news report below:Jones spoke more about this text message in an interview with the New York Post:“I got text messages from him. He always tells me when he is filling up the Amazon truck when he is getting ready to go back … I was like ‘OK, I love you.’ He’s like, ‘well Amazon won’t let me leave until after the storm blows over.'[...]“We heard the tornado didn’t touch down until 8:39 so he had 20 minutes to get home ... I messaged him and that was the last text message I got from him ... I told him where we live, it was only lightning at the time. After that, I got nothing from him.”Jones, however, didn't fault Amazon for his death. Instead, she said she viewed it as a ""what if"" situation, saying: ""what if they would have let him leave? He could have made it home.""It should also be noted that this text message was sent in the brief timespan (about 20 minutes) between the first tornado warning and the tornado striking the warehouse. As New York Times reporter Karen Weise noted, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidance is for people to ""seek shelter"" after these warnings.A spokesperson for Amazon told us that Amazon's leaders on the ground followed this OSHA guidance and worked to get people to take shelter after these warnings were issued. The spokesperson said: OSHA guidance clearly states to take shelter immediately when there’s a tornado warning. Our leaders on the ground followed their training and did just that, moving quickly to get people to take shelter immediately. That likely saved many lives from this storm. The site got tornado warnings between 8:06 and 8:16, and site leaders directed people on site to immediately take shelter. At 8:27, the tornado struck the building. Our team worked quickly to ensure employees and partners could get to the designated shelter in place area, and we want to thank them for everything they were able to do.In the wake of the deadly tornado, Amazon faced some criticism for not having an adequate safety plan in place. The BBC reported:Now, questions are being raised over whether adequate shelter was available, whether workers were advised to go there immediately, and whether the shifts should have gone ahead that evening at all, given the warnings of severe weather.The Edwardsville site received tornado warnings between 20:06 and 20:16 local time (01:06 and 01:16 GMT) before the tornado struck the building at 20:27, Amazon said in a statement when contacted by the BBC, with events ""happening incredibly fast"".The company said that the team worked ""incredibly quickly"" to ensure as many employees and partners could reach the ""shelter in place"" site.OHSA has opened an investigation into the collapse. OSHA spokesman Scott Allen told ABC News that the investigation will be complete within six months.“OSHA investigates all workplace fatalities, and we are supporting them,” an Amazon spokesperson said.Amazon, which is donating $1 million to the Edwardsville Community Foundation to help the community rebuild after the tornado, also said in a statement:""We’re deeply saddened by the news that members of our Amazon family passed away as a result of the storm in Edwardsville, IL. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their loved ones, and everyone impacted by the tornado. We also want to thank all the first responders for their ongoing efforts on scene. We’re continuing to provide support to our employees and partners in the area.”"	true

"An ad that said ""1 in 2 Mac users"" were ""unaware"" of a ""trick"" simply led to a software utility download with options for monthly or annual pricing.Since at least 2017, online advertisements have promised a special ""trick"" to help people with Mac computers. For example, one of the ads claimed: ""1 in 2 Mac Users Are Unaware of This Trick to Clean Their Mac."" Some of the ads appeared with this picture and text.The ad seemed to hint at a special, built-in, too-little-known function that Apple ships with its macOS updates.Perhaps it had something to do with an application in the Utilities folder, such as Disk Utility. Or maybe it was about something involving the Console or Terminal apps. The Utilities folder on a Mac can actually be quite useful.However, the ad did not lead to a special ""trick."" Instead, readers who clicked the ad were presented with a piece of software called MacKeeper.One of its primary functions appeared to be that it would clean up the file system on a Mac. It was priced with a choice of monthly or annual charges.We were unable to find any data on the MacKeeper website regarding whether or not ""1 in 2 Mac users"" were ""unaware"" of a ""trick"" to clean their Mac. However, we did find one page that claimed: ""1 in 2 of our users have had a virus before using MacKeeper.""In 2017, a person using the name DJDS-70 asked a question about the ads on Apple's official community discussion forums. They received an answer from a user named Yer_Man:DJDS-70: I saw this recent ad on the Newstream: 1 In 2 Mac Users Unaware Of This Computer Trick Mac owners urged to do this today...see why. It was posted by ScanGuard. Has anyone used it? Are they connected to Apple?Yer_Man: How on earth would they know what half of Mac users know or don't. Or half of Windows users? Or half of Yorkshire terrier owners. It's such a flatulent piece of copy that really, your common sense should tell you it's rubbish.The ad about the purported Mac ""trick"" might remind some readers of other ads about which we've reported.For example, a 2021 ad for the Capital One Shopping coupon code browser extension claimed that Amazon Prime membership prices had gone up.

2743	In August 2021, officials in New South Wales, Australia, announced they would be seizing tens of thousands of children from their parents and forcibly vaccinating them against COVID-19 in a stadium.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. 
In August 2021, online articles made alarming — and utterly false — claims about a supposed new COVID mitigation policy in Australia, namely ""seizing"" tens of thousands of children and forcibly vaccinating them in a stadium.For example, on Aug. 17, the Daily Expose website claimed in a headline that ""Minister for Health tells parents 24,000 children will be herded into stadium like cattle to get the experimental Covid-19 vaccine.""On the same day, the right-leaning Red State blog said Australia was ""cannon-balling right into the deep end of totalitarianism,"" and claimed that:Australia’s Minister For Health has announced that 24,000 students will be herded into a stadium in Sydney to be vaccinated by the government...In effect, children will be forcibly removed from the presence of their parents and injected by government agents....Imagine for one second the American military knocking on your door and escorting your children out to receive a treatment you may not feel confident about and they may not want at all.And on Aug. 18, the website National File published an article with the headline ""Australian Government To Seize 24,000 Children, Vaccinate Them Without Parents Present In Massive Stadium.""The story asserted that: ""The Australian government is going to seize 24,000 children from it’s [sic] citizens and place them in a stadium quarantine camp to be forcibly vaccinated,"" and added ""This is not embellishment, nor is it an exaggeration. This is actually happening.""Those claims constituted not only an embellishment and exaggeration, but were a fundamental misrepresentation of an announcement made by public health officials in the state of New South Wales, earlier in August 2021. What the National File described is not ""actually happening,"" and we are issuing a rating of ""False.""In August 2021, government officials in the state of New South Wales (NSW) announced that, in addition to adults of most age brackets, high school students aged between 16 and 18 would soon be invited to get their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at the Qudos Arena (also known as the Super Dome) in the state capital of Sydney. After being largely spared the very worst impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, cases and deaths had surged in Australia in 2021, and the summer had seen an outbreak of new cases in NSW, in particular, which is home to Sydney, the country's most populous city.On Aug. 5, the state Department of Health introduced a new ""stay-at-home"" order for eight local government areas (roughly equivalent to U.S. counties) with particularly concerning trends in COVID-related data.Mindful that high school students are expected to sit the Higher School Certificate (HSC) exams in October, officials in the state urged that cohort of students to get vaccinated in order to facilitate the smooth running of the exams, and prevent further outbreaks. Against that background, at the Aug. 6 daily COVID-19 briefing, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced that:From Monday next week [i.e. Aug. 9], at Qudos Bank Arena, HSC students in those eight local government areas will be invited to get the Pfizer jab, and most of those students are between the ages of 16 and 18 years of age. And we do encourage all students to make sure they come forward for that opportunity because, obviously, by the time everybody sits for the HSC exam, which is a requirement, we want every student from those eight local government areas to have been offered the vaccine and to have taken the vaccine.   An invitation to register for the vaccination drive would be emailed to students, and a telephone help line set up to respond to questions or concerns among students and parents, Berejiklian added. In order to reduce the number of people in the stadium at any given moment, only the students registered to be vaccinated would be permitted to enter. Said Berejiklian, ""We certainly don't want the virus to spread whilst people are going to get vaccinated.""In the same news conference, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard (whom Red State inaccurately described as ""Australia's Minister for Health"") characterized the week-long stadium vaccination program as a ""golden opportunity"" for high school students in the state, and sought to alleviate any potential concerns among parents, saying:I want to stress that, to the mums and dads, your children will be well looked after inside. When they arrive, they'll be literally ushered. We'll have nurses, we'll have some of the Youth Command, we'll have some of the young police from the various operations within police there, just to guide them through as to where they go.They'll be looked after every moment inside the stadium, and they'll be well cared for. So, mums and dads, feel secure. We've got about 24,000 students we're aiming to get through next week. The messages will come out this week, and the opportunity is there, but really you've got to take it. Grasp it with both hands. That portion of Hazzard's remarks was posted to Twitter without any context, forming the basis of the subsequent online articles. What neither the clip nor those articles made clear was that: the mass vaccination was voluntary, not forced; the ""children"" in question were aged 16-18, effectively young adults; they were invited to come to the stadium, not ""seized.""What was at play was a vaccination drive for young adults in order to facilitate the smooth running of important state exams in two months' time — not mass kidnapping and forced vaccination. There was also no need to have taken Berejiklian and Hazzard's word for it. By the time Daily Expose, National File, and Red State published their doom-laden articles, the stadium vaccination drive had already taken place.It began on Aug. 9, and cameras inside and outside the stadium captured the harrowing spectacle of teenagers texting while standing six feet apart, being attended to by staff after receiving their shots, and even being offered hand sanitizer on their way out: The operation did not go off without a hitch. The Guardian reported that some students were left frustrated by late changes to transport arrangements to the stadium, and Australian outlets reported that around 100 students were put on alert after a student who attended the stadium to be vaccinated on Aug. 10 later tested positive for COVID-19. "	false
5732	In September 2018, the University of Alabama football program ended its uniform contract with Nike, in response to Nike's endorsement deal with Colin Kaepernick.	"The controversy surrounding protests by National Football League players against racial injustice took another turn in September 2018, when Nike launched an endorsement deal with free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began symbolically protesting by declining to stand during the playing of the U.S. national anthem in 2016 while he was with the San Francisco 49ers.Nike’s announcement prompted calls for a boycott of the company, with some members of the public symbolically destroying their own Nike apparel as a gesture of opposition to the anthem protests and to Kaepernick (who had not been signed by any NFL team for two successive seasons).The flurry of media scrutiny and debate over Nike's deal with Kaepernick was also accompanied by misinformation, including false reports that the U.S. federal government had severed an $80 million contract with the company, that Nike had cancelled its deal with Kaepernick over ""anti-white attacks,"" and a viral hoax that falsely claimed that one protester had ended up in hospital after setting fire to his Nike shoes while he was wearing them.On 4 September, another piece of junk news did the rounds on social media.

Thus, as Hurricane Ian approached mainland Florida in late September 2022, some Twitter and Facebook users encountered photographs like this one in their timelines: The first thing to know about this tweet is that, as of Sept. 27 when it was posted, Hurricane Ian had not yet made landfall and there was no flooding reported in Tampa Bay, Florida.The second thing to know is that, as fakes go, this manipulated picture was poorly done and quite obvious.

2944	In April and May 2021, an actual gun store in Philadelphia sold sex toys molded to resemble the face of former U.S. President Donald Trump.	"In May 2021, social media users enthusiastically shared a Facebook post that appeared to come from a Philadelphia gun store selling sex toys shaped like the face of former U.S. President Donald Trump. (Note: This article contains photographs and descriptions of sex toys that some readers might find inappropriate.)The April 29 post from Mike Oxmall's Guns and Ammo contained a photograph of a table full of brightly colored dildos, each with a top molded in the shape of Trump's face. The Facebook post read:""We are now selling home made Trump 'toys' for that special lady in your life (NOT FOR MEN)...""The post was a hoax. The actual creator of the ""Trump dildos"" told Snopes she had no arrangement to sell them through ""Mike Oxmall's guns and ammo."" That Facebook page appeared to be no more than an online-only, pro-Trump parody page rather than a real, brick-and-mortar store located in Philadelphia. We are issuing a rating of ""False.""The photograph associated with the Facebook post was not original. It was actually first posted in 2017 by Jessica Hutcheson, an American artist, DJ, vocalist, and music producer based in Berlin, who created the Trump dildos and has posted photographs of them several times in the ensuing four years. Hutcheson, who goes by the monikers ""Hutch"" and ""Hutchtastic"" and has been strongly opposed to Trump and his presidency, told Snopes that she had ""nothing to do with"" the Facebook page in question, adding, ""They do not have any of my sculptures available for sale.""The claim that the gun store in question was selling Hutchtastic's Trump dildos was false. Furthermore, the entire Facebook page appears to be a pro-Trump parody and does not appear to relate to any real Philadelphia gun store. Firstly, the name of the ""store"" — ""Mike Oxmall's guns and ammo"" — appears to be no more than a crude play on words. (Read the full name out loud to yourself, a few times, if necessary.) Secondly, the page is categorized ""gun store"" and ""shooting/hunting range"" on Facebook, but also ""Satire/parody.""

2981	Attorney Lin Wood toured the White House in April 2021 looking for U.S. President Joe Biden, but found former President Donald Trump instead, while Biden remained missing and possibly dead.	"Wood posted images of himself on Telegram in which he appeared to be searching the White House for Biden, who is never shown. At one point, Wood vaguely (and falsely) implies Biden might be dead. However, the image he posted showing Trump was taken in March 2020, when Wood visited the White House while Trump was still president. Wood later suggested to Newsweek the posts were a joke.In late April 2021, QAnon-supporting conspiracy theorist and attorney Lin Wood shared a number of bizarre posts on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app.Wood, who has more than 840,000 followers on the app, claimed he went looking for U.S. President Joe Biden, who he dubbed “Joey ‘Bribes’ Bandito,” at the White House, and instead spotted former President Donald Trump working in the Oval Office.Screenshots of his posts were shared online:They showed Wood posing in a number of rooms that appeared to be in the White House. In one, he wrote, “Wow. I thought I might find Joey in the China room making an illegal deal for himself. But nope. No Joey.”In another, he posted a picture of a woman, and wrote, “Got a bit lonely waiting in this room for Joey so my Executive Assistant stopped by to keep me company. Still no Joey in the house. My incredibly efficient Executive Assistant agreed to wait here in case Joey shows. I left to search other areas of the house for him.”After 30 minutes of posting, Wood shared a picture of himself and Trump in the Oval Office, writing, “I was right. No Joey in the Oval Office. But I did run into our President of the United States. President Trump is hanging out and working in the office in which we re-elected him to serve in a historic landslide victory on November 3, 2020.” (It should go without saying by now, but for the record: Biden won that election.)Wood then shared a post from another popular Telegram account GhostEzra, which appeared to imply that Biden was dead. ""I was going to swing by Castle Rock Studio to search for Joey but GhostEzra suggested I head to this location. Is Ghost trying to tell me something???"" Wood wrote. He then shared a GhostEzra's post, a photo of a graveyard with the message, ""Hey Lin, check over here.""It is possible that these pictures were taken on a previous visit to the White House when Trump was in office. The picture of Wood and Trump in the Oval Office, which he also shared on Telegram, appears to have been taken on March 11, 2020, when Trump was still president. It can be seen here. While we cannot confirm, it is likely that all the other pictures were taken during that time as well, as Wood seems to be wearing the same suit and tie. Newsweek reached out to the attorney, and he responded, “I have a sense of humor. Do you?""Wood is running for the position of Republican Party chairman in South Carolina against incumbent Drew McKissick. When asked if it was appropriate for him to post such messages while running for this position, he told Newsweek, ""I am not aware of any rule that forbids a candidate for office from having a sense of humor while exercising his or her right of free speech.""Wood has also openly shown support for QAnon, a nebulous batch of online conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election, COVID-19 vaccines, and more. Wood's posts on Telegram appear to be a nod, joking or not, to one of those unfounded theories, which claims Trump won the election and Biden is not actually in the White House. We have debunked a similar rumor before. "	false
4174	"Starbucks has supported or promoted the campaign known by shorthand as ""defund the police."""	"In the summer of 2020, a new nationwide wave of protests against racial injustice and police brutality was accompanied by a rising campaign to substantially divert funding away from police forces, as well as to replace existing models of local law enforcement. The movement, referred to in shorthand by the somewhat imprecise phrase ""defund the police"" faced intense opposition from some right-leaning quarters, especially supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump.As a result, companies and organizations faced condemnation for their supposed association with the ""defund the police"" movement, and in July, readers asked Snopes to examine one such claim. A widely shared meme read:""Starbucks says Defund the Police. Let's defund Starbucks. Ask all friends and family not to be Starbucks patrons. Dunkin coffee is just as good!""We could find no evidence of any instance in which Starbucks, as a company, called for police forces to be defunded or abolished, promoted or supported the ""defund the police"" campaign, or indeed used the words ""defund the police"" (or similar phrases) in its public utterances or on its social media accounts. As a result, we are at a loss as to the origins of the false claim that ""Starbucks says defund the police.""The company has on several occasions articulated support for the Black Lives Matter movement and opposition to racial injustice, but that is clearly not the same as supporting the ""defund the police"" campaign. We found no evidence that Starbucks supports the ""defund the police"" campaign. By contrast, we found ample evidence of the company's partnering with various police forces as part of the ""Coffee with a Cop"" initiative, which encourages police officers and members of the public to meet in their local Starbucks café with the aim of creating understanding, rather than hostility, between law enforcement agencies and the communities they police. "	false
1451	Russian state television has been airing and translating clips from Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s show where he defends Putin.	"Curious about how Snopes' writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption? We've collected some posts that help explain how we do what we do. Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing.When Fox News host Tucker Carlson defended Russian President Vladimir Putin on his program, his viewers may not have imagined it would be used by Russian state television to help bolster that country's case for attacking Ukraine. But that is exactly what happened.Carlson spent a number of segments criticizing U.S. President Joe Biden and the Ukrainian government, and then often defending Putin, clips that have become fodder for Russian television. On Feb. 17, 2022, for example, he said:And of course, they're promoting war, not to maintain the democracy that is Ukraine. Ukraine is not a democracy. It has never been a democracy in its history and it's not now. It's a client state of the Biden administration. It's a place in which opposition media and opposition political candidates are completely shut down by the government. Is not a democracy at all. And it's insulting they would suggest otherwise.That same clip was aired on Russia 1, a state television channel, with a translation.ORT or Channel 1 Russia, broadcast a clip of Carlson in which he showed U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal telling MSNBC about the need to supply missiles to Ukraine. The clip cuts to Carlson laughing and saying, “So that guy, who lied about his own war service, is pretty excited at the thought of Ukrainians fighting and dying in the streets.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1KBN4ou4cY&t=2564s
 
Even RT, another Russian-backed television channel, has been using Carlson’s perceived defense of Putin from his Feb. 23 show. RT published an article about him on its website, titled, “Tucker Carlson wonders why U.S. elites hate Putin.” The article begins with: “Tucker Carlson, a popular Fox News host who often questions Washington’s rationale for confronting Russia, has doubled down on his ‘why should I care’ position regarding Ukraine.”In the segment, Carlson said:Since the day that Donald Trump became president, Democrats in Washington have told you it's your patriotic duty to hate Vladimir Putin. It's not a suggestion. It's a mandate. Anything less than hatred for Putin is treason.Many Americans have obeyed this directive. They now dutifully hate Vladimir Putin. Maybe you're one of them. Hating Putin has become the central purpose of America's foreign policy. It's the main thing that we talk about. Entire cable channels are now devoted to it. Very soon, that hatred of Vladimir Putin could bring the United States into a conflict in Eastern Europe.Before that happens, it might be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious: What is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs?These are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is no. Vladimir Putin didn't do any of that. So why does permanent Washington hate him so much?RT compared Carlson’s approach to that of more liberal MSNBC: “Earlier this week, pro-Democratic Party channel MSNBC ran a segment that lamented Carlson’s impact on US foreign policy through his ability to whip up isolationist sentiments in the voter base – 'the way he can change the tide for otherwise-fascistic leaders,' as host Alex Wagner put it, referring to Putin and to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.” The article also pointed out that MSNBC “is currently experiencing a drop in viewer numbers after its star host, Rachel Maddow, went on an extended break [and] prefers to invite interviewees such as Republican arch-hawk John Bolton to comment on Ukraine.”RT reportedly aired the same clip of Carlson stating the above, with Russian subtitles:On Feb. 23, the Russian Television and Radio channel aired the same clip of Carlson, where he questions American’s hatred of Putin:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpWehZQfoxY&t=1485s
 
But Carlson has been popular on Russian state television even before the invasion. A Jan. 30, 2022, CNN segment looked into Carlson’s presence on Russian channels:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvMiuhbh5Fs
 
Since his recent clips aired on Russian television, Carlson has toned down his rhetoric, saying on Feb. 24:Vladimir Putin started this war so whatever the context of the decision that he made, he did it. He fired the first shots. He is to blame for what we're seeing tonight in Ukraine. The question is, once we've established that and it's obvious, how should the United States respond to what he has done?So, within minutes of the outbreak of the war last night, the usual liars on television began leveraging this tragedy for partisan political gain. If you ever watch the aftermath of the school shooting, you're familiar with how they behave. It's contemptible, but we're going to ignore it tonight because there is too much else going on that actually matters and the main thing that matters in any crisis is deciding what's most important, creating a hierarchy of concern.
[...]
Again, what Russia has done is awful, but we can still make it worse.Russian state media is also reportedly airing clips of former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling Putin ""very shrewd,” ""very capable,"" and adding, ""I have enormous respect for him.""On Mar. 16, 2022, videos from Russian media that we posted here on Feb. 25, are no longer available. However, MSNBC also reported on Carlson's coverage in Russian media on March 14, 2022, saying he was being promoted ""as much as possible"":Given the number of available clips of Russian channels sharing Carlson’s show, we therefore rate this claim as “True.”Sources:Carlson, Tucker. “Americans Have Been Trained to Hate Putin, and Will Suffer Because of It.” Fox News, 23 Feb. 2022, https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-hate-putin-americans-suffer.

150	A pound of muscle weighs the same as a pound of fat.	"A simple math problem garnered over 4,000 upvotes on Reddit this week and sparked hundreds of comments, many of which were arguing about the answer. Last week, a Reddit user posted a screenshot to r/facepalm, a subreddit dedicated to the things that exasperate and astound us, of a Healthline article. The r/facepalm forum is often use to poke fun at hubris or ignorance; for example, the tourists defacing the ancient ruins of the Roman coliseum, or the kid who attempts a backflip and lands face-down on the floor. In this case, however, the ""facepalm"" is arguably the post itself. According to science
by u/Linux_B in facepalmIt appears as if the poster sought to mock Healthline's claim, which is that a pound of fat and a pound of muscle are equal. However, it's true: a pound of muscle and a pound of fat weigh the same thing. They both weigh 1 pound. The confusion often comes from a question of volume as opposed to weight. Muscle is more dense (i.e., has more mass per unit of volume) than fat. This is why, for example, an athlete building muscle may see a decrease in their waistline but a plateau on the scale. Muscle takes up less space than fat, but space is not an issue when weighing an object — its mass is. Weight, which is a measurement of the force of gravity acting on a given mass, is not affected by volume, just the number of atoms in a given substance or object.As several commenters pointed out, it's highly evocative of ""What's Heavier?"", a viral segment from Scottish sketch comedy series, ""Limmy's Show.""For those still confused, it also provides a good visual explanation of the way the math works. "	true
2873	Former President Donald Trump had an exact replica of the Oval Office built at Mar-A-Lago.	"The desk and chair in Trump's Mar-A-Lago office are similar to the ones he used in the White House, but Trump did not build an exact replica of the Oval Office at his Florida club. In May 2021, a rumor started circulating on social media that former U.S. President Donald Trump had built an exact replica of his White House Oval Office at his Florida club Mar-A-Lago. This rumor was largely based on a meme that also claimed Trump was spending his days watching old videos of his presidential rallies as well as footage from the violent aftermath of the ""Stop the Steal"" event in Washington, D.C., that led to his second impeachment:  The claims made in this meme are fabrications. While we don't know Trump's day-to-day schedule, there have been no credible reports that he has been obsessively watching old campaign rallies or footage of the Capitol riot.The claim that Trump had a replica Oval Office constructed in Mar-A-Lago is also unfounded. This rumor stems from a photograph posted by former White House aide Stephen Miller in April 2021. When outlets such as Express penned articles about this photograph, they used misleading titles like ""Donald Trump clones White House with his replica Oval Office at Florida home."" While there are certainly some similarities between Trump's offices at Mar-A-Lago and the White House, the former president did not construct a replica Oval Office in Florida. Here's the photograph from Miller (left) and a photograph of Trump in the Oval Office (right):     Trump did bring some personal items from the Oval Office down to Mar-A-Lago. One piece of office décor found in both offices can can be seen on the right of Miller's photograph: A set of family photos. On the left of Miller's image, you can also see Trump's collection of ""Challenge Coins,"" a commemorative coin that is traditionally given to people to prove membership in a certain organization or branch of the military, that were displayed in both offices. While Trump has displayed various items in both offices, this hardly qualifies as ""constructing"" a duplicate or replica Oval Office. As you can see in the images above, Trump did not have an oval-shaped room constructed at Mar-A-Lago to replicate the specific dimensions of the Oval Office. He did not decorate the office with the same curtains, flags, carpets, or lights. He simply had some of the items he displayed in the Oval Office transferred to his new office in Mar-A-Lago.   The only items that come close to ""duplicating"" the Oval Office are Trump's desk and chair. The chair is reportedly the same chair he used in the Oval Office. Trump did not bring the Resolute Desk with him to Oval Office, but he did purchase what appears to be a ""Telluride Wood Executive Desk,"" according to Politico, that somewhat resembles the historic Oval Office desk.  Politico writes:DESK: While Trump couldn’t take the 141-year old Resolute Desk from the Oval Office, he now has a similar-looking desk that appears to be the Telluride Wood Executive Desk from “Hooker Furniture.” The desk currently retails for $3,600 but is currently out of stock until late next month.CHAIR: Trump used the same chair in the Oval Office, which he brought down from New York, according to a former White House official."	false
271	Three men died entombed 40 feet below the ocean after surviving 16 days in the hull of USS West Virginia following the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor	"The Monkey Bar in Honolulu, Hawaii — so named for the live monkeys that once resided behind the bar — was a popular watering hole on the island of Oahu from its inception in 1939. It is now closed, but sailors stationed at Pearl Harbor on liberty from their naval duties were frequent guests at the bar's dark brown counter.One such man was Fireman First Class Clifford Olds, a 20-year-old North Dakotan assigned to the USS West Virginia. While on liberty from the ship on Dec. 6, 1941, Olds visited the bar and had his picture taken alongside two friends. It was the last photograph to be taken of the young man. Clifford Olds is pictured at far right along with fellow sailors Jack Miller (left) and Frank Kosa (middle). Kosa was killed in February 1944 aboard the USS De Haven in the Pacific. USS West VirginiaThe next day, Olds found himself on duty during the worst military attack to date on American soil. In the chaotic aftermath of the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Olds and two other men would find themselves entombed alive in the hull of the naval vessel settled in the muddy seafloor of the harbor 40 feet below the surface. It would take them 16 days to die. Photograph taken from a Japanese plane during the torpedo attack on ships moored on both sides of Ford Island in Pearl Harbor. Naval History and Heritage Command Photograph/Public DomainReports initially indicate that the families of the three sailors wouldn't learn of the fate of the men until decades later when, in the early 1990s, former crewmembers began sharing stories of their experiences with the press. In 1995, Honolulu Advertiser reporter Eric Gregory described the catastrophic event in greater detail and The Seattle Times later republished the article on the anniversary of the attack.And in the decades since, various iterations of the event have been shared to social media.As the U.S. honored the 80th anniversary of Pearl Harbor in 2021, Snopes dug through the archives to confirm the conditions that led to the deaths of the three sailors. But first, a look at the events that led up to the disastrous attack.Nicknamed the ""Wee-Vee,"" the USS West Virginia measured more than 600 feet long and could hold over 1,400 sailors. First commissioned in November 1921, the battleship was moved to Pearl Harbor in 1940 after nearly two decades serving in the U.S. Fleet in Australia and New Zealand, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command.At the time of the Dec. 7 attack, the ship was positioned outboard, or to the outside of, the USS Tennessee as part of a seven-ship lineup on ""Battleship Row,"" when it was hit by two bombs from overhead and by at least six torpedoes (some accounts say seven) underwater, ultimately killing 106 of its crew members, notes the National Park Service.Following impact, officers aboard the Wee-Vee called what is known as a ""set condition Zed"" — a naval technique that requires closing of all hatch compartments and counter-flooding a portion of the ship so that she won't capsize but will sink upright. The decision allowed hundreds to escape but sealed the fate the three live men trapped in the hull.For 30 hours, the ship burned slowly as it sank and the morning following the attack, crew members and naval personnel reported hearing a tapping sound originating from the forward hull of the vessel.""When it was quiet you could hear it...bang, bang, then stop. Then bang, bang, pause. At first, I thought it was a loose piece of rigging slapping against the hull. Then I realized men were making that sound -- taking turns making noise,"" said bugler Dick Fiske in a piece written by Roger Hare. The sinking of USS West Virginia. Public DomainSailors recount the following days when men dreaded guard duty that put them within earshot of the sunken battleship and the ""desperate — almost tireless — cry for help."" For more than two weeks the banging continued, but crews were unable to get to those making the sound. Drilling a hole in the boat might have caused a ""blowout"" from the pressure of the seafloor, while oil spilled along the surface of the ocean could have easily sparked an explosion.It wasn't until months later, when crews were able to pump out water to partially float and dry-dock the boat that the bodies of the three men were found in storeroom A-111, alongside flashlight batteries, manhole access to a supply of fresh water, and eaten emergency rations.A now-lost calendar had red X's marking the days between Dec. 7 and Dec. 23.Olds was reportedly entombed alongside 18-year-old Ronald Endicott and Louis ""Buddy"" Costin, 21. We cross-checked a casualty list posted by the National Park Service, the government agency that oversees management of Pearl Harbor today, and found that all three men were indeed listed as deceased in the attack. A look through gravesite databases also confirmed that Ronald Endicott of Washington state and Buddy Costin of Indiana were killed in the attack and subsequently buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl crater in Honolulu. Cliff Olds' body was returned to his home state of North Dakota.In April 1943, the USS West Virginia steamed to the West Coast for final repairs and emerged again in July 1944 as a modernized ship that would play a key role in many battles and ultimately be present at Tokyo Bay during the Japanese surrender. Decommissioned in 1957, the Wee-Vee was sold for scrapping in 1959.In all, the attack on Pearl Harbor lasted less than two hours but killed 2,403 U.S. personnel, including 68 civilians, and destroyed or damaged 19 Navy ships, according to The National WWII Museum. "	true

4156	President Trump gave a talk during the COVID-19 pandemic in which he remonstrated about showers and dishwashers not functioning properly due to low-flow standards.

On July 16, 2020, as the U.S. recorded its single highest number of COVID-19 cases since the coronavirus health crisis began, U.S. President Donald Trump spoke at an event held on the South Lawn of the White House, ostensibly on the subject of ""Rolling Back Regulations to Help All Americans."" During his talk, according to a meme, Trump allegedly tackled the subject of energy-efficiency standards which have supposedly resulted in home appliances that do not function properly due to requirements aimed at conserving the amount of water and power they consume:This was an accurate reproduction of a portion of Trump's talk, according to a White House transcript of the event:We’re bringing back consumer choice in home appliances so that you can buy washers and dryers, showerheads and faucets. So showerheads — you take a shower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair — I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect.Dishwashers — you didn’t have any water, so you — the people that do the dishes — you press it, and it goes again, and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you’ll end up using less water. So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water. And in many places — in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don’t know what to do with it. It’s called “rain.” They don’t have a problem.This was far from the first time the president had riffed on poorly functioning appliances. In December 2019, as Trump spoke in the Roosevelt Room of the White House amidst an impeachment inquiry, he digressed into railing about toilets and other bathroom fixtures that allegedly frustrate their users due to the use of low-flow technology. CNN reported:The President claimed Americans are flushing their toilets ""10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once"" and argued that they are having difficulty with washing their hands in what appeared to be a tangent about low-flow sinks and toilets.""We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on -- and in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don't get any water,"" the President said during a roundtable with small business leaders about deregulatory actions.""You turn on the faucet and you don't get any water. They take a shower and water comes dripping out. Just dripping out, very quietly dripping out,"" the President continued, lowering his voice as he spoke about the drips. ""People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once.""It wasn't entirely clear what he was talking about, but it appeared to have to do with bathroom fixtures with low-flow appliances. He said the Environmental Protection Agency was looking into the issue on his suggestion.""They end up using more water. So (the) EPA is looking at that very strongly at my suggestion,"" Trump said, though he did not give details on what suggestions, if any, he made.NPR quoted the Pacific Institute, a non-profit research institute with a focus on global and regional freshwater issues, as asserting that Trump's statements did not comport with reality:Peter Gleick with the Pacific Institute in Oakland considers this all to be Trumpian nostalgia for a time when showers were strong, toilets used 4 gallons a flush and lightbulbs burned your hands when you touched them.Gleick said these newer household items are part of an ""efficiency revolution,"" doing the same tasks with less and halting the upward trajectory of water and energy consumption in America. And, yes, a dishwasher cycle takes longer, and incandescent bulbs are cheaper to buy upfront.But in the long run, ""They're much more expensive, because they use a huge amount of energy, which we pay for over time and they burn out 20 times faster,"" Gleick said.Based on the way Trump talks about efficient lightbulbs, it seems his complaint is with compact fluorescent bulbs, which were the only low-energy bulbs widely available 10 years ago. But today, store shelves are full of LED bulbs with warmer-looking light and even longer life spans. Gleick suspects Trump's toilet complaints are outdated as well, because low-flow toilet technology has come a long way in recent years.""Some people got bad toilets, but that was 15 and 20 years ago,"" Gleick said. ""And now the new toilets not only use a tiny fraction of the water the old toilets used to use, but the truth is they flush better — and if you have a bad toilet that doesn't flush, well, that's because you have a bad toilet.""A video of the portion of the speech reproduced in the above meme can be viewed here:"	true

Attached to Musk's post was a screenshot of Google search results for ""npr federal funding essential,"" displaying the headline ""Public Radio Finances"" on NPR's website with the in-question quotation underneath it.NPR literally said ""Federal funding is essential to public radio"" on their own website (now taken down).What hypocrites! pic.twitter.com/kYAXW0zpyl— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 12, 2023Similar claims surfaced on platforms like Facebook and Reddit. They spread in tandem with breaking news that NPR decided to stop using Twitter in light of the ""state-affiliated media"" label, which Twitter later changed to ""government-funded media."" (As of April 21, 2023, Twitter had removed all such labels.)NPR said that categorization was false considering the small amount of federal funding that fuels its operations — less than 1% of its annual operating budget, according to the outlet — and undermined its credibility, The Associated Press reported. (Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), which Twitter labeled ""government-funded media"" around the same time, also stopped tweeting from its main account.)The underlying claim about federal funding and NPR's website was true. At the time of publication, a section of the website said, ""Federal funding is essential to public radio's service to the American public and its continuation is critical for both stations and program producers, including NPR."" (The word ""essential"" is bolded on NPR's website.)Musk's assertion that the nonprofit news organization had supposedly ""taken down"" the in-question statement was false. The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine showed the statement was displayed on that date, as well as before and after that date. There was no evidence that it had ever been removed, even temporarily.The statement appeared near the bottom of NPR's ""Public Radio Finances"" webpage — which reports information on its revenue, sponsorships, contributions, expenses, etc. — under a section titled ""Member Station Revenues"" and the subhead ""Public Radio and Federal Funding."" It read:Federal funding is essential to public radio's service to the American public and its continuation is critical for both stations and program producers, including NPR.Public radio stations receive annual grants directly from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) that make up an important part of a diverse revenue mix that includes listener support, corporate sponsorship and grants. Stations, in turn, draw on this mix of public and privately sourced revenue to pay NPR and other public radio producers for their programming.These station programming fees comprise a significant portion of NPR's largest source of revenue. The loss of federal funding would undermine the stations' ability to pay NPR for programming, thereby weakening the institution.Elimination of federal funding would result in fewer programs, less journalism—especially local journalism—and eventually the loss of public radio stations, particularly in rural and economically distressed communities.Stations receive support from many sources, including:On average, less than 1% of NPR's annual operating budget comes in the form of grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments.In other words, NPR's webpage states that less than 1% of its annual operating budget comes from federal agencies and departments, as well as the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). Grants from the CPB go directly to member stations, which use the money to help pay NPR for its programming.According to the webpage, federal funding helps public radio stations pay fees to NPR. It states that without the funding, there would be ""fewer programs, less journalism — especially local journalism — and eventually the loss of public radio stations, particularly in rural and economically distressed communities.""In a different section of the webpage about the outlet's revenue, NPR says its two largest revenue sources are ""corporate sponsorships and fees paid by NPR Member organizations to support a suite of programs, tools, and services."" For instance,  corporate sponsorships comprised about 39% of the organization's revenue between fiscal years 2018 to 2022, while ""core and other programming fees"" made up 31%, according to NPR."	true
1368	"In 2022, ice cream company Klondike discontinued its ""choco taco"" product."	"In 2022, a rumor started to circulate on social media that Klondike, the ice cream company, had discontinued its taco-shaped, waffle-cone product called ""choco tacos.""This is, unfortunately, true. The Choco Taco has been discontinued. When we reached out to Unilever, the company that owns Klondike, a spokesperson confirmed to us that the Choco Taco, which was invented in Philadelphia in 1984, had been discontinued. The spokesperson wrote:The Klondike Choco Taco has unfortunately been discontinued in both 1ct and 4ct pack sizes. Over the past 2 years, we have experienced an unprecedented spike in demand across our portfolio and have had to make very tough decisions to ensure availability of our full portfolio nationwide. A necessary but unfortunate part of this process is that we sometimes must discontinue products, even a beloved item like Choco Taco. We know this may be very disappointing, but we hope you'll try one of our other great products, including Klondike Cones, Shakes, Sandwiches, and of course, our signature Bar available nationwide.When this rumor first started circulating, Klondike had yet to make any statements about the discontinuation of the Choco Taco. When we originally addressed the rumor, we labeled it ""False,"" in part, because we didn't want to believe that it was true. Additionally, Klondike had dispelled these rumors just a few weeks earlier, writing that while the 4-packs had been discontinued, the single-serving products were still on offer:Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. In 2016, The Eater took a deep dive into the Choco Taco's storied history. While the piece is worth reading in its entirety, we'll leave you with this undoubtedly embellished quote from Alen Drazen about the company's inspiration for inventing the Choco Taco: ""I was on an expedition in Mexico and got separated from my party. It was hot. I hadn't had anything to drink. And then I saw a mirage. An ice cream taco, rising out of the distance. That's how I got the idea."" "	true
1840	The FBI announced an inquiry into Russian ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.	"On 1 November 2016, the liberal blog Occupy Democrats posted a story headlined, ""FBI Just Announced It’s Looking Into the Trump Campaign’s Ties to Russia"" that made it appear as if a criminal case against Donald Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, were imminent:It’s official. NBC is now reporting that Donald Trump’s campaign management has fallen under the scrutiny of an FBI inquiry, which is sure to blossom into a formal criminal investigation centered on Trump’s disgraced ex-manager Paul Manafort’s stewardship of the Republican campaign and his close ties to Ukraine. When he departed, Manafort was facing felony charges, and now the FBI’s suspicions have been confirmed by the evidence.New York Times found Ukrainian documents which outlined $12.7 million in previously unreported payments from a Ukrainian political party to Manafort, precipitating his departure from the campaign.In August 2016, the New York Times published a report that a secret ledger had been unearthed in Ukraine showing $12.7 million in payments designated from Viktor Yanukovych’s pro-Russian political party to Manafort between 2007 and 2012. When the story was published, anti-corruption officials in Ukraine told the paper that they had not yet determined whether Manafort had actually received the money.The Occupy Democrats story was based on a later 1 November 2016 NBC report:The FBI has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort's foreign business connections, law enforcement and intelligence sources told NBC News.Word of the inquiry, which has not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation, comes just days after FBI Director James Comey's disclosure that his agency is examining a new batch of emails connected to an aide to Hillary Clinton.While an unnamed source apparently spoke to NBC, the FBI at that time had not not announced an inquiry into Manafort's activities — the Bureau, generally, does not officially confirm whether or not they are investigating a matter, and they responded to our inquiry by saying just that. Similarly, they gave no formal statement to NBC.But on 20 March 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey broke from that practice to announce the FBI was in fact investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. During a public hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey said:The FBI, as part of our counterintelligence effort, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 president election.Less than two months later, President Trump fired Comey, prompting Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein, who had been given oversight of the Russia investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself amid questions about his own communications with Russians, hired Special Counsel Robert Mueller."	true
753	Two photographs taken in different centuries of Fort Denison in Sydney Harbor show that the sea level in that area has not changed in over 100 years, thus disproving climate change.	"Two photographs taken of Fort Denison in Sydney Harbor, Australia — one a black-and-white photo from the 19th century and the other a modern, full-color picture — are circulating with the claim that they show the sea level in that area has not changed in over a century, thus (supposedly) disproving climate change.We found by conducting a reverse image search that iterations of the same meme have been shared online since at least 2018. In July 2022, it was shared to Twitter, falsely claiming that ""unprecedented climate change"" had caused ""sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years.""To draw such a conclusion from a photo comparison is erroneous. As we have previously reported, these types of oversimplified memes are meant to discredit science without taking into account a number of environmental factors that may influence sea level in the area, including, as some social media users pointed out, the very simple fact that ocean tides fluctuate over predictable timeframesCarly Shabot with California Sea Grant told Snopes that one ""cannot compare photos without more information as they may have been taken at different tides or times.""""Sea levels can appear higher or lower depending on the time, day and season each photo was taken,"" added Shabot.Because the meme did not provide further information about when the photographs were captured, as well as during which tide, using a comparison of the two pictures to make an argument is not credible.Both images appear to feature Fort Denison, a heritage-listed part of Sydney Harbor National Park located in the eastern Australian city. The black-and-white image shows the fort as it stood in the 1880s, though some accounts note that the photo was taken in 1885, according to the National Archives of Australia. Fort Denison circa 1885. National Archives of Australia/Public DomainTo say that the sea level in the Sydney, Australia region have not risen since the 19th-century is false. While sea level rise in that specific area is less than the global average, NOAA reports that the relative sea level trend is .75 millimeters each year, or .029 inches. It's an admittedly small level and one that may not be detectable by the naked eye, but it's a rise nonetheless. Sea level trends of Fort Denison in Sydney Harbor, Australia.

2779	In June 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden said white Republican men were more dangerous than the Islamic State group, or words to that effect.	"In June 2021, Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed that President Joe Biden had warned the American public ""white Republican men"" are ""more dangerous than ISIS.""Carlson made the claim during the June 1 episode of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" He was criticizing proposals to segregate unvaccinated individuals at certain public events, as well as well-founded claims, promulgated on CNN, that white, Republican men had the highest levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. After playing a series of clips of CNN, Carlson resumed his monologue, as follows:Yeah, you're not surprised. It's always the same people, those white Republican men. The very ones that, just today, Joe Biden warned us are more dangerous than Isis ...A much shorter clip posted to Twitter showed only this part of the monologue, without the lead-up outlined above:Carlson's claim was false. Earlier that day, Biden spoke at a commemoration of the centennial of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, in which white mobs looted and burned down dozens of blocks in the affluent Black neighborhood of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Towards the end of his address, Biden said:And finally, we must address what remains the stain on the soul of America. What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism, with a through line that exists today, still. Just close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville, four years ago, on television. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK, coming out of those fields at night, with lighted torches, the veins bulging as they were screaming. Remember? Just close your eyes and picture what it was.Well, Mother Fletcher said when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January the 9th [Jan. 6], it broke her heart. A mob of violent white extremists. Thugs. She said it reminded her of what happened here in Greenwood 100 years ago. Look around at the various hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Jewish Americans. Hate that never goes away. Hate only hides.Jesse [Jackson], I think I mentioned this to you — I thought after you guys pushed through, with Dr. King, the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act, I thought we moved. What I didn't realize — I thought we had made enormous progress and I was so proud to be a little part of it — but you know what, Rev.? I didn't realize hate's never defeated, it only hides. It hides. And, given a little bit of oxygen, just a little bit of oxygen, by its leaders, it comes out of there from under the rock like it was happening again, as if it never went away.So folks, we can't — we must not give hate a safe harbor. As I said it my address to the joint session of Congress, according to the intelligence community, terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today. Not Isis, not Al Qaeda — white supremacists. That's not me, that's the intelligence community under both Trump and under my administration. [Emphasis is added].Carlson's description of what Biden said was inaccurate and misleading in several ways.Firstly, Biden never mentioned Republicans or the Republican party, nor did he use terms that are synonymous with the Republican party, or even conservatism more broadly. It was Carlson, not Biden, who equated ""white supremacist terrorism"" with ""white Republican men."" Secondly, Biden never mentioned ""men"" or ""male"" or gender in any way. Carlson seemed to see ""white Republican men"" somehow encoded in the phrase ""terrorism from white supremacy."""	false
1421	Entertainer Ed McMahon was a spokesperson for Publishers Clearing House.	"There's no evidence that McMahon ever worked for Publishers Clearing House. He was, however, a spokesperson for American Family Publishers. In old television commercials for American Family Publishers, the word ""Publishers"" appeared much smaller than ""American Family,"" perhaps because the company knew that so many American households had confused the two brands, believing that McMahon worked for the competition.Entertainer Ed McMahon was never a spokesperson for the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes. However, there appears to be a large number of Americans who believe that he was. This is an example of a false memory, known as the ""Mandela Effect.""It's called the ""Mandela Effect"" because of the false memory of so many people who believed Nelson Mandela died in prison in the 1980s. In reality, he died in 2013.The false memory that McMahon worked for Publishers Clearing House likely existed in the minds of many Americans for one or a combination of several reasons.Some readers might fondly remember Publishers Clearing House television commercials from past decades where sweepstakes winners were notified at their doorsteps by PCH Prize Patrol that they had won large cash prizes, sometimes with a big check. However, McMahon never appeared in the ads. Here's an example of one such commercial:McMahon appeared in television commercials for a company similar to Publishers Clearing House that was named American Family Publishers. The word ""Publishers"" appeared smaller than ""American Family,"" perhaps because the company knew that some American households had confused the two brands.While working as a spokesperson for American Family Publishers, a drawing of McMahon's face appeared on envelopes that were sent to American households. However, his face never appeared on Publishers Clearing House envelopes, because again, he never worked for the company. McMahon hinted at the competition (Publishers Clearing House) and his face on the envelopes in this old television commercial:In 1994, McMahon and fellow spokesperson Dick Clark participated in a television commercial for American Family Publishers. This was the only footage we found that showed the pair with what appeared to be a real winner. A woman in the ad said that McMahon showed up to her door to present the check. We were unable to find any footage that documented the celebratory moment:A photograph shared online appears to show McMahon holding a check that reads, ""Big Win.""Thanks to help from several readers, we confirmed that this was simply a guest appearance by McMahon on the 2004 reality television series titled, ""$25 Million Dollar Hoax.""In an unknown year, McMahon took part in a commercial for Neighborhood Watch. The idea for the humorous ad was to have McMahon visit people's doorsteps to sign them up for the program. The script called for the actors who played homeowners to pretend as if they believed they had won a cash prize, simply because McMahon was standing in front of their houses:McMahon appeared in several television sitcoms and on late night talk shows where he would show up at doorsteps (albeit with nondescript checks).According to screenshots gathered by a YouTube user, McMahon appeared at front doors with big checks on ""Roseanne,"" ""Who's the Boss?,"" ""The Nanny,"" ""Boy Meets World,"" and several other shows. The checks sometimes said ""Jackpot"" or ""Sweepstakes"" and did not show a company name:On an episode of ""The Golden Girls,"" actor Betty White once mentioned McMahon working for Publishers Clearing House, even though he never had any association with the company:We also found three more references. A picture showed that McMahon once handed out a small check as a joke on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno."" Former late night talk show host Johnny Carson once visited ""The Late Show with David Letterman,"" where he delivered a big (and apparently fake) check with the Publishers Clearing House name, apologizing in jest that McMahon couldn't be there to present it. There was also a photograph that showed him preparing to present a big check to winners of the MegaBingo Championship in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2003.After this story was published, we were made aware of an hourlong YouTube video where McMahon had been interviewed by comedian Tom Green. At the 41:50 mark below, Green asked McMahon if he did, in fact, ""walk up to people's doorsteps"" to deliver prizes. McMahon said yes and told Green he handed out $110 million in prizes, sometimes with Clark alongside.This interview appeared to confirm that McMahon did, in fact, deliver big checks to people's front doors. It's unclear if any video of these surprise visits still exists."	false
519	A photograph accurately showed passengers aboard Aloha Airlines 243 flight after its roof ripped off mid-flight on April 28, 1988.	"Over the course of history, airplane crashes have been relatively rare. But some — like Aloha Airlines 243 flight on April 28, 1988 — are so shocking that they deserve revisiting.A 2023 Reddit post showed a photograph of passengers aboard that plane, sitting in their seats, after its roof apparently tore loose and peeled off mid-flight. A flight attendant was killed and more than 60 people suffered injuries, The Washington Post reported at the time.The Reddit post claimed, ""On April 28, 1988, the roof of an Aloha Airlines jet ripped off at 24,000 feet, but the plane still managed to land safely."" This photograph was authentic and published by the Honolulu Star Bulletin, a Hawaiian newspaper now known as the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. It was taken by Bob Nichols, one of the flight's passengers. In addition to other photos of the roofless plane, black-and-white and colorized versions of the in-question image were available on the Star-Advertiser's website, as of this writing, with the caption: This is the Boeing 737 that lost the forward upper half of its fuselage in-flight. Capt. Robert Schornstheimer and First officer Mimi Tompkins were able to maintain control of the aircraft and land it in Maui. Only one life was lost when a flight attendant was blown from the aircraft. Aloha Airlines crew members help shaken passengers from the wrecked airplane after it landed at Kahului Airport on Maui.The Star Advertiser published the same photograph in the following YouTube video (around :59), which posted in April 2018 to commemorate 30 years since the incident:A 1988 Washington Post article about the flight described how the roof tore off mid-flight:A huge section of the roof of an Aloha Airlines jet, which safely made an emergency landing on a Hawaiian island Thursday, tore loose and peeled off over the Pacific after an apparent structural failure weakened its fuselage, accident investigators said yesterday.A flight attendant, Clarabelle Lansing of Honolulu, was sucked through the opening, and 61 of the 94 others aboard were injured -- one critically -- as the pilots maneuvered the plane down from 24,000 feet and landed with an engine on fire at Kahului Airport on Maui Thursday afternoon.""There was a big bang when it happened and everybody looked up and we were looking at blue sky,"" said Bill Fink, a passenger who was flying home to Honolulu from Hilo.The twin-engine, 110-seat Boeing 737-200 jet was halfway into a 40-minute flight when it suddenly lost cabin pressure and a 20-foot by 11-foot chunk of the fuselage, exposing passengers in the 96-foot cabin to open sky.According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the roof likely tore off after Aloha Airlines' maintenance program failed ""to detect the presence of significant disbonding and fatigue damage of the fuselage skin lap splice,"" which refers to the panels that encase an aircraft's machinery.The FAA also stated that a passenger noticed a crack in the airplane fuselage during boarding, but she did not tell the crew before takeoff.Additionally, the FAA shared archival footage of the airplane after its emergency landing taken from various angles. About halfway through the video, passengers can be seen seated in the aircraft with the roof no longer above them:"	true
3756	"The song “A Spoonful of Sugar,” written for the Disney movie “Mary Poppins,"" was inspired by the experience of one of the songwriters' children receiving an oral polio vaccine with a sugar cube."	"A familiar song from everyone’s childhood has an interesting backstory, which carries particular resonance as the COVID-19 vaccine was administered for the first time in late 2020. On Dec. 1, 2020, Jeffrey Sherman — the son and nephew of Robert and Richard Sherman, the songwriting duo responsible for the music of classics like “Mary Poppins,” “The Jungle Book,” “The Aristocats,” and more — shared how the song “A Spoonful of Sugar” from “Mary Poppins” came about.Sherman posted the following story on Facebook describing the inspiration behind the lyrics, “A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,” and a number of Snopes readers asked us to verify if this account was true. We learned it was.Robert Sherman himself described this moment in his autobiography “Moose: Chapters From My Life.” He and his brother were coming up with songs for Julie Andrews, the actor who would go on to embody Mary Poppins, but she was not a fan of their favorite number, “The Eyes of Love,” which she thought was “too sentimental.” So the Sherman brothers were stumped and spent weeks working on a rewrite. Robert described one evening when he came home:Joyce and my three children, Laurie, Tracy and Jeff (Robbie had not yet been born) greeted me as I arrived. I asked the kids how their days had been. Joyce informed me:
“Jody got the Salk Vaccine today.”
I looked down at my five year old son and asked him: “Did it hurt?”
He replied: “No. They just put it on a cube of sugar and we swallowed it down.”
And that was it! I realized at the moment that I had the spark of a winning song. I couldn’t sleep all night. The lyric mulled around in my mind. The next day, at work, I showed up half an hour earlier than usual so that I could pop the idea on my brother. As he walked into our shared office, I must have spooked him a little. I don’t think he expected me to be so plosive.
I said: “Dick! A Spoonful of Sugar Helps the Medicine Go Down!”The Salk vaccine for polio was developed in the early 1950s by Jonas Salk, and was first administered through needle injections. According to McGill University’s Office for Science and Society, the oral polio vaccine received by Sherman’s son was developed by Albert Sabin and introduced commercially in 1961, and it largely replaced the original injectable form of the vaccine.But sugar also helped reduce the pain from injectable vaccines. British pediatrician Paul Heaton found that a few drops of sucrose solution put on infants’ tongues before an injection was capable of blocking the pain felt in their arms or bottoms from an injection."	true
3546	"Pfizer vaccine ""page 132"" warns not to have unprotected sex for 28 days after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine because ""genetic manipulation"" may cause birth defects."

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. 
In late December 2020, social media users shared a copy-and-pasted meme that falsely claimed pharmaceutical company Pfizer recommended that members of the public receiving its COVID-19 vaccine should use birth control because ""genetic manipulation"" resulting from the vaccine could lead to birth defects.Here's an example of the meme:The accompanying link did not lead to safety instructions accompanying the Pfizer vaccine, which has been approved by the U.S. government for emergency use, as the meme insinuates. Instead, the link led to a publicly available document outlining the methods used in a crucial Pfizer/BioNTech clinical trial for the vaccine that is currently in use. The trial is ongoing.Further, page 132 of that study does not state that unprotected sex should be avoided due to risk of birth defects resulting from ""genetic manipulation."" There is no mention of birth defects or genetic manipulation resulting from the vaccine on page 132.The Pfizer document instead recommended that study participants take measures to avoid pregnancy for 28 days after the last vaccine dose during the trial, a time period ""which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate reproductive safety risk"" of the vaccine. This is a broad recommendation for all clinical trials of new pharmaceuticals with unknown reproductive risks. The broad guidance for such clinical trials can be seen outlined by the National Institutes of Health.This boilerplate precaution for clinical trials isn't evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine currently in use in the U.S. harms pregnant women or fetuses.The U.S. government has so far approved for emergency use two mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 developed by both Pfizer and Moderna. The vaccines do have side effects like fatigue, fever and headache, as well as localized pain.The claim that the Pfizer vaccine, which is given in two doses, results in birth defects from ""genetic manipulation"" is likely influenced by viral, false claims that COVID-19 vaccines alter or damage human DNA. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ""Women who are trying to become pregnant do not need to avoid pregnancy after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.""As the CDC noted, ""experts believe that mRNA vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or the fetus. However, the potential risks of mRNA vaccines to the pregnant person and the fetus are unknown because these vaccines have not been studied in pregnant people."" If pregnant people are among high-risk groups currently being vaccinated, like medical personnel, they can still receive the vaccine, per the CDC."	false
486	In May 2023, the outline of a giant penis was created in a lawn in Bath, England, where residents' parties and gatherings were scheduled to be held to mark the coronation of King Charles.	"While the giant penis appeared in the grass of a historic lawn in Bath, England, it was unclear who did it or whether it was related to the planned coronation parties for King Charles on May 6, 2023.In what some may describe as a major dick move ahead of the May 6, 2023, coronation of King Charles, someone created a large outline of a giant phallus at a park in Bath, England. According to reports, the erect penis outline was 30-feet-long and seemingly appeared overnight, noticed by local residents on May 4. This was indeed a real outline of a giant penis cut into the lawn of the historic Royal Crescent row of houses, considered to be an important example of Georgian-era architecture. However, officials apparently don't know who did it, or why, though a number of parties and picnics had been planned in the area to mark the coronation of King Charles. Aerial visuals of the penis appeared on SomersetLive, a local news outlet. The giant penis caused quite a stir, leaving residents ""shocked,"" according to SomersetLive. Other residents shared photographs of it from different angles, some describing it as ""very funny.""Historian and resident Kirsten Elliott Swift said in her tweets, ""@Bathlive thinks [the phallus is] mown but it looks more like carefully applied herbicide.""

2125	Ivana Trump was buried at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.	Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s first wife, Ivana Trump, was laid to rest at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, based on media reports and photographs taken of the site. New York Post reporters visited the golf club and photographed Ivana Trump’s grave. Their report included a number of shots from different angles, including one revealing a wooded area near the site. A source told the New York Post that Ivana was buried not too far from the club house. According to the report, she was buried in a place that was not visible to golfers as they tee off for a round of golf. The small section of the club where she was buried is below the backside of the first tee. A number of memes consisting of edited versions of those photographs went viral in late July 2022, with one in particular getting tens of thousands of likes and comments on Instagram. The image — posted by Instagram account homegrownterrorists  — showed a golf cart rolling past what appeared to be Ivana Trump's gravesite.It's clear that this photograph is fake when it's compared to the pictures published in the New York Post article. The gravesite has been inserted into a wider shot of a golf cart on a golf course fairway. Unlike the Post's photographs, the manipulated image doesn’t show a wooded area immediately adjacent to the grave. A separate rumor speculates that Trump used the burial site for tax break purposes. Indeed, the New Jersey tax code does exempt cemetery land from all taxes, rates, and assessments. Potentially, her grave could save the property from paying a significant sum in a state with high tax rates. According to the code, a cemetery company is exempt from paying real property taxes, income taxes, sales and use taxes, business taxes, and inheritance taxes; cemetery trust funds are also exempt from taxes. Trump has expressed his desire to be buried at the New Jersey golf course for years. His company even described it as his “favorite property” in a 2014 filing with the state. A 2017 Washington Post report revealed how he had been trying to convince local authorities to let him build cemeteries at the golf course since 2007. After numerous attempts, two of his plans were approved around 2017, but construction for them had not begun. The 2017 report said that the Trump Organization still needed to apply for state approval to make the land a public cemetery. However, Ivana Trump is the first known family member to be buried at the Bedminster golf club. Brooke Harrington, a sociology professor at Dartmouth and tax researcher, pointed out that the tax code has no stipulation for a minimum number of human remains needed for the tax breaks to apply. Documents published by ProPublica show that the Trump Family Trust had sought to designate a property in nearby Hackettstown, New Jersey, as a non-profit cemetery company. However, this was not the first time Trump had been accused of trying to reduce his taxes on the property by varying its use. A 2016 Wall Street Journal report found that the golf club benefited from a farmland tax break because part of the land was designated for agricultural purposes — specifically for hay production and a small herd of goats. The Huffington Post reported in 2019 that he had saved around $88,000 that year. New Jersey laws state “a landowner must have no less than five acres of farmland actively devoted to an agricultural or horticultural use for the two years immediately preceding the tax year being applied for and meet specific minimum gross income requirements based on the productivity of the land.”A representative for the Trump Organization told Fortune magazine that the links being drawn between Ivana Trump's gravesite and tax laws were “truly evil.” 	true
1358	Cell phone calls from particular phone numbers cause brain hemorrhage and death.	"Claims of potentially fatal phone calls have been circulating via email and internet rumor since 2007, and they persist despite the lack of hard evidence about where these supposed deaths occurred. Adding to the fear-mongering are the area codes these phone calls supposedly originate from, which correspond to Middle Eastern countries (most notably Iran and Afghanistan).One such example read: Hi Colleagues,I don’t know how true this is but just take precaution. Please don’t attend to any calls from the following numbers:* 7888308001 ** 9316048121 ** 9876266211 ** 9888854137 ** 9876715587 *These numbers come in red colors. U may get brain hemorrhage due to high frequency. 27 persons died just receiving the calls watch the DD news to confirm. Please inform all your relatives and friends soon it's urgent. Another example the Snopes newsroom came across stated: Hi All,Its very important news for all of you. Do not pick up calls Under given numbers.9888308001 , 9316048121 91+, 9876266211, 9888854137, 9876715587These numbers will come in red color, if the calls comes up from these numbers. Its with very high wave length, and frequency. If a call is received on mobile from these numbers, it creates a very high frequency and it causes brain ham range.It's not a joke rather, its TRUE. 27 persons died just on receiving calls from these numbers. Watch Aaj Tak (NEWS), DD News and IBN 7.Forward this message to all u'r friends and colleagues, and relativesWhile it might seem that this canard combines an assumed fear of people of Middle Eastern descent with rumors that cell phones can somehow cause tissue damage, the fiction's origins are actually in the Middle East itself. In fact, this warning appears to have started in Pakistan in 2007, spreading first to Afghanistan and then to other countries.It is simply not possible for cell phones to transmit at frequencies that would cause immediate fatalities. This legend depends on a misunderstanding of how frequency waves and resonance work. Sound waves and vibrations can be destructive (consider sound waves breaking glass or the destruction of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge), but circumstances have to be very precise for this to happen. (The University of Salford explains how to replicate the glass shattering effect with sound waves). One key element is volume: without enough volume, sound waves simply do not vibrate glass hard enough to cause destruction. Since cell phones have a limited volume range, this affects their ability to cause damage to the brain. Cell phone frequencies range from 698 to 2155 MhZ, not even enough to pop popcorn.There is still no solid evidence cell phones can even produce wavelengths that cause damage to the human body, most notably in the form of cancer-causing radiation. The National Cancer Institute's web page on cell phones states that ""Research studies have not shown a consistent link between cell phone use and cancer. A large international study (Interphone) published in 2010 found that, overall, cell phone users have no increased risk for two of the most common types of brain tumor.""The final bit of this legend that is questionable is the ""red number"" display. With the exception of user customization on some smart phones, incoming calls are always displayed in black — callers cannot change settings on someone else's phone simply by dialing their number.Despite the complete implausibility, these rumors continue to circulate, seen more recently in Kenya in late 2010. Part of this persistence was fueled by a June 2004 hoax letter, purportedly from a Nokia executive to his staff, claiming that the rumors are true and that ""energy surges into [the user's] body, resulting in both coronary heart failure and brain hemorrhage.""In 2005, Nokia issued a statement refuting the contents of the letter. A spokesman for Nokia said: ""Like many other claims circulating on the internet, this is a hoax.""""The letter has absolutely nothing to do with Nokia. We regret any inconvenience caused to our customers by this work of fiction.""The bogus letter also claims all other mobile phone manufacturers are affected by the same problem. It says it is an inherent fault in the system design and cannot be resolved.Addressed To All Staff and stamped 'confidential', the letter has been made to look like it has been leaked from within the company — but the word haemorrhaging is spelt incorrectly.The final paragraph warns staff if they speak to anyone about the letter they will be sacked.<!-- -->"	false
24	"""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg reacted after film actor Tom Selleck chided her in his praise for country singer Jason Aldean."	"On Aug. 12, 2023, a purported celebrity news YouTube channel known as Just In (@JustInCeleb) published a new video that claimed ""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg said the words, ""I don't deserve this!,"" after film actor Tom Selleck made remarks about what she said in regard to country singer Jason Aldean's music video, ""Try That in a Small Town."" The title read, ""3 MINUTES AGO: Whoopi Goldberg BEGS FOR MERCY As Tom Selleck DESTROYS Her.""By Aug. 14, the original video and several reaction videos had been viewed for a total of more than 1 million times, a number that was likely to grow much larger in the days that followed.In other words, this was no small-time rumor.Here's the truth: This video's central claim about Goldberg reacting to something that Selleck said about her was false. It was made up, apparently for the purpose of bringing in views and comments from online users who place blind trust in headlines and thumbnail images so long as they validate their preconceived viewpoints about the world of entertainment and politics.Selleck did not make any public remarks about Goldberg in regard to Aldean, nor was there any evidence that he had voiced support for the country singer. Further, Goldberg never reacted to Selleck by saying, ""I don't deserve this!,"" despite the quote being featured in the video's thumbnail image.As we previously reported, the rumor that Selleck had voiced support for Aldean originated from a website that publishes satirical content. It's called The Dunning-Kruger Times and is part of the America's Last Line of Defense network of websites.In other words, the thousands of internet commenters who believed the primary claim to be true had fallen for a video that presented satire, albeit with an added falsehood.That falsehood: Goldberg's face and name didn't appear in the satirical article about Selleck and Aldean. She was an addition to the story by the video's creators.Also, early in the video, the AI-generated narrator's voice mentioned that Goldberg was involved in a lawsuit with Aldean. However, as we reported, while Goldberg truly had talked about Aldean's music video on ""The View,"" the part about there purportedly being a lawsuit had originated in yet another satirical article on the Times' website.According to a Facebook page that bears the Just In (@JustInCeleb) name and logo and appeared to be affiliated with the YouTube channel, its online presence is managed by 11 page managers located in Indonesia. A past attempt to contact the people who run the channel was unsuccessful."	false
5276	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau transferred control of the Canadian border to the United Nations.	"On 10 December 2018, Canadian blogger Spencer Fernando reported that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had turned the country's border security over to the international United Nations organization:
The Trudeau government has betrayed the Canadian People by signing the UN Global Compact on Migration, dealing a severe blow to Canada’s sovereignty.The Compact will be used by the Trudeau government to crackdown on the press (at least the ones he isn’t bailing out), by trying to silence any speech that is critical of ‘migration.’Additionally, the Compact begins a transfer of authority from national governments, to the centralized authority of the United Nations, turning migration (AKA control of national borders), into something dominated by supranational institutions.It’s a clear step by the global elites and the Trudeau government to wipe out Canada’s borders, and push our nation further in the direction of being a ‘post-national state,’ where Citizenship, borders, and democracy are stripped of all meaning.The Trudeau-led Canadian government did sign on to the U.N. Global Compact for Migration on 10 December 2018, along with more than 160 other countries.  But that agreement doesn't usurp the control of national borders and hand it over to the U.N. The agreement states the opposite and makes several references to respecting sovereignty and each nation's control of their own international boundaries. Item 7 of the preamble, for example, states:This Global Compact presents a non-legally binding, cooperative framework that builds on the commitments agreed upon by Member States in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. It fosters international cooperation among all relevant actors on migration, acknowledging that no State can address migration alone, and upholds the sovereignty of States and their obligations under international law.And under the ""Unity of Purpose"" section, the agreement again affirms sovereignty of each state:National sovereignty: The Global Compact reaffirms the sovereign right of States to determine their national migration policy and their prerogative to govern migration within their jurisdiction, in conformity with international law. Within their sovereign jurisdiction, States may distinguish between regular and irregular migration status, including as they determine their legislative and policy measures for the implementation of the Global Compact, taking into account different national realities, policies, priorities and requirements for entry, residence and work, in accordance with international law.Global News similarly noted of the agreement that:
[T]he pact sets out a “non-legally binding, cooperative framework,” meaning it’s more of a declaration rather than a legally binding treaty.Indeed, the pact’s preamble states explicitly that it “reaffirms the sovereign right of states to determine their national migration policy,” meaning governments will not sign away their rights to design their migration policies by signing onto the pact — contrary to [Conservative leader Andrew] Scheer’s criticisms.Indeed, Scheer’s characterization of the pact’s legal authority was dismissed as “factually incorrect” by a former Conservative immigration minister.Chris Alexander, who served as immigration minister under Stephen Harper, tweeted that the pact “is a political declaration, not a legally binding treaty.”
The popularity of the blog post was likely the result of its similarities to the popular conspiracy theory that the United Nations is both trying to undermine the sovereignty of nation states and that it is a driving force behind global migration.As RationalWiki points out, conspiracy theories about the New World Order, a vague idea that a nefarious secret cabal is plotting to undermine the United States, often incorporate claims about the U.N. erasing national borders:Current conspiracy theories about the UN usually portray it as the heart of an alleged ""New World Order"" (NWO), or at least implicate it as a major player in said Order. The UN effectively acts as a Rorschach test for political cranks to project their paranoia onto. Some more recent conspiratorial notions include:"	false

The meme was described as ""a brief history of capitalists complaining that nobody wants to work for starvation wages.""The same meme also appeared on Twitter just four days later. Both posts received thousands of shares and retweets.While the Facebook post and tweet displayed the information in a meme, the originator of all of this was a thread by Paul Fairie, who is known on Twitter as @paulisci:The meme and thread supposedly showed 14 clippings from articles that were printed between the years of 1894 and 2022, all of which appeared to display people expressing the general opinion that ""nobody wants to work anymore."" Some of the articles showed the exact words from the top of the meme and thread, while others displayed a variation of the belief. The idea of the meme and thread was to show that, in each of the 14 years displayed, the person who either said or wrote the opinion appeared to believe it to be a novel thought.With the help of Newspapers.com, we located all of the old articles and applied the above ""True"" rating as an indication that all of the clippings were real.The most recent article that was labeled in the meme and thread as being published in 2022 came from Forbes. The piece began, ""According to a new survey released by TinyPulse, 1 in 5 executive leaders agree with this statement: 'No one wants to work.' These same leaders cite a 'lack of response to job postings' and 'poor quality candidates' when describing why it’s hard to hire right now.""In 2014, the Germantown News near Memphis, Tennessee, printed an article that was written by a pastor. Part of the article read as follows: ""What has happened to the work ethic in America? Nobody wants to work anymore. It has not always been that way."" The pastor then talked about, ""When I first started to work as a teenager,"" which kind of read as a variation of, ""When I was your age...""The clipping from 2006 came from a question that was sent by a reader to the Ventura County Star in California. It read, ""I can't believe the bad luck I have had in trying to find someone to do some needed home improvements. It almost seems like nobody wants to work anymore and when they do work, they take no pride in what they do. How does one find a dependable worker?""In 1999, the Clearwater Times in Florida printed a story about Cecil and Henry Lopez, two brothers who had decided to call it quits after managing a shoe repair shop for 53 years:Their Service Shoe Repair shop, at 649 Cleveland St., is for sale. Cecil, 78, and Henry, 73, would take about $80,000 for the business, which has been in the same leased space for 45 years. But they don't seem extremely optimistic about finding a buyer. ""Nobody wants to work anymore,' Cecil said. 'They all want to work in front of a computer and make lots of money.""The Miami Herald published an article in 1981 about an 89-year-old man named Sammy James. James had worked for decades as a crate nailer and said his fast moves earned him the nickname, ""The Nailer.""According to the story, James once said, ""Farming is my hobby now. But, these rocks — I hired two boys to clear the rocks off this land last week. But they just fooled around. They didn't want to work. Nobody wants to work anymore.""In 1979, Ohio's News-Journal reported a story about a man living in the New Orleans suburbs named Jack Diamond. At the time, Diamond had decided to permanently close his dry cleaning business after managing it for 40 years. He placed a sign in his window that said, ""Closing June 5 due to taxes, labor, and robberies.""The News-Journal's article included the following mention of the phrase from the meme and thread:[James] faults the welfare system as one factor in the labor shortage.""About three months ago a woman came in here and said she wanted a job. I asked her if she knew anything about the business. She said no. So I told her I could start her at $3 an hour.""""She laughed in my face and said, 'Mister, I can clear $106 a week on welfare.

The government puts everybody on welfare when they ought to be working.""The Atlanta Constitution, now known as The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, once published an article in 1969 about a new local television series:Atlanta viewers will have an opportunity to listen to the poor talk about the problems of low-income citizens and their communities on a new 10 week series produced by WQXI-TV in cooperation with Economic Opportunity Atlanta, Inc.…Last Sunday, the first of the programs dealt with ""how it feels to be poor"" and the upcoming Sunday segment is called ""Nobody Wants to Work Anymore.""The Alabama newspaper The Evergreen Courant once printed what appeared to be a letter from a reader that said, ""I heard somebody say the other day that everybody was getting too darned lazy and nobody wants to work anymore. That's the truth if I ever heard it.""In 1940, The Wisconsin State Journal published that Gov. Julius Heil was speaking about recent legislation when he said, ""The trouble is everybody is on relief or a pension — nobody wants to work anymore."" The article ended there without any further elaboration.In 1937, The Gazette and Daily newspaper in York, Pennsylvania printed an article with the headline, ""Orchardists Complain of Shortage of Labor."" The opening paragraph read as follows:Faced with a shortage of labor when unemployment is widespread, peach orchardists in York and Adams counties are complaining that, 'Nobody wants to work anymore.' There is work, it is reported, for 15 to 25 peach pickers in every orchard in the two counties, but only two to five pickers are at work because of the unavailability of labor.In 1922, The Mulberry News in Kansas, once printed a letter from a reader that contained the phrase from the meme and thread:What is the cause of unemployment and hard times? The manufacturer and business men say it is because nobody wants to work anymore unless they can be paid enough wages to work half of the time and loaf half of the time. The working man says that hard times are caused by the determined stand the employers have made to beat down wages. Now why is it these things exist during a Republican administration?The Binghamton Press in New York published the following headline in 1916: ""Prices to Be High for Thanksgiving Dinner.""

1917	"Bill Nye said that gender is determined ""by your chromosomes"" during an episode of ""Bill Nye the Science Guy."""	"In April 2017, as a debate over the role of science in the United States continued in the wake of the international March for Science, an image appeared purportedly showing a still from an old episode of Bill Nye the Science Guy along with a caption stating ""Gender is determined by your chromosomes"":This meme gained popularity shortly after the debut of Nye's new show, Bill Nye Saves the World, which featured an episode entitled ""The Sexual Spectrum.""Here's how Nye opened the episode in question — not by saying that ""gender is determined by your chromosomes,"" but by discussing that the genetic basis of sex determination through chromosomes is more complicated than usually presented:These are human chromosomes. They contain all the genes you need to make a human person. This one is called an X chromosome and this one down there, that's a Y chromosome. They are sex chromosomes. Females usually have two Xs and males usually have an X and a Y. But it turns out, about 1 in every 400 pregnancies have a different number of sex chromosomes. Some people only have one sex chromosome, some people have 3, 4 or even 5. For me, I usually feel like I have a lot. But using science, we know that sex and every aspect of human sexuality, well, it's a little complicated ...The world is wonderfully diverse. As scientists we use the scientific method to try and understand that diversity. That is what is happening with the study of human sex and sexuality. Right now, biologists, sociologists, anthropologists, they all are trying to figure this out. And they are finding out that human sexuality is on a spectrum.  Conservative outlets criticized Nye for contributing to ""transgender insanity,"" and social media users shared memes insinuating that Nye's science had been irrevocably tainted by liberal politics:"	false
2730	"Medical practitioners can enter the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code ""W17.9"" to quickly register another fall from a milk crate."	In August 2021, the internet was swept up in another viral challenge as a plethora of videos went viral that showed people attempting to walk across increasingly higher levels of milk crates. As nearly all of these videos ended with someone suffering a violent fall, many people were prone to believe the rumor that hospitals had created a new International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code to specifically address milk crate falls.  This rumor was widely spread in a viral TikTok video: There is not a new ICD-10 code to specifically address milk crate falls. This rumor started as a joke on Twitter by a meme account:The ICD is a diagnostic tool maintained by the World Health Organization. WHO writes:ICD is the foundation for the identification of health trends and statistics globally, and the international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. It is the diagnostic classification standard for all clinical and research purposes. ICD defines the universe of diseases, disorders, injuries and other related health conditions, listed in a comprehensive, hierarchical fashion that allows for:We searched WHO's database of ICD codes but could not find anything specifically related to a fall from a milk crate. We also searched the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) version of this database (ICD-10-CM) but again found no such code. The W17 prefix is used for falls in this database and can be used to signify everything from a fall from a grocery cart (W17.82XA) to a fall down a hill (W17.81XA), but there is no code for falling off a milk crate.It should also be noted that while there have been a number of editions of this database (the 10 in ICD-10 stands for the 10th edition), these codes are not updated in real time to address viral trend on TikTok. The World Health Organization did add a series of emergency codes in 2020 to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Falling off milk crates has not yet reached emergency status. While there is no ICD code yet for this specific brand of falls, that doesn't mean that doctors aren't concerned about this new challenge. The Guardian reported:As videos of people falling painfully go viral on social media and rack up millions of views, doctors across the US are coming out to warn people of the dangerous injuries that can occur.“It’s perhaps even worse than falling from a ladder,” said Shawn Anthony, an orthopedic surgeon at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, to the Washington Post. “It’s very difficult to brace yourself from the falls I’ve seen in these videos. They’re putting their joints at an even higher risk for injury,” he added.We reached out to the WHO and CDC for more details and we will update this article accordingly. Sources:Classification of Diseases (ICD). https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases.

4615	"Additional entries to a ""You Had a Hunch the News System Was Rigged?"" list document several familial relationships between prominent U.S. political figures."	"Back in 2016, we analyzed a widely-circulated list titled ""You Had a Hunch the News System Was Rigged?"", which purportedly documented that multiple prominent network news media executives had familial ties to the Obama administration.In the years since then, references to the Obama administration have been dropped from the footer of the list, and several new names of prominent and supposedly related political figures have been added to the beginning of the list. Our previous article covered the original entries on the list, while this update tackles those that have subsequently been added (shown in bold below):YES, CALIF GOV. GAVIN NEWSOME IS NANCY PELOSI'S NEPHEW.
AND YES, ADAM SHIFF'S SISTER IS MARRIED TO GEORGE SOROS' SON.
AND YES, JOHN KERRY'S DAUGHTER IS MARRIED TO A MULLAH'S SON In IRAN
And Yes, Hillary's daughter Chelsea IS married to George Soros' nephew.IF YOU HAD A HUNCH THE NEWS SYSTEM WAS SOMEWHAT RIGGED AND YOU COULDN'T PUT YOUR FINGER ON IT, THIS MIGHT HELP YOU SOLVE THE PUZZLE.ABC News executive producer Ian CAMERON is married to SUSAN RICE, Obama's former National Security Adviser.CBS President DAVID RHODES is the brother of BEN RHODES, Obama's Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications.ABC News correspondent CLAIRE SHIPMAN is married to former Obama White House Press Secretary JAY CARNEY.ABC News and Univision reporter MATTHEW JAFFE is married to KATIE HOGAN, Obama's former Deputy Press Secretary.ABC President BEN SHERWOOD is the brother of Obama's former Special Adviser Elizabeth Sherwood.CNN President VIRGINIA MOSELEY is married to former Hillary Clinton's Deputy Secretary TOM NIDES.All of the newly added entries to this list are false statements, as detailed below:False. In 1963, Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro married Paul Frank Pelosi and began carving out a career for herself in politics. Since 1987, Nancy Pelosi has represented various districts in California in the U.S. House of Representatives and currently holds the position of Speaker of the House. Gavin Christopher Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco and lieutenant governor of California, was elected governor of California in 2018.At one time, Pelosi and Newsom had something of a familial relationship via marriage, but it was extremely tangential and ceased to exist several decades ago. The gist of this relationship was that from 1956 to 1977, Nancy Pelosi's husband's brother, Ron Pelosi, was married to Gavin Newsom's aunt, Barbara Newsom, making Nancy Pelosi's brother-in-law an uncle-by-marriage of Gavin Newsom. However, that tenuous familial connection stretches the meaning of the word ""nephew"" to the breaking point, and as noted, it terminated when Ron Pelosi divorced and remarried over four decades ago.False.In 2018 Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking minority member of the House Intelligence Committee, authored a rebuttal to Rep. Devin Nunes's memo alleging that the FBI had improperly obtained a warrant to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during an investigation into claims of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A rumor was then floated on internet forums attempting to discredit Schiff by declaring that his sister was married to the son of international financier and philanthropist George Soros.As we pointed out in a separate article, although a woman named Melissa Robin Schiff did indeed marry Robert Soros, the son of George Soros, in 1992, she is not related to Adam Schiff (who has no sister).False. As we also noted in another separate article, Vanessa Bradford Kerry, the daughter of former Secretary of State John Kerry from his previous marriage to writer Julia Stimson Thorne (from whom he was divorced in 1988), married Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. However, Brian Nahed is not the ""son of a mullah in Iran."" Brian Nahed's parents were born in Iran, but they permanently left that country to immigrate to the U.S. over forty years ago and now live in Los Angeles, where Brian's father (like Brian himself) works as a physician. Brian Nahed was not born in Iran, he has never held Iranian citizenship, he has never worked or lived in Iran, and has never even been to Iran. He's a natural-born U.S. citizen from New York who has lived, attended school, and worked in the United States his whole life.False.In 2010 Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, married American investor Marc Mezvinsky, whom actor Scott Baio later supposedly ""discovered"" was the nephew of George Soros. However, in yet another article, we detailed that Mezvinsky's parents are former Rep. Edward Mezvinsky of Iowa and former Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinksy of Pennsylvania, neither of whom is the child of a sibling of George Soros. Soros has two nephews, Peter Soros and Jeffrey Soros (the children of his late brother), neither of whom employs the pseudonym 'Marc Mezvinsky' or is furtively married to Chelsea Clinton."	false
2158	In January 2022, at least two studies from different research institutions showed that cannabidiol (CBD) and two other related chemical compounds found in hemp may hold promise in the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19.	"Two studies published in January 2022 found an association between the ingestion of certain non-psychoactive cannabinoids and negative COVID-19 tests, in one case indicating that the hemp compounds CBDA and CBGA may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells. In the other study, CBD was shown to inhibit the replication of the virus in infected cells. However, these studies were done in human cells and in mice — not humans. Furthermore, each study tested pure, specially formulated doses of these compounds, not commercially available products with CBD additives. Researchers say that further study is required to determine how, or if, CBD, CBDA, and CBGA can prevent or treat COVID-19 infection in human beings.

As the COVID-19 pandemic entered its second year, researchers continued to investigate potential therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of the respiratory disease. One such possibility was cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive chemical compound found in cannabis plants. Two studies published in January 2022 showed promise for the use of CBD and two related hemp compounds when it came to infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The findings were featured in a number of publications and on social media, including the meme below, sent to our team by Snopes readers:  Image courtesy of Snopes readersIt’s true that one study found that two cannabinoids, CBDA and CDGA, may prevent some coronavirus variants from entering human cells, while a second concluded that CBD may prevent the virus from replicating and further worsening infection. However, there are several caveats worth noting before rushing to the local dispensary. We explore those — and each individual study — below. Hemp and marijuana are both derived from cannabis plants, scientific name Cannabis sativa, the main difference between them being the amount of the psychoactive chemical tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) they contain. Hemp is a fiber made from marijuana plants that contains no psychoactive components and can be used as a source for a variety of things, from food supplements to cosmetics.With a THC content of less than .3%, consuming hemp will not create a high. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a chemical compound found in all cannabis plants — both marijuana and hemp — typically made from oil found in the plant’s stalks, leaves, and flowers. In the U.S., the only CBD drug product approved by the Food and Drug Administration is Epidiolex, which is used in the treatment of seizures. To be federally legal for consumer use, CBD products must be derived from hemp and contain no more than .3% THC. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 infects humans is a key component to combating the virus. Ongoing research since the onset of the pandemic has described the multistep entry process, in particular the spike protein that is known to bind to a human protein known as ACE2 receptor, or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, to infect humans. ACE2 is found on the surface of many cell types in the human body, which allows for plenty of targets for coronavirus to strike. Known collectively as “cell entry inhibitors,” that’s why so many drugs, vaccines and antibody therapies have targeted the spike protein.Once infected, the virus replicates itself to hijack the body, so to speak. Each of the studies we analyzed looked at these two key components of viral infection and how CBD or hemp may influence either the virus’ ability to infect cells or replicate once it has successfully invaded.  Public DomainTo understand how hemp may prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells, researchers at Oregon State University used a chemical screening technique known as affinity selection-mass spectrometry (AS-MS) to show how to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells (but not actual humans). AS-MS allows certain compounds known as botanical ligands, in this case hemp, to bind to selected targets, such as a spike protein. Publishing their work in the peer-reviewed Journal of Natural Products, the team showed that two compounds found in hemp, cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), could successfully bind to the spike protein and prevent it from binding to ACE2 in human cells, impairing the virus’ ability to infect. Both CBGA and CBDA were equally effective against the alpha and beta coronavirus variants. (The compounds were also effective against a pseudovirus that expresses a spike protein similar to the one found in SARS-CoV-2.) “These compounds can be taken orally and have a long history of safe use in humans,” said study author Richard van Breemen in a news release. “They have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2. CBDA and CBGA are produced by the hemp plant as precursors to CBD and CBG, which are familiar to many consumers. However, they are different from the acids and are not contained in hemp products.”Together, the findings show the potential to possibly treat and prevent infection, but the researchers caution that the use of CBDA and CBGA could be used as a compliment, not a substitution, for preventative measures like antiviral treatments and vaccination.  Virus particles are shown emerging from the surface of cells cultured in the lab. The spikes on the outer edge of the virus particles give coronaviruses their name, crown-like. NIAID-RML/Public DomainA second study published in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances also concluded that CBD can inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells and in mice — though again, not in humans. This time around, scientists at the University of Chicago treated human lung cells with a dose of CBD for two hours before exposing the cells to SARS-CoV-2 and monitoring for infection. While the treatment was not shown to prevent infection, it was shown to inhibit the virus’ ability to replicate within six hours of cells being infected. The CBD also had the same effect in two other types of cells, and three variants of SARS-CoV-2.Additionally, the team found that mice who were treated with CBD for one week before infection were also shown to suppress infection in the lungs and nasal passages, further suggesting that the CBD may slow replication of the virus. “CBD has anti-inflammatory effects, so we thought that maybe it would stop the second phase of COVID infection involving the immune system, the so-called ‘cytokine storm.’ Surprisingly, it directly inhibited viral replication in lung cells,” said study author Marsha Rosner in a news release.Finally, the team also analyzed the records of 1,212 patients from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative, a collection of clinical data related to COVID-19 in patients in the U.S. They found that those taking a medically prescribed oral solution of CBD for epilepsy tested positive for COVID-19 at lower rates than those who were not, which shows an association but not causation. While CBD may offer a potential preventative and treatment for COVID-19, the researchers of both studies concluded that the future clinical trials and research are required to determine whether CBD could actually treat or prevent COVID-19, particularly as neither analyzed CBD in actual humans but only in human cells, animals, and as part of a database analysis. Furthermore, neither study investigated potential risks associated with taking CBD and how consumption may impact certain populations, such as pregnant people. It should also be noted that the CBD used in the studies was produced in high purity, specially formulated doses in specific situations and not commercially available CBD products, many of which are made with additives.In short, it’s too early to tell whether CBD will help against COVID-19. That is an answer that further research hopes to find. In the meantime, CBD consumption is not to be used as a replacement for known protective measures like vaccination and existing public health guidelines. Curious about how Snopes' writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption?

4183	Mary Trump's tell-all book describes her walking in on her uncle Donald in bed with his daughter Ivanka.	"The month of July 2020 saw the release of ""Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man,” a tell-all book by Mary L. Trump, the niece of U.S. President Donald Trump. Although Trump's younger brother Robert sought to block publication of the work, it was released ahead of scheduled by publisher Simon & Schuster on July 14, 2020.While various news outlets obtained copies of the book and reported on its contents in advance of its publication, but ""Too Much and Never Enough"" proved to contain little new information that was truly shocking or surprising. Perhaps its most salacious revelation was Mary Trump's claim that her uncle had secretly paid someone to take the the SAT college-admissions exam in his place in order to ensure he recorded a high score.Prior to the book's official release, social media users circulated a purported excerpt from it, a passage in which Mary Trump allegedly described inadvertently walking in on her uncle in bed with his daughter Ivanka:(Mary L. Trump and Ivanka Trump are actually first cousins; Mary is not Ivanka's ""aunt."")This ""leaked"" excerpt was nothing more than a prurient fabrication, however. Although Donald Trump has made a number of comments about his daughter that some observers have found unsettling, nothing remotely like what is described above appeared in Mary Trump's book. Certainly an occurrence so shocking would have been mentioned by news outlets that obtained pre-release copies of the book, but none of them did, and we also searched the ebook version of ""Too Much and Never Enough"" subsequent to its official release and found no description that came close to matching the one displayed above.The only passage in the book we found that bore the slightest resemblance to the faux ""excerpt"" seen above — and it was a very slight resemblance — was the following paragraph:"	false
3230	"In March 2021, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene posed by an unauthorized ""Fort Pelosi"" sign on a security fence outside of the U.S. Capitol."	"A police officer was killed and a second one was injured when a driver crashed through security barriers at the U.S. Capitol just after 1 p.m. EDT on April 2, 2021, resulting in a lockdown at the Capitol.During a news conference, U.S. Capitol Police Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said the car rammed the two officers at what police call the north barrier, located at Delaware and Constitution avenues, then the driver got out and lunged at officers with a knife in his hand. Pittman said the man didn't comply with police commands and was fatally shot.Photographs from the scene showed the car had rammed through a black perimeter fence erected as a security measure after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The car came to a stop against a white barricade that blocks off the road:The incident sparked an online backlash against U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, who just two weeks prior had posted a photograph of herself posing next to a black fence outside of the Capitol with a sign mocking both the added security and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The sign read ""Welcome to Fort Pelosi"":The picture is real and, as of this writing, the tweet containing it is currently live on Greene's Twitter timeline. A street sign visible on the right side of the picture indicates she was standing on Independence Avenue, which is on the south side of the Capitol building (opposite of where the April 2 incident occurred).It's unclear to us whether Greene put the sign up herself or if someone else did.Whether the extra fencing around the Capitol was needed after the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection has been a point of controversy in Washington, D.C. And despite Greene's sign, the fencing is under the purview of U.S. Capitol Police, not Pelosi, and was erected by law enforcement and the military.On March 24, Capitol Police announced that an outer perimeter topped by concertina wire had been taken down, but an inner perimeter fence immediately around the Capitol building was still in place.This was not the first time Greene has spurred controversy. She ran unopposed in the 2020 election and drew immediate criticism for her record of support for various conspiracy theories, including Qanon.Greene also helped promote former U.S. President Donald Trump's disinformation campaign in which he falsely claimed that mass-scale fraud cost him the November 2020 election."	true
708	A photograph of bodies lined up in a ditch shows Ukrainians killed by Russians during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	"A photograph shared by pro-Vladimir Putin social media accounts purports to show the bodies of dead Ukrainians in an open ditch killed by Russians during their full-scale invasion of Ukraine:However, this picture predates the most recent Ukraine-Russia conflict by well over a decade, and depicts a mass burial site created during the First Chechnyan War. Several versions of the picture were published prior to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with the earliest example identified by Snopes dating back to at least 2006.The photograph appears to have been taken by Georgian photojournalist Shakh Aivazov, who worked for The Associated Press during several Russian wars. It is included in a gallery of the Georgian Museum of Photography attributed to him and labeled ""Chechnya, 1996."" These pictures appear to match video and other photographs of a graveyard on the outskirts of the Chechnyan capital of Grozny during the first Chechnyan war:A 2019 interview with Aivazov published by a Georgian media outlet included this photograph, as well. In that interview, Aivazov described the effect witnessing such burial sites had on him [via Google Translate]:A large pit has been cut lengthwise and many corpses have been laid to rest. Relatives came to identify them. I felt sick when I saw this scene."	false
2147	In 1963, Dutch businessman Alfred “Freddy” Heineken created a bottle that could also function as a brick to build houses in impoverished countries.	Curious about how Snopes' writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption? We've collected some posts that help explain how we do what we do. Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing.After a visit in the early 1960s to the Caribbean islands, then known as the Dutch Antilles, Dutch businessman Alfred Heineken was struck with inspiration from a seemingly odd source: garbage discarded about the island, some of which included empty beer bottles. His idea: to turn glass beer bottles into bricks of sorts by forming the Heineken seaweed-green beer bottles into a rectangular shape that could be used to build housing. As incredible as it sounds, this claim is true and documented online by the official curators of the Heineken Collection Foundation. They wrote:Heineken approached the architect John Habraken, director of the Foundation for Architects’ Research (SAR), with the idea of designing a re-usable bottle that could serve as a building block after use. It seemed that a project had been born. Habraken designed a bottle that could indeed be used for building purposes, but it was not in the least like the beer bottle that Heineken had envisaged.Habraken’s second design was the WOBO bottle with which we are now familiar. A bottle with flat sides, provided with relief and a concave bottom. In 1964, Heineken had a total of 100,000 of these bottles (both 35 cl. and 50 cl.) made by the Vereenigde Glasfabrieken in Leerdam, and had this design patented world-wide.Despite the promising design of the WOBO bottle, the idea never took off and was largely met with resistance from the Heineken marketing team, which was concerned that it would “damage the image and open the company to claims over wrong usage of the bottle.”  The WOBO bottle design. Heineken Collection FoundationBut didn’t stop Alfred from constructing a structure of his own — a garden house found on his property: Alfred Heineken's WOBO garden house built on his personal property. Heineken Collection FoundationIt appears Alfred may have just been slightly ahead of his time. In 1975, an author by the name of Martin Pawley penned “Garbage Housing,” a 120-page book that described the “world shortage of resources” and their overconsumption. To highlight ways in which societies might scale back their consumption, Pawley described the WOBO bottle as possible solution to encourage the concept of secondary use. Taking the example of Heineken’s World Bottle, designed in a shape that makes it possible to use jettisoned bottles as building bricks, [Pawley] shows how a whole range of valuable materials which are at present simply wasted could be designed in a way to provide further use; and in doing so create what would in effect become an enormous world resource. The book prompted a response from Habraken, who wrote to Alfred that “the WOBO initiative of ten years ago is now widely seen as the first industrial initiative to develop recyclable packaging.” Although Alfred supported the endeavor, it would ultimately fall through due to logistical issues. Fast Company further detailed the design process and vision in its 2013 piece, “Heineken’s Lost Plan to Build Houses Out Of Beer Bottles.”  	true
1318	Sucking on a penny or a breath mint will help someone who has been drinking defeat a breathalyzer test.	"Everyone is in favor of keeping drunk drivers off the road, but no one ever wants to think of himself as falling into that category. For this reason, we adore the notion of little easy-to-do tricks that will keep us, the occasional over-indulgers, from being rounded up and tossed into the hoosegow as if we were actual miscreants who make our roads dangerous. It's not for those lawless killers who routinely get totaled than slip behind the wheel of a car, you understand. It's for us, the ordinary folk who get pulled over that one time we had a drink on our way home.Some examples the Snopes newsroom has seen on the internet include: [Collected on the Internet, 1994]A distant friend relayed this one. He was drunk and a cop pulled him over. He said the first thing he did was stuff a handful of pennies in his mouth and then spit them out as the officer approached the car. He said a short time later he was given a breathalizer test and because of the copper alloy residue (or whatever) the breathalizer tester went bonkers and they couldn't get an accurate evaluation and was off the hook.[Collected on the Internet, 2001]Here's something I heard a little over a year ago supposedly from a friend of a friend. At the time my friend told me that he heard that several states were trying to outlaw Icebreakers gum because it would disguise alcoholic content in breathalyzer tests and the readings would come out negative. As far as I know, Icebreakers is still being sold and I have yet to hear about a real lawsuit or a law being made to stop it.All imaginary halos and denials aside, none of these tricks work. Pennies held in the mouth no more fool the breathalyzer than would hopping on one foot while reciting the Lord's Prayer. There's nothing magical about the presumed copper content of a one-cent piece that negates the test. (From 1982 on, the U.S. one-cent coin has been made of 97.5% zinc encased in a copper coating.) Likewise, although mints and various other breath treatments are at least somewhat effective at masking the odor of alcohol on the tippler's breath, they do nothing to affect the presence of demon rum in that person's system. In other words, even if the smell is not detectable, the alcohol itself is.Older breathalyzers measured the chemical reaction between the amount of alcohol expelled on the breath and the contents of a vial in a breathalyzer machine. Newer machines measure breath alcohol by the process of infrared absorption, which entails passing an infrared light wave through a sample chamber containing the subject's breath, then measuring the drop in the intensity of the light and using that to calculate the amount of alcohol in the subject's breath. It's important to delay the test for 20 minutes after the person being examined has had a drink else ""mouth alcohol"" might interfere with the results. (Traces of booze generally remain in the mouth for 10 to 15 minutes after a drink is taken. The 20 minute deprivation period allowed for this to dissipate.)Additionally, many police officers assert breathalyzer results can be compromised by the subject's burping while being tested (which they believe would increase the presence of mouth alcohol). That belief is more lore than science: According to a 1992 study performed at the Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, belching had no effect on breathalyzer results. In one study subjects belched and blew into the instrument 15 minutes after taking a drink of alcohol; the reading was recorded then compared to another reading taken one minute later. There was no difference. Even when people would bring up a belch of gas directly into the instrument, there was no effect.Folks have done many strange things over the years in an effort to beat the machine. In a case heard in an Alberta courtroom in March 1985, 28-year-old Dave Zurfluh, who was stopped on suspicion of driving while under the influence, ate his undershorts in the belief they would soak up the excess alcohol in his system. According to Constable Bill Robinson, the arresting officer, he heard ""some ripping and tearing"" from the back of the cruiser. ""I looked in the back and he was tearing pieces of the crotch of his underwear out and stuffing them in his mouth,"" Robinson testified.We've no idea if the eating of the shorts was what got him off, but Dave Zurfluh was acquitted of all charges because he'd blown .08 on the breathalyzer, the legal limit.In March 2005, a 59-year-old accused drunk driver in Ontario tried to foil a police breathalyzer by stuffing his mouth full of feces. He had been taken to the police station for testing, where he grabbed a handful of his own waste ""and placed it in his mouth, attempting to trick the breathalyzer machine,"" said Sgt. James Buchanan of the South Simcoe Police. It didn't work. The machine registered two readings of intoxication from samples the suspect provided. Both were more than twice the legal limit.As for the ""penny"" canard, that too has been tried in real life. In August 2000, one East Hampton man pulled over for drunk driving was discovered to be sucking on a penny when approached for a breathalyzer sample. His speech was slurred, he couldn't stand up straight, and he failed all the standard sobriety tests, yet still he had faith in the ""penny under the tongue"" trick to save the day.The notion that ""smell of booze equals booze itself"" fuels the erroneous belief that breath improvers are effective counters to the breathalyzer test. Possibly in an attempt to cash in on this confusion, in 1997 a British company began marking ""Breathalyzer Blitz,"" mints advertised for their ability to rid breath of alcohol odors. The spokespeople for Blitz Design Corp. were always upfront in their denials that their mints would negate breathalyzer test results, but the name of the confection itself might well have misled many into believing these particular candies would have that effect.Also, those whose tipple of choice was Zima (a sweet colorless beverage especially favored by the younger set) were often under the mistaken impression that the booze in that particular concoction was not detectable via breathalyzer examination. Because Zima leaves little smell on the breath, its devotees concluded the alcohol contained in the beverage itself would prove similarly hard to pin down. They were wrong, of course, because Zima contained about the same amount of alcohol as ordinary beer, and the breathalyzer would always pick up on that. Yet this tidbit of lore proved surprisingly hardy and was often swapped among teens as a ""Did you know?"" revelation.SourcesAyers, Chuck.   ""Police React Coolly to 'Breathalyzer' Mints.""

5307	"Sweden has begun referring to ""Christmas"" as ""Winter Celebration"" in to appease their Muslim population."	"In December 2018, a rumor that Sweden had begnu referring to ""Christmas"" as ""Winter Celebration"" in an effort to appease their ""extremist"" Muslim population started to circulate on social media:This errant rumor was not based on any official decree from the Swedish government, but rather on a single innocuous headline published by the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenskan on 2 December 2018.The Swedish news outlet used the headline ""Malmö flyttar vinterfirandet till Stortorget av säkerhetsskäl"" for their report on a location change of an annual celebration held in the city of Malmö. Anti-Islam web sites such as Jihad Watch and Voice of Europe noticed that the newspaper used the term ""vinterfirandet"" (winter celebration) instead of ""Julen"" (Christmas) in their headlines and started pushing the notion that Sydsvenskan used secular terms in order to avoid offending Muslims.These critics apparently failed to notice that variations of the word ""Julen"" were used repeatedly in the article in question. In fact, the subhead alone included two mentions of Christmas -- ""Julen"" translates to Christmas and ""juldagarna"" refers to Christmas Day:The complete headline and subhead can be loosely translated as follows:
Malmö moves the winter celebration to Stortorget for safety reasonsLast Christmas, Malmö put up terrorism barriers around the Gustav Adolf Square. This year, the city will be moving its winter celebrations to the safer Stortorget [public square]. Here, Steve Angello's charity project for Malmö will be reported and the Winter Games will begin after Christmas.Furthermore, we examined several other articles published by Sydsvenskan to see if they habitually replaced references to ""Christmas"" with ""Winter Celebration,"" and we found that they have an entire Christmas (Julen) section with articles about Christmas songs (jullåt), Christmas trees (julgransodlingar), Christmas gifts (julklappar), and even a Christmas calendar (julkalender).This rumor can also be debunked by visiting the official website of the Swedish government. The site contains a few pages that explain various customs and traditions to foreign visitors, including one page chock full of Christmas references:"	false
6140	Accused school shooter Nikolas Cruz has ties to the Islamic State or other Islamic extremist groups.	"In the aftermath of a deadly high school shooting in south Florida in February 2018, conspiracy theorist web site Infowars offered speculation about the suspected perpetrator's ideological affiliations, claiming that his clothing was similar to that of ISIS fighters and pointing to a purported Instagram screen shot showing a Google search for ""Allahu Akbar.""The Infowars article carried the headline ""Reported Florida Shooter Discussed 'Allahu Akbar' on Instagram Profile,"" raising the specter of Islamic extremism as a potential motive in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed at least 17 people. Infowars continued by proclaiming that ""Additionally, the shooter’s garb is very similar to the style worn by ISIS fighters in Syria.""No evidence supports a hypothesis that the suspected assailant Nikolas Cruz was affiliated with any Islamic terrorist network or is himself a Muslim, and an overwhelming amount evidence to the contrary indicates otherwise.According to the Miami Herald, friends of Cruz confirmed that the referenced Instagram account (cruz_nikolas), which has since been deleted, was his. On this account, Cruz appears to have posted several photographs of himself holding a variety of knives and firearms, often covering his face with a black scarf. But in four out of five images of himself Cruz was wearing a United States Army hat, unlikely accoutrement for an ""ISIS fighter.""The second flimsy piece of evidence offered by Infowars was another post on the cruz_nikolas Instagram account showing a screenshot of a Google search for ""Allahu Akbar,"" an Arabic phrase meaning roughly, ""God is great."" This phrase is commonly used in a variety of everyday circumstances (particularly prayer) but it has also been exclaimed by violent Islamic militants before and during attacks.However, far from being an indication of Cruz's religious devotion or support for Islamic extremism, his comments next to the image suggest he was not previously aware of the meaning of ""Allahu Akbar,"" and that he was hostile to Muslims and Islam in general:According to a version of the post saved by Google's web cache, Cruz wrote: ""Well at least we now know what it means when a sand durka says 'allahu Akbar.'"" (""Durka"" is a nonsense word used in the context of Islam and especially Islamist terrorism, usually with a derogatory or dismissive connotation. It originated in scenes from the movie Team America: World Police.)Ocean Parodie, a former schoolmate of Cruz, corroborated the latter's antipathy towards Islamic extremism and Muslims in general in an interview with the Daily Beast:Cruz always had his hair short and had a penchant for wearing patriotic shirts that ""seemed really extreme, like hating on"" Islam, Parodie said. The suspected gunman would also deride Muslims as ""terrorists and bombers."""	false

Several nearby residents reported hearing a blast at some point between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., as reported by The Guardian:While there is still a lot of conflicting information, one version has it that at around 3am on Tuesday morning a large explosion occurred. The blast was reportedly loud enough to be heard 80km away. Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia of orchestrating the destruction of the dam. ""The Russian Federation's detonation of the dam,"" the Ukrainian Foreign Minister said in a statement, was ""a terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure, which aims to cause as many civilian casualties and destruction as possible""Meanwhile, as reported by CNN, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed the attack was ""planned and carried out by order received from Kyiv, from the Kyiv regime,"" adding that, ""The Kyiv regime must bear full responsibility for all the consequences.""  The consequences, at the time of this reporting, are already significant. The dam held back, according to The Guardian, ""an estimated 18 cubic kilometres of water, about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah."" Several populated regions including the frontline city of Kherson are downstream from the dam. Among the first photographs and videos purporting to show post-failure flooding came from the administrative section of Nova Kakhovka, where swans were viewed swimming in front of ornate public buildings:These images are authentic and correctly attributed to events following the June 6 failure of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The area in which the videos were taken is directly downstream from the dam and only meters from the bank of the Dnieper river below it: (Bing Maps / Snopes)The city is presently controlled by Russian forces. In a video uploaded on June 6, 2023, acting Russian-appointed governor of the Kherson Region, Vladimir Saldo, told Russian state-controlled media RIA Novosti that everything was fine. ""[I] Just drove through the streets, people are calm, gas stations are working, some shops are working, even enterprises are working,"" he said in front of the same flooded area seen in viral photographs. Russian state media's photographs of this flooded administrative center match those reported on by other outlets, including drone footage aired by The Guardian. Further, and in spite of assurances by Saldo, numerous outlets have spoken to residents on the ground who have experienced massive flooding and panic. As reported by Reuters:Residents contacted by Reuters said the mood was tense in the town of Nova Kakhovka, which sits on the Russian-controlled southern bank of the Dnipro River, on the downriver side of the dam. Russian soldiers were patrolling the streets, several local people said.""All approaches to the river are blocked for the local population by Russian invaders. Getting close, and especially taking a photo or video, is deadly. They say they are ready to shoot without warning,"" said one local man, Hlib.""If you come a metre closer than allowed, they immediately start yelling obscenities. We're still allowed to go to the store, but we don't know what orders will be given next.""Yevheniya, a female resident, said the water was up to the knees of Russian soldiers walking the main street in high rubber boots. ""If you try to go somewhere they don't allow, they immediately point their machine guns at you,"" she said.""More and more water is coming every hour, it's very dirty."""	true
145	"The Human Meat Project is a real organization that solicits human cadavers to be processed into ""human meat"" for human consumption."	"In late 2022, we began receiving inquiries as to the authenticity of a website called the Human Meat Project, which purports to solicit the donation of human bodies and body parts to be butchered and distributed as food for human consumption. ""By donating bodies for human consumption, we are taking action to solve overpopulation, which leads to climate change and the greenhouse effect caused by the mass farming of livestock animals in order to feed the world,"" the website claims. ""The practice of cannibalism is not uncommon in living beings. In both the animal kingdom and our human history, the consumption of one's own species has existed."" ""Donor card"" page from the Human Meat Project website. (HumanMeatProject.com)Despite such claims, when we actually looked into it we found that the website is a performance art project, not a real experiment to see if cannibalism can save the world. ""This is purely a conceptual art project and will not be acted out in real life,"" the site's Terms and Conditions page states. In essence, the entire website is an art exhibition.Real or not, the concept has not gone over well with the public. On social media we found video clips like the following expressing shock and horror at the proposal that ""human meat"" be produced for wide consumption, whatever the humanitarian justification: Sadly, we were able to find no information at all about the artist(s) behind the Human Meat Project, but we reached out via the website's contact form and will update this article if we learn more. The Human Meat Project is reminiscent of a 2001 internet hoax called ManBeef.com, a faux commercial website that promoted itself as ""Your choice for quality human meats, and gourmet human meat products."" "	false
1872	Barack Obama was president when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005.	"As damage from Hurricane Harvey continued to grow in Texas in late August 2017, some Twitter users sought to defend President Donald Trump's response to the disaster by criticizing the actions of his predecessor, Barack Obama during similarly pervasive flooding in Louisiana in 2016. Other users took that argument even further, knocking Obama for not ""doing enough"" to help Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina.!function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src=""https://rumble.com/embedJS/ucxbq""+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+""/?url=""+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+""&args=""+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, ""script"", ""Rumble"");       Rumble(""play"", {""video"": ""v4tygd"",""div"": ""rumble_v4tygd"",""autoplay"":2});The argument that Obama did not do enough after Hurricane Katrina lashed New Orleans, however, ignores the fact that Obama was not president at the time. Katrina made landfall in August 2005, during George W. Bush's presidency.   Obama -- who was a Democratic Party senator representing Illinois when the storm hit -- was not elected president until November 2008. However, Obama did meet with Katrina evacuees on 5 September 2005 in Houston, Texas alongside former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush:Online speculation also mounted around some users posting anti-Obama tweets, questioning whether they were actually Russian misinformation ""bots"":One of the suspected bots, @DaNolans, denied being an illegitimate account in a post on 29 August 2017:I was taking the piss outta Trump with this folks. Check TL. Never woulda thought people truly believe such nonsense. Scary times #notabotBen Nimmo, a senior fellow for information defense for the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab who has written about ""bot"" attacks, told us that he scanned mentions of Obama and Katrina between 24 August 2017 and 30 August 2017. He said:The majority of tweets, and the most popular tweets, all mocked the idea of blaming the Katrina reaction on Obama. The anti-Obama messaging does not appear to have penetrated. Of the accounts in the image, one is now suspended and the others show varying degrees of activity; one claims to have been joking. There doesn't appear to be major bot (i.e. automated) traffic involved.While it is unclear how many of the recent spate of anti-Obama tweets were manufactured or made in jest, an August 2013 survey conducted by the Democrat-oriented Public Policy Polling showed that 29 percent of Louisiana Republicans believed that Obama was to blame for the oft-criticized federal response to Katrina. Another 44 percent were reportedly unsure whether Obama or George W. Bush was at fault, while 28 percent blamed Bush.That mindset was brought to national television in a September 2016 segment on Comedy Central's Daily Show, which featured a Trump supporter who said he believed that Obama ""had a big part"" in the 9/11 attacks because he was ""never in the office"" at the time. When asked why Obama would not have been in the Oval Office during the 11 September 2001 attacks (which occurred more than seven years before he was elected president), the man said:"	false
1278	Halloween is the second-biggest U.S. holiday in terms of retail sales.	Those of us who set forth on our first trick-or-treating expeditions four or five decades ago don’t need to see any statistics to know that the Halloween-related retail business has grown tremendously during that period. Way back when, many retailers didn’t carry much more in the way of Halloween supplies than some candy, boxes of costumes, and a few cardboard bats and skeletons for decorating windows and doors, and that sort of merchandise generally didn’t appear on store shelves until at least the latter part of September. In recent years, however, economic forecasters said people spent an average of $9 billion annually on Halloween-related expenses, according to surveys conducted by the National Retail Federation (NRF). Some stores start stocking aisles with candy, costumes and decorations for purchase as early as July.As of late September 2022, almost 70% people in the U.S. were preparing to celebrate the Oct. 31 holiday, budgeting an average of $100 each on costumes, parties or other goods, according to the NRF's surveys. Combined, the agency expected shoppers to spend a record of $10.6 billion to mark Halloween in 2022, surpassing the 2021 record of $10.1 billion. NRF said in a Sept. 19 press release:While total spending on costumes, decorations and candy is expected to reach record levels, there was a slight drop in spending on greeting cards. Unsurprisingly, costumes account for the biggest area of Halloween purchases. Spending on kids’ and adult costumes is expected to total $2.9 billion, the highest amount since 2017. Pet spending is expected to exceed last year's record high, reaching $710 million.Any discussion of booming seasonal retail sales inevitably prompts comparisons to other holidays, leading to the legend that Halloween has now worked its way up to the No. 2 spot on the holiday sales charts, just behind the winter holiday season including Christmas. However, according to the NRF's annual surveys conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics, annual spending on Halloween items or celebrations placed the holiday behind several others, such as Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day and Easter. Here's how much U.S. consumers were expected to spend, or indeed spent, in recent years, per the surveys:It’s easy to see why people might get the impression that Halloween sales have crept up just behind those of Christmas, as those occasions are the centers of our two longest, most “visible” holiday seasons: Halloween engenders home displays that rival or surpass those of the winter holidays in elaborateness (if not yet in ubiquity), and Halloween is the only celebration that prompts widespread public wearing of distinctive, highly noticeable apparel. 	false
5243	Returning Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi proposed to fund the building of President Trump's border wall in exchange for a bill banning the ownership of firearms by any U.S. citizen.	"On 2 January 2019, one day before Congress returned to session with Democrat Nancy Pelosi newly reinstalled as Speaker of the House, social media users shared posts claiming Rep. Pelosi was offering to fund President Trump's border wall in exchange for a full ban on gun ownership in the United States.The posts linked to an article from the BeBest.website which stated, in part:As the new Congress prepares to take control tomorrow, presumptive Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a final legislative offer to President Trump this morning : the border wall will be funded and built – in exchange for passing a bill banning the ownership and use of all firearms in the United States by private citizens. Pelosi’s edict sent shockwaves through Washington.Pelosi noted that Fema and U.N. troops, already mobile from Operation Jade Helm, are ready to begin house-by-house confiscation, and sites in the Nevada desert and Utah plains have been readied for mass weapon meltdowns and burials. Liberal gun legislation activists like David Hogg and Taylor Swift have expressed overwhelming support for the ban.To put the story in a broader context, the federal government was then in the twelfth day of a shutdown over a budget stalemate in which the funding of Trump's border wall was the main point of contention. With a new Democratic Party majority controlling the House, all eyes were on Speaker Pelosi to come up with a way out of the impasse.As should be obvious to anyone with even the most basic understanding of American politics and the U.S. Constitution, Pelosi's offer, if real, wasn't just a non-starter -- it was an absurdity. Federal legislation banning gun ownership by private citizens in the United States would meet such resistance it would never make it to the President's desk. If it somehow did and the President (against all expectations) signed it into law, the Supreme Court would strike it down as unconstitutional.But the reality is that Pelosi made no such offer. The source of the story, BeBest.website, is part of a network of websites and social media accounts (America's Last Line of Defense, or LLOD) that publishes fictional, politically divisive content under the rubric of ""satire.""A disclaimer on all LLOD sites, including BeBest.website, states the following:"	false
43	"A viral article purporting to be the obituary of Margaret Ruth Groening, mother of ""The Simpsons"" creator Matt Groening, is authentic and accurately describes the origins of the names of some of the show's characters."	"For decades, ""The Simpsons"" has been the inspiration behind a number of internet hoaxes and rumors, from the supposed prediction of the Donald Trump presidency (false) and the foretelling of Pokemon Go (also false), to a long list of political pranks and online bamboozles.And, in 2021, a tweet that was shared to Twitter on April 1 by music publicist Eric Alper drew a comparison between Margaret Groening's obituary and Marge from ""The Simpsons."" Despite the conspicuous date of the posting, it did not appear to be an April Fools' joke.The claim that Margaret Ruth Groening inspired the blue-haired motherly figure in ""The Simpsons"" is true. Margaret was indeed the mother of Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons. And the names of her three children inspired the main characters of the classic 1989 adult cartoon. (Though the full name of the fictional Marge Simpson character was Marjorie. The only significant Margaret in the Simpsons universe is Maggie the baby.)An obituary published in The Oregonian on May 6, 2013, (archived here) described Margaret Ruth Groening, who died in her sleep on April 22, 2013, at the age of 94. Margaret married her Linfield College classmate, Homer Groening, in 1941, whom she chose because he ""made her laugh the most.""Margaret and Homer supported the Oregon Symphony, the Portland Trail Blazers and many local yarn shops (Margaret was a talented needlework artist). Besides Homer, Margaret was preceded in death by her oldest daughter, Patty, who died in Jan., 2013. She is survived by her brother, Arnold; her children, Mark, Matt, Lisa and Maggie; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.According to the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), Matt Groening was born in 1954 in Springfield, Oregon, and grew up two hours away in Portland. His biography noted that he was the son of Homer Groening, an animator and producer of surf movies, and was married to Margaret.""Many members of the Simpson family are named for members of his own family: Homer, Marge, Maggie, Lisa and Patty,"" wrote the website.It's no coincidence that The Simpsons family of five have the same names as Margaret's children. In a 1990 interview, Matt Groening said that the character of Bart Simpson — son of Homer and Marge — was based partly on Dennis the Menace and himself as a child. Bart's original name was going to be Matt, but he changed it because it sounded too closely related. Fittingly, Bart is an anagram of ""brat."" Lisa Groening, Matt's sister in real life — and Bart's sister in cartoon form — also worked in entertainment. And Matt himself was born in Springfield, Oregon, a town of more than 60,000 residents that also served as the inspiration of the fictional Ohio-based town in the cartoon show.And it's not just Matt Groening's family members who inspired the characters on the show. NPR noted in 2012 that much of the content in ""The Simpsons"" was prompted by real people and places in his life.The names of many characters on the show — Flanders, Kearney, Lovejoy — correspond to street names in Portland, Ore. Indeed, Groening says his goal was to 'name every character after streets in Portland, but we were in a hurry so I dropped the idea.'"	true
4188	Facebook allowed a pro-pedophilia ad to run on their social media network.	"In mid-2020, social media users began circulating a purported advertisement promoting the concept that ""Pedophilia is a natural sexual orientation"" and that ""It is in our responsibility to reflect and to overcome our negative feelings about pedophiles."" The alleged ad image carried logos implying the support of organizations such as TED and NAMbLA and was said to have been allowed by Facebook to run on their social media network:In fact, this ""ad"" never ran on Facebook, nor was it endorsed by TED. It was a years-old hoax created from a stock image.Back in May 2018, the University of Würzburg in Germany held a TEDx-sponsored event with the theme of “Future Societys” [sic], at which a speaker gave a controversial presentation on the subject of “Why our perception of pedophilia has to change” and stated that ""pedophilia is an unchangeable sexual orientation."" (TEDx events ""are organized independently under a free license granted by TED"" and ""are not controlled by TED,"" according to the parent organization.)Spurred by a Breitbart article about the controversy created by that TEDx presentation (dubbed ""#TEDogate""), users on the 4chan imageboard website began creating and posting disparaging memes about it, including the one displayed above:"	false
469	A photograph showing a man with a Nazi swastika tattoo is Mauricio Garcia, who opened fire in the parking lot of a mall in Allen, Texas, in May 2023 before police fatally shot him.	"On May 6, 2023, a heavily armed man opened fire in the parking lot of an Allen, Texas, mall. The shooter, whom police killed after he fatally shot eight people and wounded seven, was later identified as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia. The New York Times, and then later the open-source investigative outlet Bellingcat, tied Garcia to a profile on the Russian language social media site OK.ru. That account, whose profile photograph includes a smiley face with a Hitler mustache, contains myriad references to, or images of, Nazi symbolism, including what is potentially a faceless selfie showcasing a Nazi swastika and SS tattoo:As explained in detail on Bellingcat.com, photographs of other tattoos in which Garcia's face was shown demonstrate that the person in this selfie with these tattoos was the person who opened fire at the mall. In addition to that visual evidence, the profile betrays Garcia's plans ahead of time.Several conservative commentators, as well as Twitter owner Elon Musk, have raised doubts in the face of this evidence about the claim that the shooter espoused neo-Nazi views.Conservative pundit Andy Ngo, for instance, expressed disbelief that a ""brown face"" could be associated with white supremacy:Instead of refuting the evidence, Ngo attacked Bellingcat as a site that ""has sourcing from intelligence agencies"" and ""employs radical leftist writers."" (Bellingcat recently made news as the first organization to conclusively identify Air Force reservist Jack Teixeira as allegedly being responsible for sharing classified information on Discord servers.)Others, including Musk, suggested it was suspicious that an American would post Nazi screeds on a Russian-language social media website. A few hours after the shooting, authorities released the name, age, and date of birth of the shooter: Mauricio Garcia, age 33, born Oct. 24, 1989. While the profile on OK.ru uses the name ""PsychoVision 5"" and not Mauricio Garcia, that profile, first reported by The New York Times, listed the same birthday. More significantly, the owner of this profile uploaded several pictures and documents containing the name ""Mauricio Garcia"" and with that date of birth. For example, an April 5, 2023, post to that profile shows an image of a speeding ticket with Garcia's name and date of birth visible. Another upload was of a childhood identification card bearing the same. These posts were uploaded well before the shooting.While the profile clearly contains this identifying information, it also contains information linking its owner to the shooting itself. When officers killed Garcia, he was wearing, among other things, a patch bearing the acronym ""RWDS"" — short for ""right wing death squad,"" as reported by NPR:Police suspect his ideology might be linked to his motive, NPR has confirmed. While it is an ongoing investigation, evidence suggests that Garcia held far-right extremist beliefs.At the time of his death, officials say Garcia was wearing a patch with the acronym ""RWDS"" — which stands for ""Right Wing Death Squad."" A picture of a flack jacket with an RWDS patch was uploaded to the PsychoVision 5 profile on April 21, 2023. Further, Bellingcat reported, the owner of the profile shared evidence suggesting he had already chosen a target for the mass shooting weeks earlier:Three weeks prior to the shooting, photographs of the eventual site of the mass shooting were shared on the OK account, as well as details of peak times at the mall based on Google Maps information.The last post made on this account came just hours before the shooting. Ngo and other early doubters asserted that the photograph of a man's chest with SS and swastika tattoos was not necessarily that of Garcia, as the picture was shot from the neck down and contained no face. A debunking of this argument provides final proof that the man responsible for the shooting is the same man with the Nazi swastika on his chest, and that the man with the swastika is the owner of the OK.ru profile. While no face is depicted, other tattoos were clearly visible. Those tattoos, in turn, appeared in photographs that revealed yet other tattoos on Garcia's body. Those other tattoos were photographed on the body of the man who opened fire on a crowd at the Allen mall, as reported by Bellingcat:Although Garcia's face is not visible in the pictures, tattoos that can be seen on his arms match other photos where his face can be seen. For example, the 1 of the 10/6 (potentially a reference to the Mad Hatter of Alice in Wonderland) tattoo he has is visible on his left upper arm in the swastika tattoo picture. He posted a photograph of this 10/6 tattoo, that also showed tattoos of the Punisher logo and the words ""Deus Vult"", on his inner right arm on Odnoklassniki in March 2022. The same Punisher logo and ""Deus Vult"" tattoos can be seen in various photographs and videos on his OK page, including an August 2022 video of him at a shooting range. Notice the left hand tattoo in the image immediately above that matches earlier images from the OK profile and photos taken from the scene of the shooting.In the image below where Garcia's face is visible, the same Punisher and part of the ""Deus Vult"" tattoo can again be seen on his inner left arm.Ultimately, Ngo would concede that Bellingcat's Aric Toller ""likely did find a social media account belonging to the Allen, Texas gunman that featured brown Latino neo-Nazi propaganda."" "	true
5772	"The Mayor of Minneapolis didn't allow fireworks on the 4th of July, but he did allow a ""Muslim animal sacrifice"" at Vikings Stadium."	"In August 2018, a bit of Islamophobic copypasta started making its way around social media, asserting that the mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota had canceled a 4th of July city fireworks display but allowed ""Muslim animal sacrifice"" to be held in the city's U.S. Bank Stadium (home of the Minnesota Vikings football team) the following month:This copypasta was based on a bit of fake news, a fear-mongering report about the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, and a misreading of two genuine news reports.Fake NewsOn 10 June 2018, the Last Line of Defense web site published an article positing that the Muslim mayor of Minneapolis had ""canceled the 4th of July"":
Mayor Ahneid al Ahmed of Haskentot, Minnesota has done the unthinkable and canceled the 4th of July. According to his office, the city has no desire to spend money on something so frivolous. Muslim spokesman Art Tubolls said:“This city elected our mayor to do what is best. We don’t hink buying a bunch of flags and fireworks and spending a day celebrating nationalism like nazis is a good idea.”This was not a genuine news story about the mayor of Minneapolis, who is neither named ""Ahneid al Ahmed"" nor a Muslim. (The city's actual mayor is Jacob Frey.) The Last Line of Defense is part of a network of sites that engages in political trolling under the guise of proffering ""satire.""This junk news piece may have prompted some confusion, as it resembled a genuine news story about a nearby Minnesota city. The mayor of St. Paul did cancel the city's Independence Day firework show due to budgetary concerns:St. Paul will go without the rockets’ red glare on Independence Day this year.Mayor Melvin Carter announced that the city won’t hold a Fourth of July fireworks event.The cancellation may foreshadow of what could be a difficult budget season. Carter’s announcement, posted to Facebook, cited concerns about the city’s budget climate.Minneapolis, on the other hand, hosted multiple firework shows on July 4th.Fear-Mongering Reports About Eid al-AdhaThe Muslim celebration of Eid al-Adha is also referred to as the ""Feast of Sacrifice."" The holiday, which honors Ibrahim's (Abraham's) willingness to sacrifice his son at God's command, is celebrated by Muslims around the world. In many places, Muslims observe that holiday by  sacrificing an animal and then sharing its meat with the poor:To commemorate God's test of Ibrahim, many Muslim families sacrifice an animal and share the meat with the poor. They also are required to donate to charities that benefit the poor. Muslims also routinely exchange presents during the holiday.When it was announced that U.S. Bank Stadium would be hosting a Eid al-Adha festival, the Islamophobic web site ""Bare Naked Islam"" published an article about the upcoming event imploring readers to ""imagine"" 50,000 Muslims at the stadium and displaying various photographs and videos of animal sacrifices from around the world.The following photograph, for instance, was taken in Lahore, Pakistan, in 2008:These photographs led many readers to mistakenly believe that the ""Super EID"" festival at U.S. Bank Stadium would also feature animal sacrifices, but that wasn't the case.Ahmed Anshur, executive director of Masjid Al-Ihsan Islamic Center in St. Paul and one of the organizers of ""Super EID,"" attempted to quell these fears, telling Minnesota Public Radio that no animal sacrifices would take place at the event:
Eid Al-Adha, the second Muslim holiday of the year, comes at the end of the pilgrimage. Its name in Arabic means the ""festival of sacrifice.""Muslims celebrate by sacrificing animals and donating meat to charity.But Ahmed Anshur, executive director of Masjid Al-Ihsan Islamic Center in St. Paul and one of the organizers, wants to be clear: The actual ritual will not take place at U.S. Bank Stadium.""Nobody is going to sacrifice an animal, or nobody is going to slaughter an animal in that field,"" he said. ""I can assure you that, 100 percent.""The Minneapolis Star Tribune filed a report after the 21 August 2018 celebration on  which stated that in fact no animal sacrifices had taken place at the stadium during the EID celebration:The holiday honors the prophet Ibrahim, also known as Abraham in Judaism and Christianity, and his willingness to sacrifice his son for God. It comes at the end of the annual hajj pilgrimage. It is one of the holiest days of the year for Muslims, who celebrate with prayer, shared meals and gifts."	false

5364	Transgender prisoner Karen White (formerly Stephen Wood) of West Yorkshire, England, who confessed to committing multiple rapes as a man, sexually assaulted female inmates after being transferred to a women's jail.	"On 11 October 2018, a Crown Court judge handed down a sentence of life imprisonment to Karen White of West Yorkshire, England, who had pleaded guilty to multiple counts of rape, sexual assault, and unlawful (malicious) wounding.The case was unusual, to say the least. As the Yorkshire Evening Post reported, White is a transgender female who committed at least one of the rapes years ago when she still identified as a male. Stranger still, she committed the assaults on female inmates after being transferred from a men's to a women's jail due to her declared gender change:Karen White, 52, previously known as Stephen Wood and David Thompson, ""used her persona to put herself into contact with vulnerable persons,"" a court heard.White began gender reassignment when she was first remanded into custody into a female prison, prosecutor Christopher Dunn told Leeds Crown Court.She began gender re-alignment after being sent to prison for stabbing a neighbour and it was then that police also probed allegations she had raped two vulnerable women.While in HMP New Hall -- a female prison in Wakefield, West Yorks -- she started wearing a wig, make-up and false breasts, the court heard. She then attacked two women inmates while at New Hall between September and October 2017 while on remand for other offences.White was actually accused of perpetrating four sexual assaults on female prisoners, though she only confessed to two, after previously claiming that she suffered from erectile dysfunction and couldn't have assaulted anyone at all. A report in the Daily Mail enumerated White's offenses:Prosecutor Charlotte Dangerfield told the court the first assault happened when White stood close to another inmate, touched her arm and exposed herself.For the second assault she made 'inappropriate comments about oral sex' and put the woman's hand on the 'defendant's left breast' so she could feel her padded bra.Miss Dangerfield said the third alleged assault involved White pushing herself indecently against another prisoner, and on the fourth incident she allegedly kissed an inmate on the neck.The rapes White confessed to occurred in 2003 and 2016. White (then known as Stephen Wood) was placed under arrest in the first instance, an attack on the pregnant wife of a friend, but the case wasn't prosecuted at the time for reasons that weren't divulged in the 2018 trial. The second occurrence came to light when police questioned a woman who had returned a letter White wrote to her from jail. She told them White had violently raped her five or six times over the course of a year.Prior to 2003, White had served jail time for indecent exposure and sexual assaults on children. More recently, according to the Guardian, she admitted to probation officers that she was still sexually interested in minors and would ""think nothing"" of abusing a child.The prosecuting attorneys openly questioned the sincerity of White's gender change in court. Prosecutor Chris Dunn referred to White as an ""alleged"" transgender female, pointing out that ""there is a smattering of evidence in this case that the defendant's approach to transition has been less than committed.""Addressing the defendant during sentencing, Judge Christopher Batty said: “You are a predator and highly manipulative and in my view you are a danger. You represent a significant risk of serious harm to children, to women and to the general public.”In any case, White will serve out her sentence in a men's prison. Although the decision to move her to a women's jail pending trial was rendered in accordance with a 2017 policy update emphasizing the right of prisoners to be treated ""according to the gender in which they identify,"" the Prison Service admitted that mistakes were made in White's case and publicly apologized.Jenny-Anne Bishop, a member of the transgender rights group Transforum, said the local board charged with deciding where prisoners should be incarcerated ought to have taken White's entire history of criminal offenses into account but didn't. Moreover, certain procedural steps that could have ensured White was placed in a facility where she wouldn't pose a risk to herself or others weren't taken.Despite what happened in White's case, Bishop defends the system, which is meant to protect transgender people from harm as well as the general prison population, as workable. ""It is almost the exception that proves the rule,"" she told the Guardian, ""you’ve just got to look at what went wrong and make sure it doesn’t happen again. No system is perfect."""	true

Regardless, people will still be able to simply use both Facebook and Instagram for free, in general.CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram update on Feb. 19 that the company would be launching Meta Verified, a subscription service focused on account verification. Meta Verified costs $11.99 a month on the web (desktop computer) and $14.99 a month on iOS or Android. According to a Meta news release, a company spokesperson directed us to when we reached out, the service includes a verified badge, proactive account protection, and increased visibility and reach. In order to sign up for the subscription, users are required to submit a form of government ID that matches the account profile name and a photograph of the account they're applying for.The spokesperson stressed Facebook and Instagram remain free to users, and that the company won't remove any features currently available for free, including account-security protections and scaled customer support. 	true
2616	A video shows a medicinal plant in India called oodhu paavai.	"In September 2021, a video supposedly showing a medicinal plant called oodhu paavai in Tamil blowing pollen out of its funnel-shaped structures went viral on social media:This video does not show a medicinal plant called oodhu paavai, a term that means ""blow puppet"" in the Tamil language, according to Google Translate. This is a computer-generated piece of art. It was created by Luke Penry, a ""3D/Motion Generalist"" and ""Abstract Nature Artist."" This artwork, entitled ""Jungle Pipes,"" was posted to Penry's Instagram page on Sept. 16. Penry noted that the audio in this video was created by @flank_audio and included several hashtags (such as #digitalart #blender3d #motiongraphics and #cinema4d) that clearly indicated that this was a digital piece of art, not a natural plant found in the wild.  Penry has created several other pieces of art showing surreal (and totally fictional) plants. Here's one posted on Sept. 23 entitled ""Branch Bloater.""Several of Penry's pieces are available to purchase as NFTs on Foundation.app. In the description of the ""Jungle Pipes"" piece, Penry notes that the video had caused ""much confusion in India,"" as the video was widely shared as if it was a genuine plant.This piece became the source of much confusion in India, when various channels were reposting it as the “Oodhu Paavai – A medicinal plant on the verge of extinction, only growing in dense rainforests, blowing its pollen with sound”"	false

"Claiming that various company's food products have somehow become contaminated with HIV/AIDS has been a prevalent form of hoax for many years, targeting foodstuffs from pineapples to canned goods to soft drinks.  A more recent wrinkle in that decades-old trope posited in 2018 that an employee of Cadbury, a British multinational confectionery company, was arrested for ""adding his HIV-infected blood"" to the company's products:This rumor was nothing more than a variant of an old hoax that was previously aimed at Pepsi, with virtually no difference other than the substitution of one company's name for another's:No warnings have been issued, nor any arrests made, in conjunction with a supposed HIV contamination of Cadbury products, and as we noted in a similar previous article, the possibility of such an occurrence's taking place is low to non-existent:"	false
5211	"New prohibitions on public drinking and cannabis use ""in every province of Canada"" were scheduled to come into force in July 2019."	"A blog with a pattern of publishing false and misleading stories about Canada claimed that a nationwide crackdown on public drinking and cannabis smoking was imminent in that country. In June 2019, Canada-Eh.info published a post with the headline, ""Canadians Can Be Fined $1,500 for Drinking or Smoking Weed in Public, Starting Next Month,"" which reported that:""Mayors are considering to bring [sic] this [sic] new tougher laws in every province of Canada, you will no longer will be able to consume alcohol or smoke weed responsibly in parks or on beaches. Fines vary from province to province, but they can be up to $1,000 in in provinces like British Columbia and Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador.""The report continued on to say: ""If you get caught with open alcohol in Toronto right now, you could face a fine of up to $125 and a whopping $230 in Vancouver. Tougher rules are coming for most people who like to consume alcohol or weed in public. Starting next month if you are caught drinking beer or smook [sic] weed in public, the police will pour out your alcohol and make you pay a fine $1,500.""As has been the case with previous Canada-Eh stories we have examined, the claims here were at times ambiguous and confusing. More broadly, the narrative of an imminent nationwide crackdown on public drinking and smoking in July 2019 — ""new tougher laws in every province of Canada"" — was false.As was the case with previous stories, Canada-Eh republished an almost-identical version of the post just two days later, on 12 June.Canada has no uniform nationwide policy on public alcohol consumption or cannabis use. Policies are determined by provincial governments or municipal authorities in individual cities and towns throughout the country. Most cities and provinces have historically prohibited public drinking (which belies the article's claim about a new crackdown on such behavior), but Canada's legalization of cannabis in 2018 prompted some governments to rethink their approach to drinking in public places, as the Canadian Press reported:As all corners of the country prepare for a seismic shift in how and where people consume marijuana, several cities are considering whether it would make sense to legalize drinking alcohol in parks as well — a move an expert said would bring antiquated laws in line with the way people already behave.""I think a lot of people who want to have a bottle of wine in a public park on a Sunday are probably going to be doing that anyway,"" said Mitchell Kosny, interim director of Ryerson University's School of Urban and Regional Planning. The idea of legalizing alcohol in parks and on beaches has come up in Toronto and Vancouver, both of which are in the midst of municipal elections and both of which are in provinces that will allow people to toke in public come Oct. 17.Kosny said he suspects the idea is floating around now because election candidates and front runners may want to appear ""open-minded."" Toronto Mayor John Tory floated the idea at an event Thursday, pointing out that it would seem counterintuitive to allow people to smoke pot in parks but not drink a beer — especially since people are already bringing wine and beer to their picnics.In Ontario, for example, smoking or vaping in any workplace or enclosed public place is prohibited, with the punishment ranging from a $1,000 fine for the first offense to $5,000 for subsequent offenses. However, the ban doesn't extend to smoking or vaping in open-air public spaces.While the province of Ontario had traditionally banned drinking alcohol in public, the government's 2019 budget, launched in April 2019, introduced a new tailgating permit to allow public alcohol consumption at certain sporting events and introduced a measure that would allow cities within Ontario to designate public areas, such as parks, for alcohol consumption.By contrast, authorities in the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, moved in 2018 to ban smoking on all public municipal properties such as roads and sidewalks, even in open air.As a further illustration of how complex the interaction of provincial and municipal authority in Canada is, Québec's provincial government introduced legislation in February 2019 that would prohibit public cannabis use but later reportedly resiled from those plans after the mayor and police chief in Montréal declared the regulations would be unenforceable."	false

569	Dominion Voting Systems deleted 2.7 million votes that were cast for U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020.	"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.The internet was flooded with false claims about voter fraud in the days following the 2020 U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, 2020. Many of these rumors centered around a piece of software from Dominion Voting Systems. We've addressed a few of these rumors in a previous article, but the most prevalent claim, and one that was spread by U.S. President Donald Trump himself on Nov. 12, 2020, was that Dominion software had deleted 2.7 million votes that had been cast for the incumbent:There is no truth to this claim. On Nov. 12, 2020, a coalition of federal and state officials, including members of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), released a statement calling the 2020 election the ""most secure in American history."" The statement went on to specifically address Trump's false claim about votes being deleted, writing that ""there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.""Here is the statement in full:The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result.When states have close elections, many will recount ballots. All of the states with close results in the 2020 presidential race have paper records of each vote, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. This is an added benefit for security and resilience. This process allows for the identification and correction of any mistakes or errors. There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.Other security measures like pre-election testing, state certification of voting equipment, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission's (EAC) certification of voting equipment help to build additional confidence in the voting systems used in 2020.While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too. When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections.Trump did not provide any evidence to support his false claim that 2.7 million votes were deleted by Dominion Software, but he did tag Channel Rion and One American News Network (OAN), a far-right web publisher that recently reported on these unsubstantiated claims. The OAN segment (which was archived by Mediate) claimed that an ""unaudited analysis of data obtained from Edison Research"" found that Dominion Voting Systems ""switched as many as 435,000 votes from President Trump to Joe Biden"" and that ""another 2.7 million Trump votes appear to have been deleted by Dominion."" Edison Research President Larry Rosin, however, disputed these claims. In a statement to the The Dispatch Fact Check, Rosin said: ""Edison Research created no such report and we are not aware of any voter fraud."""	false
524	A video shows a hunter getting attacked by a lion while posing with a recent kill.	"On 7 June 2016, YouTube user Jayden Tanner published a video purportedly showing ""leaked"" footage of a trophy hunter being attacked by a lion while posing for a photograph with another lion she had allegedly killed:The video was accompanied by the hashtag #stoptrophyhunting, and was shared with a message claiming that the video was taken in South Africa:I managed to get my hands on this video when I was in South Africa a couple of months ago, a hunter showed me and thought it was hilarious. For me this video highlights a distressing situation that the world needs to see.Every year trophy hunters kill thousands of exotic wild animals in Africa, this combined with poaching poses a serious threat to the survival of our most loved and endangered species. We have to stop this now. Animals are also bred in captivity for the sole purpose of being hunted by tourists who are willing to pay the high price tag, a lion hunt can cost a trophy hunter up to $35'000.We need to raise awareness around this issue. Please share and save our wildlife.This video does not show a real incident. In addition to some problems with the optics — the lion makes its way from the horizon to the camera at an alarmingly fast (and quiet) rate — this footage used an image of a lion that was killed in 2013, not 2016 as claimed in the YouTube message:On 28 April 2013, a series of images showing the result of a lion hunt in South Africa were posted to the web site Hunting Grounds. While a story accompanying the photographs provided some information about the hunt, there was no mention of the hunters being attacked by a lion:Wow. I do not really know where to begin in this story of how I got the massive Lion. Let us back up to January of 2013 to when it all started...The next encounter was the same but he walked out of the thicks and saw him at about 100 yards. This lion was HUGE! larger than what everyone thought when they took the original photo. I got him in my scope but he was trotting away from us and I didn't shoot. Then the lion ran like hell knowing he was being hunted. We spent another hour tracking him down and didn't see him. I felt discouraged.We kept on going on the tracks. The bushmen were amazing trackers, nothing like you would see anywhere. Well, not expecting anything to happen as it was getting really hot and only a couple hours left until sunset the bushmen stopped and the whole team stopped very quickly. Ahead of us was the lion in the bushes...about 7 yards in front of us. We could see that he was pissed and crouched down. He was moving his body around and either he was going to run away or run at us. So, I got him in my sites and BOOM! Nailed him in the spine and got one lung. Lucky shot it was. If I would have missed or even got a true lung/vital shot he would have ran at us or ran away while dying and the other PH's would have shot him for our protection because I would not have had time to reload.The lion was down and was not moving. He was dying slowly from the shot. So to end his life quicker I finished him off with another shot."	false

3058	Derek Chauvin, convicted of the murder of George Floyd, was a police training officer. Kim Potter, charged with second-degree manslaughter of Daunte Wright, was also a police training officer and president of her police union.	"On April 20, 2021, after a jury convicted former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin of murdering George Floyd, tweets spread about his work history, as well as that of Kim Potter, a former police officer charged in the death of another Black man, Daunte Wright.One such tweet claimed that both former police officers had also been training other police officers, and Potter was the president of her police union.According to a Marshall Project report, Chauvin was indeed responsible for training other police officers. In fact, his pupils watched as he knelt on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. In a June 2020 court appearance, Earl Gray, an attorney for Thomas Lane — one of the other police officers charged with aiding and abetting Floyd’s murder and manslaughter — argued that Lane was merely doing what his training officer told him to do.Gray argued that Lane had been on the job four days before the murder of Floyd, and described how Lane held down Floyd's legs so he wouldn't kick, and twice asked Chauvin, his training officer, if they should turn Floyd over.""What is my client supposed to do but follow what the training officer said?"" Gray said.Lane and the other officers involved in Floyd's arrest are currently charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. They will jointly face trial in August 2021. Kim Potter, also a former Minneapolis police officer, was in the midst of a routine training day when she shot and killed Daunte Wright during a traffic stop. Potter had 26 years of experience on the force. That day, she had been assigned to train and guide less experienced officers, according to a spokesperson for her police union.According to the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, Potter had been the president of her local police union in August 2019 when police officers shot and killed 21-year-old Kobe Dimock-Heisler. According to The Associated Press, she had only just become president that year. We covered Potter’s background in more detail here.Potter is currently charged with second-degree manslaughter and appeared in court just a few days before Chauvin was convicted.

In the spring of 2020, as debate raged over the timeliness and effectiveness of U.S. President Donald Trump's response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, some critics pointed to an article dating from shortly before Trump's January 2017 inauguration, in which Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), seemingly warned that the incoming president would ""no doubt"" be faced with a ""surprise infectious disease outbreak"":This image did reflect a genuine article, published on Jan. 11, 2017 (nine days before Trump's inauguration), headlined ""Fauci: ‘No doubt’ Trump will face surprise infectious disease outbreak."" That article read (in part):Anthony S. Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said there is “no doubt” Donald J. Trump will be confronted with a surprise infectious disease outbreak during his presidency.Fauci has led the NIAID for more than 3 decades, advising the past five United States presidents on global health threats from the early days of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s through to the current Zika virus outbreak.During a forum on pandemic preparedness at Georgetown University, Fauci said the Trump administration will not only be challenged by ongoing global health threats such as influenza and HIV, but also a surprise disease outbreak.“The history of the last 32 years that I have been the director of the NIAID will tell the next administration that there is no doubt they will be faced with the challenges their predecessors were faced with,” he said.As noted above, Dr. Fauci's comments were made during a Georgetown University forum on pandemic preparedness, at which Fauci delivered the keynote address on the subject of ""Pandemic Preparedness in the Next Administration,"" which he opened with the following statement:""I thought I would bring that perspective [of my experience in five administrations] to the topic today, [which] is the issue of pandemic preparedness. And if there's one message that I want to leave with you today based on my experience ... [it] is that there is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming [Trump] administration in the arena of infectious diseases ... both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease ... but also there will be a surprise outbreak, and I hope by the end my relatively short presentation you will understand why history, the history of the last 32 years that I've been the director of the NAIAD, will tell the next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with.""https://youtu.be/DNXGAxGJgQI
 Dr. Fauci did not literally warn in January 2017 that the Trump administration would certainly face a deadly pandemic affecting the U.S., but he said more generally (while speaking on the subject of pandemic preparedness) there was ""no question"" that a ""surprise outbreak"" of infectious disease would occur. The outgoing (Obama) administration had already faced multiple such events, including the 2009 swine flu (H1N1) pandemic, the 2015–2016 Zika virus epidemic, and the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa:Fauci and others noted some of the disease outbreaks that recent administrations have faced, including current President Barack Obama, whose administration was tested early on with an H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. More recently, the administration was forced to repurpose almost $600 million in federal funds set aside for the Ebola outbreak when Republicans rejected Obama’s request for $1.9 billion to fund the nation’s Zika response."	true
4113	The U.S. Postal Service is telling voters to send mail-in ballots 14 days before the Nov. 3, 2020, general election.	In late July 2020, Snopes readers asked for verification of claims made in viral social media posts that stated the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is advising the public that those who plan to cast a mail-in ballot in the Nov. 3, 2020, general election should get ballots in the mail 14 days in advance. Above is a screenshot of the post being widely shared.It's true that USPS is recommending voters who plan to vote by mail get their ballots in transit well before Election Day, but voters have a bit more time to do so than the above post suggests.In a statement, the USPS noted that voters should request ballots no less than 15 days in advance, and notes that most voters can mail them a week in advance of Election Day.Below is a statement sent to us by the Post Office, with the relevant portions in bold:The United States Postal Service is fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process when public policy makers choose to utilize us as a part of their election system, and to delivering Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards. We do ask election officials and voters to be mindful of the time that it takes for us to transport, process and deliver ballots from the election mail officials to the voters, the time that it takes for voters to consider and prepare their ballots, and the time that it takes for a ballot to be transported, processed, and delivered back to the election official after it is placed by the voter back into the mail stream, based upon our usual delivery standards which have not changed.For that reason, we recommend that customers who opt to vote through the U.S. Mail must understand their local jurisdiction’s requirements for timely submission of absentee ballots, including postmarking requirements. Voters must use First-Class Mail or an expedited level of service to return their completed ballots. In order to allow sufficient time for voters to receive, complete and return ballots via the mail, and to facilitate timely receipt of completed ballots by election officials, we strongly recommend that jurisdictions immediately communicate and advise voters to request ballots at the earliest point allowable but no later than 15 days prior to the election date. The Postal Service recommends that domestic, non-military voters mail their completed ballots back to the election officials at least one week prior to their state’s due date. The Postal Service also recommends that voters contact local election officials for information about deadlines.It's important that voters are aware of the rules that govern deadlines in their jurisdictions. As Washington, D.C.'s, news station WUSA9 reports:Now the note about deadlines is important. States have different rules for when mail-in ballots need to be received in order for them to count. Vote.org shows some states set their deadlines for election day, while other states say a mail-in ballot must be postmarked by election day and received within a few days of election day.	false
1850	Sec. of State Hillary Clinton's approval of a deal to transfer control of 20% of U.S. uranium deposits to a Russian company was a quid pro quo exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation.	"In the months leading up to the 2016 United States presidential election, stories abounded about the relationships between the Clinton Foundation and various foreign entities.May 2015 saw the publication of a book called Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, an exposé of alleged Clinton Foundation corruption written by Peter Schweizer, a former Hoover Institution fellow and editor-at-large at the right-wing media company Breitbart.A chapter in the book suggests that the Clinton family and Russia each may have benefited from a ""pay-for-play"" scheme while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, involving the transfer of U.S. uranium reserves to the new Russian owners of an international mining operation in exchange for $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation.The mining company, Uranium One, was originally based in South Africa, but merged in 2007 with Canada-based UrAsia Energy. Shareholders there retained a controlling interest until 2010, when Russia's nuclear agency, Rosatom, completed purchase of a 51% stake. Hillary Clinton played a part in the transaction insofar as it involved the transfer of ownership of a material deemed important to national security — uranium, amounting to one-fifth of U.S. reserves (a fraction re-estimated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) at closer to one-tenth of the United States' uranium production capacity in 2017) — thus requiring the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), on which the U.S. Secretary of State sits.During the same time frame that the acquisition took place, the Clinton Foundation accepted contributions from nine individuals associated with Uranium One totaling more than $100 million, Schweizer claimed in Clinton Cash. Among those who followed Schweizer in citing the transaction as an instance of alleged Clinton corruption was GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who said during a June 2016 speech in New York City:Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.Trump's campaign repeated the allegation in a September 2016 press release, and again in an October 2016 television ad stating that Clinton ""gave American uranium rights to the Russians"":An image circulating via social media during the final months of the presidential campaign asked the question, ""So Hillary, if Russia is such a threat, why did you sell them 20% of our uranium? Are you a liar, or a traitor, or both?""The Uranium One Deal Was Not Clinton's to Veto or Approve
 
Among the ways these accusations stray from the facts is in attributing a power of veto or approval to Secretary Clinton that she simply did not have. Clinton was one of nine cabinet members and department heads that sit on the CFIUS, and the secretary of the treasury is its chairperson. CFIUS members are collectively charged with evaluating proposed foreign acquisitions for potential national security issues, then turning their findings over to the president. By law, the committee can't veto a transaction; only the president can. All nine federal agencies were required to approve the Uranium One transaction before it could go forward. According to The New York Times, Clinton may not have even directly participated in the decision. Then-Assistant Secretary of State Jose Fernandez, whose job it was to represent the State Dept. on CFIUS, said Clinton ""never intervened"" in committee matters. Clinton herself has said she wasn't personally involved.There Is No Evidence That Uranium Went to RussiaThat a change of company ownership occurred doesn't mean that 10 to 20 percent of America's uranium literally went to Russia. Neither Uranium One nor ARMZ (Rosatom's mining subsidiary) is licensed to export uranium from the U.S. to other countries.Some exports did occur, however.A 2015 letter from NRC official Mark Satorius to a member of Congress revealed that an unspecified amount of yellowcake (semi-processed) uranium was shipped from a Uranium One facility in Wyoming to Canada between 2012 and 2014 for conversion (additional processing to prepare it for enrichment). A portion of that uranium was subsequently shipped to enrichment plants in Europe.The transfers to Canada were legal despite Uranium One's not holding an export license because the NRC granted such a license to the company that transported it. The transfers to Europe were legal because they were approved by another agency, the U.S. Dept. of Energy. Satorius stressed that the transfers were subject to NRC oversight and all applicable safety and national security regulations:Before issuing this license amendment to RSB Logistics Services — or any other export license or license amendment — the NRC must determine that the proposed export is not inimical to the common defense and security of the United States. Under existing NRC regulations, this means that any uranium proposed to be exported to any country for use in nuclear fuel would be subject to the Atomic Energy Act Section 123 agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the U.S. and that other country and confirmed in case-specific, government-to government assurances for each export license. The receiving country is required to commit to use the material only for peaceful purposes (not for development of any nuclear explosive device), to maintain adequate physical protection, and not to retransfer the material to a third country or alter it in form or content without the prior consent of the U.S. The transfer of the U.S.-supplied uranium from Canada to Europe noted above also was subject to applicable Section 123 agreements.Additionally, a small amount of that exported uranium was, in fact, sold to other countries. According to a 2 November 2017 article in The Hill, Uranium One officials acknowledged that approximately 25 percent of the yellowcake exported for conversion was subsequently sold via ""book transfer"" to customers in Western Europe and Asia (yellowcake being a fungible commodity, that doesn't necessarily translate to a physical transfer of the product, however).To date, there is no evidence that any of this uranium made its way to Russia. An NRC spokesman cited by FactCheck.org in October 2017 reaffirmed Satorius's assurances that ""the U.S. government has not authorized any country to re-transfer U.S. uranium to Russia."" NRC officials also say they're unaware of any Uranium One exports from the U.S. to foreign countries since 2014.The Timing of Most of the Clinton Foundation Donations Does Not Match
 
Of the $145 million allegedly contributed to the Clinton Foundation by Uranium One investors, the lion's share — $131.3 million — came from a single donor, Frank Giustra, the company's Canadian founder. But Giustra sold off his entire stake in the company in 2007, three years before the Russia deal and at least 18 months before Clinton became secretary of state. Of the remaining individuals connected with Uranium One who donated to the Clinton Foundation, only one was found to have contributed during the same time frame that the deal was taking place, according to The New York Times — Ian Telfer (also a Canadian), the company's chairman:His donations through the Fernwood Foundation included $1 million reported in 2009, the year his company appealed to the American Embassy to help it keep its mines in Kazakhstan; $250,000 in 2010, the year the Russians sought majority control; as well as $600,000 in 2011 and $500,000 in 2012. Mr. Telfer said that his donations had nothing to do with his business dealings, and that he had never discussed Uranium One with Mr. or Mrs. Clinton. He said he had given the money because he wanted to support Mr. Giustra's charitable endeavors with Mr. Clinton. ""Frank and I have been friends and business partners for almost 20 years,"" he said. In addition to the Clinton Foundation donations, the New York Times also cited a $500,000 speaking fee paid to former president Bill Clinton by a Russian investment bank in June 2010, before the Uranium One deal was approved:The $500,000 fee — among Mr. Clinton's highest — was paid by Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin that has invited world leaders, including Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, to speak at its investor conferences.Renaissance Capital analysts talked up Uranium One's stock, assigning it a ""buy"" rating and saying in a July 2010 research report that it was ""the best play"" in the uranium markets.The timing of Telfer’s Clinton Foundation donations and Bill Clinton's Renaissance Capital speaking fee might be questionable if there was reason to believe that Hillary Clinton was instrumental in the approval of the deal with Russia, but all the evidence points to the contrary — that Clinton did not play a pivotal role, and, in fact, may not have played any role at all. Moreover, neither Clinton nor her department possessed sole power of approval over said transaction.Foundation Admits to Disclosure Mistakes
 
One fault investigations into the Clinton Foundation's practices did find was that not all of the donations were properly disclosed — specifically, those of Uranium One Chairman Ian Telfer between 2009 and 2012. The foundation admitted this shortcoming and pledged to correct it, but as the Guardian pointed out in its May 2015 discussion of Clinton Cash, the fact that it happened is reason enough to sound alarm bells:It is also true that large donations to the foundation from the chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, at around the time of the Russian purchase of the company and while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, were never disclosed to the public. The multimillion sums were channeled through a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation, CGSCI, which did not reveal its individual donors.Such awkward collisions between Bill’s fundraising activities and Hillary’s public service have raised concerns not just among those who might be dismissed as part of a vast right-wing conspiracy.An enormous volume of interest and speculation surrounds the workings of the Clinton Foundation, which is to be expected. Given the enormous sums of money it controls and the fact that it is run by a former U.S. president who is married to a former U.S. secretary of state and presidential candidate, the foundation deserves all the scrutiny it gets, and more.At the same time, for the sake of accuracy it's crucial to differentiate between partisan accusations and what we actually know about it — however little that may be.UpdateOn 17 October 2017, The Hill reported obtaining evidence that Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official who oversaw the American operations of the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom, was being investigated for corruption by multiple U.S. agencies while the Uranium One deal was up for approval — information that apparently was not shared with U.S. officials involved in approving the transaction. The Hill also reported receiving documents and eyewitness testimony ""indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow,"" although no specifics about who those Russian nuclear officials were or how the money was allegedly routed to the Clinton Foundation were given. In any case, none of these revelations prove that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton participated in a quid pro quo agreement to accept payment for approval of the Uranium One deal."	false
4849	"Monica Lewinsky offered to ""take one for (the) team"" and perform oral sex in order to get President Donald Trump impeached."	"On Oct. 3, 2019, an image supposedly showing a tweet from Monica Lewinsky saying she was willing to ""take one for (the) team"" (and perform oral sex) in order to get U.S. President Donald Trump impeached started to circulate on social media:This is not a genuine tweet from Lewinsky. Lewinsky is the former White House intern at the center of the impeachment investigation into U.S. President Bill Clinton after the two had sexual relations in the oval office. While Clinton would eventually be impeached on charges such as ""making false and misleading statements to potential grand jury witnesses,"" this fake tweet is commenting on a bluntly (and incorrectly) boiled-down version of Clinton's impeachment.This tweet does not appear on Lewinsky's official Twitter timeline.

5853	A photograph shows a hearse being towed away in the middle of a funeral procession.	"A photograph purportedly showing a hearse being towed as a group of pallbearers carry a casket out of a church has been passed around as real on the Internet for several years:This image does not depict a genuine, real-world moment when a group of mourners realized that they would be walking to the grave site, but instead an onlooker's view of actors filming a scene for a television show. One giveaway is that a boom mic can be spotted just above the casket on the left side of the image. This piece of audio equipment is regularly used on television sets, but would be an oddity at a real funeral procession:In early 2010, Big Talk Productions was filming a scene for the show Rev. outside a church on Shoreditch High Street in London which involved a hearse being towed away during a funeral. As the actors began their faux funeral procession, a group of onlookers gathered to take videos and photographs of what they believed to be a truly grim situation.Peter Cattaneo, the show's director, told the Telegraph:Filming took place in and around the church of St Leonard’s in Shoreditch, east London. One afternoon, the crew shot a scene in which a hearse was towed away by wheel clampers. ‘Before long, a crowd had gathered and was getting really furious about it,’ recalls the show’s director, Peter Cattaneo (who also directed The Full Monty). ‘I said to one of them, “It’s a joke.” And they said, “It’s still disgusting!”‘I think it was [made worse] because the word “Nan” was in the hearse’s window,’ he adds.The scene comes from the third episode of the first season of Rev., and it can be briefly glimpsed in a featurette about the making of the show. Actor Tom Hollander can be seen approaching the hearse at the 55-second mark of the following video:
An unofficial copy of the scene can be found on YouTube. Another image of Hollander with the hearse can be seen below:"	false
1931	"Barack Obama urged his supporters to join him in changing ""the greatest nation in the history of the world."""	"The quote cited below sounds like the kind of verbal slip-up that occasionally escapes from the lips of politicians and other public figures: An idea that seems reasonable in thought (i.e., just because something is the best or greatest doesn't mean it can't be further improved) comes out expressed in wording that, when taken literally, can be interpreted as meaning just the opposite of what the speaker intended to say.
[Collected via e-mail, March  2008]Is this true?""My friends, we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world.
I hope you'll join with me as we try to change it."" -- Barack Obama
This phrase about changing ""the greatest nation in the history of the world"" wasn't uttered by Barack Obama, however, or by any other candidate.  It was a political in-joke poking a little fun at Hillary Clinton and John McCain (and politicians in general) which was posted to the National Review Online (NRO) blog ""The Corner"" by Mark Steyn on 28 January 2008:
Three weeks ago, after New Hampshire, when Hill and McCain and the gang were all bragging about being ""agents of change,"" a (non-U.S.) correspondent of mine e-mailed me his all-purpose stump speech for this primary season:
My friends, we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world. I hope you'll join with me as we try to change it.
Perhaps because ""change"" (as in ""Yes, we can change"") was one of the predominant themes of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, and perhaps because Steyn's blog post was entitled ""Barracking Barack,"" within a few weeks the ""I hope you'll join with me as we try to change it"" was being mooted on the Internet as something actually said by the Democratic candidate. In his syndicated column of June 7, 2008, Steyn mentioned the erroneous attribution of the quote to Barack Obama and expressed incredulity that reporters were actually taking it seriously:
As for coming together ""to remake this great nation,"" if it's so great, why do we have to remake it? A few months back, just after the New Hampshire primary, a Canadian reader of mine -- John Gross of Quebec -- sent me an all-purpose stump speech for the 2008 campaign:""My friends, we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world. I hope you'll join with me as we try to change it.""I thought this was so cute, I posted it on the Web at National Review. Whereupon one of those Internetty-type things happened, and three links and a Google search later the line was being attributed not to my correspondent but to Sen. Obama, and a few weeks after that I started getting e-mails from reporters from Florida to Oregon, asking if I could recall at which campaign stop the senator, in fact, uttered these words. And I'd patiently write back and explain that they're John Gross' words, and that not even Barack would be dumb enough to say such a thing in public.
In February 2012, some newspapers (including the San Jose Mercury News) announced they were dropping the Decodaquote puzzle feature from their pages after one of its cryptograms encoded the above-referenced quote and attributed it to Barack Obama."	false
3090	Mick Jagger can be viewed as a COVID-19 lockdown skeptic/critic based on the lyrics in his latest song “Easy Sleazy” with Dave Grohl released in April 2021.	"Mick Jagger, the famed rockstar and lead singer for the Rolling Stones, had some time in lockdown to write new music, as he released a song with Dave Grohl in April 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic.The lyrics of the song “Easy Sleazy” complain about being under lockdown restrictions due to the deadly virus:We took it on the chin
The numbers were so grim
Bossed around by pricks
Stiffen upper lips, yeah
Pacing in the yard
You're trying to take the Mick
You must think I’m really thick
Looking at the graphs with a magnifying glass
Cancel all the tours, football's fake applause, yeah
No more travel brochures
Virtual premieres
I've got nothing left to wearA website called Lockdown Sceptics, which styles itself as a space to critique the British government’s lockdown strategies, claimed these lyrics meant Jagger was a critic of such restrictions. The website also publishes anti-vaccination commentary.But Jagger has never indicated he is personally a skeptic of the necessity of lockdowns. Indeed, he even appeared in a comedic campaign for Save the Children, showing how one can be productive even while quarantined at home. See below:The remaining lyrics of his song appear to mock conspiracy theorists, including those who are anti-vaccination:Shooting the vaccine
Bill Gates is in my bloodstream
It's mind control
The earth is flat and cold
It's never warming up
The arctic's turned to slush
The second coming's late
And there's aliens in the deep stateOther lyrics seem to look forward to the lifting of lockdown restrictions:Now we're out of these prison walls
You gotta pay Peter if you're robbing Paul
But it's easy, easy
Everything's gonna be really freaky
Alright on the night
We're all headed back to paradise
Yeah, easy, believe me
It'll be a memory you're trying to remember to forgetJagger has also seemingly been complying with lockdown regulations. The 77-year-old spoke to the BBC about life in lockdown and its impact on mental health, and he described how he felt ""lucky"" during the experience: ""I can feel that people could get really quite depressed about the whole thing because there was a point where there was no light at the end of the tunnel. It was sometimes a little bit down for a lot of people, but I was lucky enough to avoid most of that."" He has described ""Easy Sleazy"" as a ""sardonic and humorous"" take on coming out of life under lockdown, and a reflection on the year, as well as the fight against misinformation.Jagger said he had been ""very lucky that I had a couple of places and ... a nice garden [...] I don't have the problems of living, say, in a small flat in London or New York, which some of my friends have had,"" he told the BBC. ""Two kids in a two room flat in Manhattan? I honestly don't know how I would have done that. Maybe a couple of weeks. But for that long, I don't know how I would have done it. And I admire them for being able to do it.""You can listen to the full song here:"	false

-->In both cases the claims were erroneous, an expression of the mistaken belief the use of some simple legal talisman — knowing enough to ask the right question or post a pertinent disclaimer — will immunize one from some undesirable legal consequence. The law just doesn't work that way.First off, the ""problem"" this ineffective solution supposedly addresses is a non-existent one: Facebook isn't claiming copyright to the personal information, photographs, and other material that their users are posting to the social network, nor have they announced any plans that would make all Facebook posts public (even previously deleted ones) regardless of a user's privacy settings):In response to rumors about copyright issues that began circulating in November 2012 after Facebook announced they were considering revoking users' rights to vote on proposed policy changes, the company issued a statement noting that:There is a rumor circulating that Facebook is making a change related to ownership of users' information or the content they post to the site. This is false. Anyone who uses Facebook owns and controls the content and information they post, as stated in our terms. They control how that content and information is shared. That is our policy, and it always has been. Click here to learn more: www.facebook.com/policies.Similarly, ABC News reported:[Users worried that] Facebook will own their photos or other media are posting [a frightful message] — unaware that it is a hoax. Here's the truth: Facebook doesn't own your media.""We have noticed some statements that suggest otherwise and we wanted to take a moment to remind you of the facts — when you post things like photos to Facebook, we do not own them,"" Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said in a statement. ""Under our terms you grant Facebook permission to use, distribute, and share the things you post, subject to the terms and applicable privacy settings.""Brad Shear, a Washington-area attorney and blogger who is an expert on social media, said the message [that Facebook users are posting to their walls is] ""misleading and not true."" He said that when you agree to Facebook's terms of use you provide Facebook a ""non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any content you post. You do not need to make any declarations about copyright issues since the law already protects you. The privacy declaration [in this message] is worthless and does not mean anything.""In any case, Facebook users cannot retroactively negate any of the privacy or copyright terms they agreed to when they signed up for their accounts, nor can they unilaterally alter or contradict any new privacy or copyright terms instituted by Facebook, simply by posting a contrary legal notice on their Facebook walls. Moreover, the fact that Facebook is now a publicly traded company (i.e., a company that has issued stocks which are traded on the open market) or an ""open capital entity"" has nothing to do with copyright protection or privacy rights. Any copyright or privacy agreements users of Facebook have entered into with that company prior to its becoming a publicly traded company or changing its policies remain in effect: they are neither diminished nor enhanced by Facebook's public status.Before you can use Facebook, you must indicate your acceptance of that social network's legal terms, which includes its privacy policy and its terms and policies. You can neither alter your acceptance of that agreement nor restrict the rights of entities who are not parties to that agreement simply by posting a notice to your Facebook account, citing the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), or referencing the Berne Convention. (One of the common legal talismans referenced above is UCC Section 1-308, which has long been popular among conspiracy buffs who incorrectly maintain that citing it above your signature on an instrument will confer upon you the ability to invoke extraordinary legal rights.)If you do not agree with Facebook's stated policies, you have several options:(Note that in the last case, you may have already ceded some rights which you cannot necessarily reclaim by canceling your account.)As techtalk noted of Facebook users' current privacy rights:The fact is that Facebook members own the intellectual property (IP) that is uploaded to the social network, but depending on their privacy and applications settings, users grant the social network ""a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License).""Facebook adds, ""[t]his IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.""While the social network does not technically own its members content, it has the right to use anything that is not protected with Facebook's privacy and applications settings. For instance, photos, videos and status updates set to public are fair game.A variation on this meme related to Snapchat photos, which was similarly false, went viral in summer 2019. "	false
1608	Teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg is actually an Australian actress named Estella Renee.	"As teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg found herself in the global spotlight in September 2019, climate-change deniers sought to discredit her with a series of false rumors and doctored photographs. Perhaps the most preposterous of these claims was that Thunberg was actually an Australian actress named Estella Renee who was delivering speeches on environmental issues not because she was concerned about the planet, but because she was a deep state crisis actor and paid to shill. While researching this article we found at least three variations of the ""Greta Thunberg is an actress"" claim. They are as follows:We'll take a deeper look at each of these items individually. Greta Thunberg is actually Australian actress Estelle Renee?Several social media users have claimed that Thunberg is actually an Australian actress named Estelle Renee. Facebook user Jack A. Schulman, for instance, wrote:Aspiring Actress impersonates crying child climate activist at UN, impersonator is a sham. Screams ""How dare you!"" from acting class.Estella Renee is a very talented shakespearian actress from Australia. She can do Scandinavian accents. She can break down and cry. She can scream ""How dare you!"". She deserves an Academy Award not a Nobel for impersonating Heidi looking Greta Thunberg, a fictional Character before the UN yesterday, a fake climate activist, a child actor age 15 and 1/2 screaming ""How dare you!"" straight out of "" Streetcar named Desire! "".Otherwise, she's a sham and a fraud! Her publicist refused to respond to our calls, but NY customs identified her as Estrella Renee, here ""to see the sights"" at her entry from Australia. Her adult accompaniment signed her into her hotel room as Greta Thungren, but we confirmed she is Estelle Renee. We turned over her illegal false identity to DHS who has confirmed her dual identity, but is still investigating. They are not sure impersonation is a crime.Yet, what a fraud!!This claim is nonsensical. Thunberg didn't appear out of thin air in September 2019 to deliver a speech to the United Nations. She's been on the public radar since at least September 2018 when she started staging climate protests in Sweden. Thunberg has also been nominated for numerous awards (including the Nobel Peace Prize), has met with several world leaders, and took a highly publicized voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, we know the identity of Thunberg's parents, Svante Thunberg and Malena Ernman, as well as her grandfather, Olof Thunberg, and her sister, Beata. In other words, Greta Thunberg is not a ""fictional character."" Her journey to becoming a global environmental activist has been well documented. Greta Thunberg has an IMDB page. Is this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous?A slightly less far-fetched version of this claim holds that Thunberg is listed as an ""actress"" on her IMDB page. While this is true, many have shared this screenshot as if it was somehow damaging to Thunberg's reputation as an environmental activist:Thunberg has one acting credit to her name. She lent her voice to a short film titled ""Ave Paraíso"" that was released in Spain in 2019. The remainder of her IMDB page simply lists appearances she's made on television programs (such as ""The Daily Show"") or in environmental documentaries where she is credited as herself. The fact that Thunberg has an IMDB page is often shared along with the insinuation that her environmental beliefs are not sincere. However, it should be noted that being an actor does not automatically disqualify someone from having an opinion, being an activist, or having a political career. Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio, for instance, often lends his voice to environmental causes. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronald Reagan were both actors before embarking on political careers. Even U.S. President Donald Trump is listed as an ""actor"" on his IMDB page:  The website Michael Smith News noted one additional detail about Thunberg's IMDB page that seemingly hinted at the notion that she was a paid actress looking for new gigs. The website wrote that ""you can talk to her agent if you'd like to book her for acting work"" and then linked to an IMDB Pro link. However, it doesn't appear that Michael Smith News has access to IMDB Pro. When we checked Greta's listing on IMDB Pro, we found no listing for Thunberg's alleged agent.Does the viral video of a young climate protester crying feature actress Estelle Renee?Thunberg wasn't the only environmental activist to be accused of being an actor. The websites TeaParty.org, The Gateway Pundit, Joe for America, and the aforementioned Michael Smith News all published articles about how it was ""all a hoax"" and that the ""little girl seen crying in viral video"" at the Global Warming rally was really a child actress, ""a prop for the left,"" named Estelle Renee:The international left used innocent children last weekend to push their climate change extremism.Tens of thousands of children were let out of school so they could go protest against capitalism and global warming.As we reported on Monday — One terrified little girl in Australia couldn’t even talk to reporters about climate change without crying......But that was not your typical emotional teen. The girl in the video is an Aussie child actress."	false
1746	A new study published in the Lancet has officially declared that fluoride is a neurotoxin.	"Since at least December 2015, several effectively identical stories about the neurotoxicity of fluoride have been published on a wide variety of websites with domain names like AltHealthworks.com, Energytherapy.biz, Organic and Healthy.org, and most recently in a 5 April 2018 post from AwarenessAct.com:Evidence of how negatively fluoride can impact our health has been increasing in rapid pace throughout the past few years. People are hoping that by bringing awareness to this that somehow we can get sodium fluoride removed from the world’s water supply.A big step has been made here recently. In the most prestigious medical journal [...] known as The Lancet [,] fluoride has been at last classified as a neurotoxin one hundred percent. This puts it in the same category as things like lead, arsenic, and mercury. This news was released by the author Stefan Smyle who actually cited a report that had been published in The Lancet Neurology, Volume 13, Issue 3 [...] in the March of 2014 edition.Right off the bat, there are a number of elements that should jump out at the reader as dubious. First, studies — even ones published in prestigious journals — do not themselves ""declare"" or ""classify"" anything as a neurotoxin; governmental organizations, using published research and other data, make determinations about a chemical’s danger and regulate it accordingly.In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of chemicals approved as non-toxic under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and they regulate standards for levels of human-made and natural contaminants in water under the Safe Drinking Water Act. For food or cosmetic products, the Food and Drug Administration makes similar determinations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.Second, the concept of classifying something as “one hundred percent” neurotoxic betrays the original author’s ignorance of the concept of toxicity. Toxicologists do not refer to toxicity in any way that could be represented as a percentage, instead they develop exposure guidelines and reference doses. The dose, as they say, makes the poison, and many things that are legally allowed to be in food are, in fact, neurotoxic at high enough doses.For these reasons, the viral claim can be debunked as false without even getting into the Lancet Neurology paper cited in these stories. However, since that paper continues to be attached to these viral click traps, it is worth noting that the study itself included no new analyses about the neurotoxicity of fluoride.The Lancet Neurology PaperThough presented as a large-scale study revealing new toxicologic information about fluoride, this paper (which was in Lancet Neurology, not The Lancet) introduced no new data on fluoride neurotoxicity. It instead makes a broader argument that all chemicals should be considered neurotoxic to children given science’s inability to accurately or effectively assess neurotoxicity to developing brains, citing past research on fluoride as one example of a potentially harmful chemical:To control the pandemic of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose a global prevention strategy. Untested chemicals should not be presumed to be safe to brain development, and chemicals in existing use and all new chemicals must therefore be tested for developmental neurotoxicity.The paper itself drew fierce criticism from scientists in both industry and academia when it was first published, and Lancet Neurology ended up publishing an unusually large of number of professional responses to the study. Authored by Harvard School of Public Health professor Philippe Grandjean and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Professor Philip J. Landrigan, this 2014 paper is a follow up an earlier paper written by the same authors that incorporates new studies that had been conducted since then.The entirety of new information about fluoride in the 2014 iteration of their work boils down to a single new study — a meta-review of 27 smaller scale studies published in a 2012 paper which also included Grandjean as an author. It also drew significant academic backlash and media attention. The paper was so misrepresented by some media accounts hailing it as rock-solid evidence that water fluoridation reduces the intelligence of children that the authors actually had to append a clarification notice to the press release sent out by Harvard, stating their results could not be used to assess the levels at which fluoride could become neurotoxic:These results do not allow us to make any judgment regarding possible levels of risk at levels of exposure typical for water fluoridation in the U.S. On the other hand, neither can it be concluded that no risk is present. We therefore recommend further research to clarify what role fluoride exposure levels may play in possible adverse effects on brain development, so that future risk assessments can properly take into regard this possible hazard.The reason that this study can not be used to draw a direct comparison the United States or to water fluoridation programs in general is because most of the studies are from China and utilize the natural variations of fluoride in groundwater, which is found in high concentration in some regions there. In many cases, the studies analyzed in the 2012 review investigate extremely high concentrations of fluoride that far exceed legal limits in the United States.The Fluoride ArgumentFurther — and despite assurances by Grandjean and Landrigan to the contrary — many of the studies included in the 2012 review (which were translated from Chinese and republished in the journal Fluoride years after their original publication) do not provide  anywhere near enough information to defend the claim that their documented associations between exposure to fluoride and reduced IQ are ""unlikely"" to be driven by another chemical in drinking water (such as arsenic) that could also have a neurologic effect. For a more detailed look at the criticisms of that 2012 study, please see our post on claims that water fluoridation can reduce a person's intelligence quotient.A better study to reference if one were interested in providing an argument that fluoride could have cognitive effects on developing brains would be a 2017 paper published in Environmental Health Perspectives, which demonstrates an association between prenatal fluoride exposure and reduced IQ in mother-offspring pairs in Mexico. This study, like many in the review described above, is not great for comparisons to United States water fluoridation, however. That's because the  mother-offspring pairs in this 2017 study were exposed either to naturally occurring fluoride or through fluoride added to salt, not to water. It therefore cannot be used confidently to assess the levels at which fluoride in drinking water could be neurotoxic to developing brains:Our findings, combined with evidence from existing animal and human studies, reinforce the need for additional research on potential adverse effects of fluoride, particularly in pregnant women and children, and to ensure that the benefits of population-level fluoride supplementation outweigh any potential risks."	false
4295	"A Walmart store played audio supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and acknowledging the existence of ""white privilege."""	"In June 2020, amidst nationwide protests initially triggered by the police-custody death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in Minneapolis, a Facebook user posted a (subsequently deleted) account claiming that her local Walmart outlet in Grove, Oklahoma, was repeatedly playing a message over the store's loudspeaker stating that ""Walmart understands white privilege exists and supports Black Lives Matter"" and ""acknowledge[s] the injustices committed by law enforcement agencies"":This happened to Hanna brown in grove walmart posting so people can share the crap out of thisMy husband is a good man. My husband is not perfect. My husband makes mistakes. My husband is the type of person that would help anyone at any time. My husband is a police officer. Today I watched the light in my husband and my son's eyes leave. Today I had to defend one of the bravest men I have ever met.Let's back up a bit. Today is Sunday, June 14th, 2020. Our family went to church as we do every Sunday. After church, we ran to Walmart in Grove Oklahoma. This is not unusual for our family, in fact, this is almost always a weekly trip. Someone has forgotten something and we zip over to Walmart and pick up what we need.Today changed that for our family. We will never return to Grove Walmart or any other Walmart. While in the store a message repeatedly played over the loudspeaker. This message stated that Walmart understands white privilege exist and supports Black lives matter. It went on to say how they support the black community and acknowledge the injustices committed by the law enforcement agencies. I watched my nine-year-old son whip his head around and the light goes out in my husband's eyes. We decided to leave the store. My husband was just going to leave and not say anything to anyone. But I had to show my son that his father was a good man and that sometimes we have to stand up for what is right.I asked our check out person if she would please get a manager for us. She said why maybe I can help. I said no please just call a manager. She refused. She looked at my husband and asked him to tell her why I wanted a manager. My husband replied that the message on the speaker is directly against his line of work and that it was not friendly towards the police department. She responded with I am no longer comfortable speaking with you. He said that is fine but you asked what was wrong so I told you. She said I did ask but I no longer want to know. I said that it is fine could you please call the manager my husband and I would like to speak with the manager. He is a police officer and would like to address this issue. At this time she said that she would not serve us at all because he was a police officer and she just walked away. She left us with half of our order rang up. I looked at the lady behind me with tears in my eyes and she told my husband thank you for your service.Some other checkers came and finished the purchase. A few minutes later two male employees came up. The manager asked what happened. When we told him he said that she had the right to not serve anyone. My husband agreed with that. My husband told the manager that he didn't expect Walmart to back Blue lives but he did think of the very least for impartiality. The manager proceeded to tell us that corporate feel like there are more black people than law enforcement and that money is more important to the corporation than law enforcement and their families. He said this was Walmart's corporate policy.I asked the man so Walmart is not going to support law enforcement officers at all? His response was no not as long as they were making more money from the people in this movement. So this tells me that they only care about money.The manager said that people at corporate make the decisions and they have to play the message. Another officer came up and showed his badge asked about the broadcast and we told him about how we were treated and that Walmart corporation feels that law enforcement can be refused service just for being police officers his face registered utter shock.My son was devastated. We were treated like criminals. My husband was devastated. This is what These black lives matter and defund the police is causing. This is not okay.I am a proud LEO wife, I am proud of my husband. My husband may save that lady someday but still, she will hate him.But as the Grand Lake News (and others) reported, the referenced in-store audio recording was a message from Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon that acknowledged the ""intense sense of pain, fatigue and frustration"" being felt by ""our black and African American associates and communities."" It made no mention of Black Lives Matter or law enforcement or ""white privilege,"" nor did it specifically endorse any particular group or movement:Here’s a special message from Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon:Over the past few days I have personally heard from many of our associates, leaders and members of the Walmart community. Overwhelmingly, people are hurting. There is an intense sense of pain, fatigue and frustration. Let me say clearly to our black and African American associates and communities, we hear you, we see you, I want you to know you are valued. You are loved members of our family. We need you to know you are not hurting alone, that I and others are hurting with you.“So what now? Where do we go from here? Until we as a nation confront and address these hard realities, we’ll never achieve the best of what we can be. What does this mean for us, for Walmart? Words and feelings matter, but they are not enough. More action is required. We’ll find new ways to accelerated the desired changes inside our company and we’ll also find way that our business can influence real change in our country. To learn more about how we’re working to advance fairness, equity and justice, visit corporate.walmart.com/equity.Other Facebook users visited the same Walmart and recorded the audio being played in-store to verify its content, and posted material that cast doubt on several other aspects of the original claim:"	false
594	A video authentically shows Hillary Clinton endorsing Ron DeSantis for president.	"On April 11, 2023, a video began to spread on social media platforms that claimed 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, had endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, for president. ""You can tell a lot about a candidate by what opposition party leaders say about them…,"" Twitter account @Ramble_Rants posted. Attached was a video that claimed to show Clinton saying that she liked DeSantis to MSNBC:You know, people might be surprised to hear me say this. But I actually like Ron DeSantis a lot. I know. I'd say he's just the kind of guy this country needs, and I mean that. If Ron DeSantis got installed as president, I'd be fine with that. I mean, the one thing I'd say about Ron is that when push comes to shove, Ron does what he's told. And I can't think of anything more important than that. Hail Hydra. According to Know Your Meme, ""Hail Hydra"" is the catchphrase of a fictional terrorist organization in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Besides spreading on Twitter, the video has also been posted on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.In replies to the Twitter post, @Ramble_Rants said the video had been faked with the help of another user, @C3PMeme. That account's website also contained fake videos of U.S. President Joe Biden, among other public figures, as well as other fake MSNBC footage.Besides the account admitting it was a fake video, there were additional signs the video wasn't real. The fake video's identifier said ""Rumble Rants"" (the handle of the account that posted the video) under the MSNBC logo.

6135	"""The Simpsons"" predicted that there would be a mass shooting at a screening of the movie ""Black Panther."""	"Popular animated television show 'The Simpsons' has gained a reputation for ""predicting"" the future over the years. Although we'd probably classify these predictions as coincidences (and have repeatedly noted that many of these predictions were actually hoaxes or misrepresented in some way), some internet users have come to see the show as some sort of window into the future.So when rumors started circulating that the long-running show had predicted a mass shooting at a screening of the movie ""Black Panther,"" they were often accompanied by messages warning moviegoers to be careful or to even bring weapons to the theater:This is not a genuine screenshot from The Simpsons. For one, the geography in this still simply makes no logical sense. The bottom portion of the image features Ned Flanders looking down at a park. The image of the movie theater was shoehorned into this image, cutting off a bush and a field, in a way that simply isn't plausible, even for the cartoon town of Springfield. The image of Ned Flanders holding a sniper rifle did truly come from an episode of The Simpsons. However, Homer Simpson's neighbor was not targeting moviegoers outside a screening of the movie Black Panther. This clip comes from the episode ""Homer Loves Flanders,"" which aired during the show's 5th season in 1994, and featured Flanders fantasizing about killing Homer during a dream sequence:This clip appears to be referencing the movie The Deadly Tower which was based off a real-world shooting that took place in 1966 at the University of Texas:1966 University of Texas Shooting: When Flanders, during a dream sequence, begins to shoot citizens at random from the vantage point of a clock tower, he is mirroring the 1966 actions of real life mass shooter Charles Whitman.The Deadly Tower: It was also based on the events of the film The Deadly Tower, which was itself based on the event listed above.The movie theater portion of the viral image did not originate in The Simpsons. This is merely a piece of clipart that was cropped, distorted, and graffitied with the words ""Black Panther"":Black Panther earned rave reviews before its premiere on 16 February 2018 and was expected to set a few box office records. Some racist internet users seemed perturbed over the movie's projected success, however, in large part due to the nearly all black cast.As moviegoers lined up for tickets for the film, internet trolls also started posting violent pictures (from unrelated events) along with fictional stories about how they had been mugged or beaten up at one of the screenings. They urged moviegoers to stay away from the theater or, at the very least, to bring weapons so that they could defend themselves. Not only is this image purportedly showing Ned Flanders opening fire outside of a screening for Black Panther fake, it is also dangerous, stirring unfounded fears and calling for taking weapons to a movie theater."	false

In April 2020, a set of screenshots supposedly showing comments from a ""John McDaniels,"" in which he called COVID-19 a ""political ploy"" and social-distancing measures ""bullshit,"" started to circulate on social media. Along with the posts were articles claiming he died from complications of the coronavirus disease. Here's a screenshot supposedly showing a post from McDaniel on March 15 and a snippet from his obituary a month later:McDaniel truly died from complications related to COVID-19 in April 2020 after he downplayed the seriousness of the disease on social media. The New York Daily News wrote: An Ohio man has tragically died from COVID-19 after criticizing his state’s coronavirus lockdown.John W. McDaniel, 60, died Wednesday in Columbus, exactly one month after reportedly calling Gov. Mike DeWine’s stay-at-home order “madness.”“If what I’m hearing is true, that DeWine has ordered all bars and restaurants to be closed, I say bullshit! He doesn’t have the authority,"" McDaniel reportedly wrote in a since-deleted social media post circulated widely on social media.As screenshots of McDaniel's posts went viral, many social media users took the opportunity to criticize McDaniel, saying he had received his comeuppance for calling the virus a political ploy. McDaniel's wife, Lisa, acknowledged that her husband had made some ""early assumptions"" about the virus on social media, but added that social media users were also making unfair assumptions about him. In a statement posted to the Snyder Funeral Homes Facebook page that announced services for McDaniel would not be live-streamed due to concerns about unwanted, negative social media reactions, she explained that McDaniel, like many others, was initially not fully aware of the severity of the pandemic. However, she wrote that he ordered the employees at his company O&M to work from home on March 16 (the day after the above-displayed Facebook post). Furthermore, according to her Facebook message, he self-isolated as soon as he was made aware that he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.Lastly, she wrote that if he were still alive, he would have abided by the state's stay-at-home order and would have encouraged others to do the same. Here's her statement from April 22, 2020 (emphasis ours):Words do not describe all of the emotions we, John W. McDaniel's family, are experiencing right now. We are overwhelmed with grief for the loss of our believed husband, father, soon to be father-in-law, son, brother, uncle, and dear friend to many. Similar to thousands of people, we are suffering from an unexpected and untimely loss due to the effects of COVID-19, the likes of which we never could have imagined. During this time of mourning, John's story, along with early assumptions that he stated on Twitter and Facebook have turned into national news. The news has opened the flood gates for people to share their own misguided anger and unfounded assumptions about a man they don't know. Wanting to protect my family and John's legacy, we have decided not to live stream his funeral services via Facebook today. We will be privately recording his services today and we will be sharing it directly with his family and friends. We have not come to this decision lightly and we hope everyone will honor and respect this decision.  As each day passes, we all are learning more about this ""invisible enemy."" We have all learned that the early actions taken by our National and State government were indeed the right action to take. Quarantine and social distancing have been effective in flattening the curve. John, President of O&M, ordered the company to work from home on March 16. In addition, it is important to note that John immediately self-isolated as soon as he learned he had been in contact with someone who had tested positive. Many, like John, made statements early on not fully aware of the severity of COVID-19; many have retracted their statements knowing now the effects of this pandemic. We know if John was still here with us he would acknowledge the national crisis we're are in, abide by the stay-at-home order, and encourage family and friends to do the same. But sadly he is not with us and we will forever have to live and cope with how his life ended far too soon. Further, we will never be able to erase from our hears and minds the negative posts that have been made and shared about John this past week.To all of our family and friends, my sons and I will never be able to appropriately say ""thank you"" for all the love and support you have given us throughout this entire process. From the bottom of our hearts we will forever be grateful for you and the special relationship we share.While some may cast aspersions on McDaniel for not treating COVID-19 with the seriousness it deserved in March 2020, it should be noted that misinformation has been rampant during this pandemic."	true

5190	Actor Gene Hackman said Donald Trump 'could easily turn out to be one of the best presidents America has ever seen.'	"A June 2019 Facebook post offered a photograph of Gene Hackman along with a putative quote from actor proclaiming that ""Donald Trump could easily turn out to be one of the best presidents that America has ever seen"":Putting unlikely (particularly pro-Trump) statements in the mouths of celebrities became something of a cottage industry for fake news promulgators around the time of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and this item was one of that ilk. This quote did not originate with a genuine statement from the Academy Award-winning actor, but rather with a November 2018 article from the (no longer active) coolinfo24.com junk news site reporting on a supposed interview with Hackman:Not long ago Gene Hackman, while being interviewed stated something truly important about our leader.He initially described how he met the current president of the United States:Well I have met Donald Trump back in the 80’s, he was a guest at my party in New York.”“We discussed and he really seemed like a decent guy, in fact i liked him.”He also added that when he heard Donald Trump is going to be the Republican candidate for the election he was truly shocked.I didn’t believe it, but in fact I was happy because I knew that a successful businessman could get on the top of our nation.”Hackman also went ahead and stated something truly amazing in regards to Trump’s one year as president of the United States:“So what do i think about Trump now? It is possible he could turn out to the be one the best presidents that America has ever seen.”“His initial year is fascinating he made numerous of positive changes. Just keep on doing the same, Mr. President!”The coolinfo24.com article actually used a truncated version of a statement attributed to Sheffield-born entrepreneur and nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow, which the South Yorkshire Times reported on when Stringfellow passed away in June 2018.According to the Times, Stringfellow met Trump at a party thrown by Hackman in the 1980s, and when Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States in January 2017, Stringfellow offered the much more ambiguous statement that Trump could turn out to the be ""one of the best presidents that America has ever seen ... or one of the worst"":Writing shortly after [Trump's] inauguration as president in 2017, Stringfellow wrote: ""Yes -- I have met Donald Trump -- back in the 80s.""Gene Hackman threw a party at my club in New York, and Donald was a guest.""So what do I think about Trump?"	false
685	"In an effort to comply with Florida's new ""Stop W.O.K.E. Act"" law, the publisher of a Florida textbook submitted a draft revision that altered a section on Rosa Parks to remove any mention of her race or of racial segregation."	"The publisher says the changes provided to Florida officials were an overreaction to a vaguely written Florida law; the publisher has since re-written the section on Rosa Parks to include mention of her race in the most recent version of that lesson.On March 19, 2023, The New York Times reported on purported changes to a school lesson on Rosa Parks made by a publisher, Studies Weekly, when submitting its material to a Florida state review of educational materials: In an attempt to cater to Florida, at least one publisher made significant changes to its materials, walking back or omitting references to race, even in its telling of the Rosa Parks story.The publisher, Studies Weekly, mostly serves younger students, with a focus on science and social studies, and its curriculum — short lessons in weekly pamphlets — is used in 45,000 schools across the country, according to its website. Its social studies materials are used in Florida elementary schools today.The New York Times compared three versions of the company's Rosa Parks story, meant for first graders: a current lesson used now in Florida, an initial version created for the state textbook review and a second updated version.With the 2022 passage of the ""Stop W.O.K.E. Act,"" championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida state law prohibited instruction that would, as The New York Times described, ""compel students to feel responsibility, guilt or anguish for what other members of their race did in the past, among other limits."" Specifically, the law reads:It shall constitute discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex under this section to subject any student or employee to training or instruction that espouses, promotes, advances, inculcates, or compels such student or employee to believe …  a person, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of actions, in which the person played no part, committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, national origin, or sex. In Florida, educational materials must be approved at the state level, with different subjects undergoing a review each year. But the text of this law, critics have noted, is vague, and potentially makes it a violation of law to teach about historical events involving racial injustice. The New York Times reporting focused on examples of publishers changing material in an effort to satisfy this law. With respect to Rosa Parks, the Times analyzed three versions of the lessons. These included the version of the lesson currently approved (pre-2023 review), a version that was first submitted to Florida regulators for review (an initial version for review) and a re-worked version for that same review:In the current lesson on Rosa Parks, segregation is clearly explained: ""The law said African Americans had to give up their seats on the bus if a white person wanted to sit down."" But in the initial version created for the textbook review, race is mentioned indirectly. ""She was told to move to a different seat because of the color of her skin,"" the lesson said.In the initial version for the review, Ms. Parks was told to move because of ""the color of her skin."" In the updated version [submitted to the textbook review], race is not mentioned at all. ""She was told to move to a different seat,"" the lesson said, without an explanation of segregation.The changes made for the Florida review were first highlighted by the anti-censorship group Florida Freedom to Read in November 2022:In a news release, Studies Weekly confirmed that such a change was made for the review, but argued it was an internal mistake and an over-reaction:Because the Florida Department of Education provided no guidance on interpreting Florida House Bill 7, Studies Weekly, like every publisher, has had to decipher how to comply with their legislation. That being said, during the Florida social studies adoption, individuals in our curriculum team severely overreacted in their interpretation of HB 7 and made unapproved revisions. Typically, our quality assurance processes would have flagged and denied edit approval. Unfortunately, during the final hours before the deadline, they circumvented our established protocols in an attempt to submit their revisions on time. We have identified those individuals, taken corrective action, and implemented additional safeguards to avoid any issues in the future.The company said that the version sent for review will not enter any curricula, and the organization has added mention of race to the story. ""We find the omission or altering of historical facts to be abhorrent and do not defend it,"" the company added."	true
1357	An article accurately describes a talk given by the son of one of the men featured in the Iwo Jima statue to a group of Wisconsin schoolchildren at the Marine Corps Memorial.	"The below-quoted article was written in October 2000 by Wisconsin resident Michael T. Powers (whose name has been omitted from most of the Internet-circulated versions), transcribed from a videotape he made of a talk given by author James Bradley at the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia. Bradley, whose father, John, was one of the six men pictured in the famous photograph of the flag-raising on Mt. Suribachi in February 1945 (and is thus depicted in the monument's sculpture), had earlier that year published Flags of Our Fathers, an account of the life stories of those six men.Each year my video production company is hired to go to Washington, D.C. with the eighth grade class from Clinton, Wisconsin where I grew up, to videotape their trip. I greatly enjoy visiting our nation's capitol, and each year I take some special memories back with me. This fall's trip was especially memorable.On the last night of our trip, we stopped at the Iwo Jima memorial. This memorial is the largest bronze statue in the world and depicts one of the most famous photographs in history-that of the six brave men raising the American flag at the top of Mount Surabachi on the Island of Iwo Jima, Japan during WW II. Over one hundred students and chaperones piled off the buses and headed towards the memorial. I noticed a solitary figure at the base of the statue, and as I got closer he asked, ""What's your name and where are you guys from?I told him that my name was Michael Powers and that we were from Clinton, Wisconsin.""Hey, I'm a Cheesehead, too! Come gather around Cheeseheads, and I will tell you a story.""James Bradley just happened to be in Washington, D.C. to speak at the memorial the following day. He was there that night to say good-night to his dad, who had previously passed away, but whose image is part of the statue. He was just about to leave when he saw the buses pull up. I videotaped him as he spoke to us, and received his permission to share what he said from my videotape. It is one thing to tour the incredible monuments filled with history in Washington, D.C. but it is quite another to get the kind of insight we received that night. When all had gathered around he reverently began to speak. Here are his words from that night:""My name is James Bradley and I'm from Antigo, Wisconsin. My dad is on that statue, and I just wrote a book called Flags of Our Fathers which is #5 on the New York Times Best Seller list right now. It is the story of the six boys you see behind me. Six boys raised the flag. The first guy putting the pole in the ground is Harlon Block. Harlon was an all-state football player. He enlisted in the Marine Corps with all the senior members of his football team. They were off to play another type of game, a game called ""War."" But it didn't turn out to be a game. Harlon, at the age of twenty-one, died with his intestines in his hands. I don't say that to gross you out; I say that because there are generals who stand in front of this statue and talk about the glory of war. You guys need to know that most of the boys in Iwo Jima were seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen years old.(He pointed to the statue)You see this next guy? That's Rene Gagnon from New Hampshire. If you took Rene's helmet off at the moment this photo was taken, and looked in the webbing of that helmet, you would find a photograph. A photograph of his girlfriend. Rene put that in there for protection, because he was scared. He was eighteen years old. Boys won the battle of Iwo Jima. Boys. Not old men.The next guy here, the third guy in this tableau, was Sergeant Mike Strank. Mike is my hero. He was the hero of all these guys. They called him the ""old man"" because he was so old. He was already twenty-four. When Mike would motivate his boys in training camp, he didn't say, ""Let's go kill the enemy"" or ""Let's die for our country."" He knew he was talking to little boys. Instead he would say, ""You do what I say, and I'll get you home to your mothers.""The last guy on this side of the statue is Ira Hayes, a Pima Indian from Arizona. Ira Hayes walked off Iwo Jima. He went into the White House with my dad. President Truman told him, ""You're a hero."" He told reporters, ""How can I feel like a hero when 250 of my buddies hit the island with me and only twenty-seven of us walked off alive?""So you take your class at school. 250 of you spending a year together having fun, doing everything together. Then all 250 of you hit the beach, but only twenty-seven of your classmates walk off alive. That was Ira Hayes. He had images of horror in his mind. Ira Hayes died dead drunk, face down at the age of thirty-two, ten years after this picture was taken.The next guy, going around the statue, is Franklin Sousley from Hilltop, Kentucky, a fun-lovin' hillbilly boy. His best friend, who is now 70, told me, ""Yeah, you know, we took two cows up on the porch of the Hilltop General Store. Then we strung wire across the stairs so the cows couldn't get down. Then we fed them Epson salts. Those cows crapped all night.""Yes, he was a fun-lovin' hillbilly boy. Franklin died on Iwo Jima at the age of nineteen. When the telegram came to tell his mother that he was dead, it went to the Hilltop General Store. A barefoot boy ran that telegram up to his mother's farm. The neighbors could hear her scream all night and into the morning. The neighbors lived a quarter of a mile away.The next guy, as we continue to go around the statue, is my dad, John Bradley from Antigo, Wisconsin, where I was raised. My dad lived until 1994, but he would never give interviews. When Walter Cronkite's producers, or the New York Times would call, we were trained as little kids to say, ""No, I'm sorry sir, my dad's not here. He is in Canada fishing. No, there is no phone there, sir. No, we don't know when he is coming back.""My dad never fished or even went to Canada. Usually he was sitting right there at the table eating his Campbell's soup, but we had to tell the press that he was out fishing. He didn't want to talk to the press. You see, my dad didn't see himself as a hero. Everyone thinks these guys are heroes, 'cause they are in a photo and a monument. My dad knew better. He was a medic. John Bradley from Wisconsin was a caregiver. In Iwo Jima he probably held over 200 boys as they died, and when boys died in Iwo Jima, they writhed and screamed in pain.When I was a little boy, my third grade teacher told me that my dad was a hero. When I went home and told my dad that, he looked at me and said, ""I want you always to remember that the heroes of Iwo Jima are the guys who did not come back. DID NOT come back.""So that's the story about six nice young boys. Three died on Iwo Jima, and three came back as national heroes. Overall, 7000 boys died on Iwo Jima in the worst battle in the history of the Marine Corps. My voice is giving out, so I will end here. Thank you for your time.""Suddenly the monument wasn't just a big old piece of metal with a flag sticking out of the top. It came to life before our eyes with the heartfelt words of a son who did indeed have a father who was a hero. Maybe not a hero in his own eyes, but a hero nonetheless.[Powers, 2000]This article has been published in a number of books, including Powers' own Heart Touchers, as well as the compilations Chicken Soup for the Grandparent's Soul, God Allows U-Turns: American Moments, and Stories from a Soldier's Heart.This piece was circulating on the Internet by the end of 2000, and by the end of 2002 the following paragraphs had been tacked on to it, although they were neither part of James Bradley's talk nor Michael Powers' account of it:We need to remember that God created this vast and glorious world for us to live in, freely, but also at great sacrifice. Let us never forget from the revolutionary War to the Gulf War and all the wars in-between that sacrifice was made for our freedom.Remember to pray praises for this great country of ours and also pray for those still in murderous unrest around the world. STOP and thank God for being alive at someone else's sacrifice. God Bless.In January 2007, someone thought to add this postscript to the Internet-circulated piece:PS . One thing I learned while on tour with my 8th grade students in DC that is not mentioned here is that if you look at the statue very closely and count the number of ""hands"" raising the flag, there are 13. When the man who made the statue was asked why there were 13, he simply said the 13th hand was the hand of God.That part is false. The sculpture does not include a thirteenth hand — there are only twelve. The rumor about the 13th hand has been around for dog's years, though, spread both on the Internet and by amateur tour guides.Said the sculptor Felix de Weldon of the rumor: ""Thirteen hands. Who needed 13 hands? Twelve were enough."" SourcesBradley, James.   Flags of Our Fathers. New York: Bantam Books, 2000.   ISBN 0-553-11133-7.Kelly, John.   ""One Marine's Moment.""

"In November 2020, a photograph supposedly showing a rainbow-colored harpy eagle circulated on social media:This is not a genuine photograph of a harpy eagle. This image was digitally edited to make this beautiful bird appear more colorful than it is in reality. This image was created by Arstation user Godserg_art circa 2018 as part of a series of rainbow-colored animals. The original posting was accompanied by tags such as ""Digital Painting,"" ""illustration,"" and ""speedpaint,"" as well as a note from Godserg_art indicating that the software Photoshop was used to create this image. Godserg_art also created a rainbow tiger, a rainbow bear, and a rainbow wolf, all of which are clearly artistic renderings and not genuine photographs:The harpy eagle is the largest raptor in the Americas and one of the largest in the world. Full-grown harpy eagles have a wingspan that extends nearly 7 feet across and have talons that rival bear claws. The American Bird Conservancy writes:These powerful eagles are at the top of the rainforest food chain and have no natural predators. They prey on tree-dwelling mammals including sloths, monkeys, and opossums; large birds such as macaws and curassows; and reptiles like iguanas and snakes.Truly impressive birds, Harpy Eagles' legs are as thick as a person's arm and their talons are three to four inches long — the same size as a grizzly bear's claws!Although these are impressively large raptors, they aren't particularly colorful. PBS writes:""The harpy eagle has dark gray feathers with a white underside. A black band of plumage spans its neck and a fan of gray feathers crowns its head. Male and female plumage is identical.""Here's a genuine photograph of a harpy eagle:"	false

"It wouldn't be Christmas without stories about the ""war on Christmas,"" at least not for the making of viral news. One such story involved a rather expansive list of holiday-themed items deemed ""not acceptable"" for holiday classroom adornment by the principal of one Nebraska elementary school.Manchester Elementary principal Jennifer Sinclair sent a memorandum to parents and students informing them that candy canes were off limits because ""Historically, the shape [of the candy cane] is a 'J' for Jesus. The red is for the blood of Christ, and the white is a symbol of his resurrection. This would also include different colored candy canes.""The list essentially banned any Christmas-specific decor or activities, including Christmas carols and music, reindeer, Elf on the Shelf, and red and green items, but it allowed for non-Christmas winter imagery such as yetis, penguins and ""snowmen, snow women, snow people, snowflakes"":Acceptable practices:Gifts to students

193	"Mark Zuckerberg responded to a tweet from Elon Musk about cheating by posting, ""Speaking of cheating, you had an affair with Sergey Brin's wife last year."""	"On July 6, 2023, a screenshot of a tweet was shared on Twitter that appeared to show Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lashing out at Twitter owner Elon Musk. According to the screenshot, after Musk had tweeted a remark mentioning the word ""cheating,"" Zuckerberg responded, ""Speaking of cheating, you had an affair with Sergey Brin's wife last year.""ZUCK IS HOLDING BACK NO SHOTS pic.twitter.com/eRrx9Glp3R— LeGate🇺🇦 (@williamlegate) July 6, 2023However, no, this was not a real tweet sent out by Zuckerberg. The tweet screenshot initially appeared to have been created as a joke by tech entrepreneur William LeGate. In a Twitter DM, LeGate told us that he found the screenshot on Twitter, but did not create it himself.In the past, LeGate had become known by his loyal followers for posting other fake tweets, altered pictures, or simply just untrue information. For example, we previously reported about when LeGate promoted a false rumor that claimed Twitter was raising the rates of its Twitter Blue service to $15 per month.A few different factors were at play when this fake tweet screenshot was created that involved either Zuckerberg or Musk, or both of them. We've detailed information about all of these factors below.First, Zuckerberg truly does own the Twitter handle @finkd. In fact, he had tweeted for the first time in more than 11 years on the night of July 5 by posting an old Spider-Man meme. The meme shows two people in Spider-Man costumes pointing at each other. The tweet was referred to by CBS News as a ""playful jab at Elon Musk's Twitter.""pic.twitter.com/MbMxUWiQgp— Mark Zuckerberg (@finkd) July 6, 2023The second factor at play with the fake tweet screenshot was talk of a possible cage match fight between Musk and Zuckerberg. Musk first tweeted about the possibility of a cage match with Zuckerberg on June 20.I'm up for a cage match if he is lol— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 21, 2023Days later, on July 1, The New York Times reported that Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), had received a text from Zuckerberg, asking if Musk was serious about a fight. White has since had multiple phone calls with both men, telling the Times, ""They both want to do it.""The third factor happening around the time that the fake tweet screenshot was posted was the fact that Zuckerberg had just launched Meta's new challenger to Twitter an app named Threads. The app became available to the public on the night of July 5.In the fake tweet screenshot, the fake Zuckerberg response was to a real tweet from Musk. Hours before the screenshot was posted, the @TitterDaily account reported, ""NEWS: Twitter is threatening to sue Meta over 'systematic, willful and unlawful misappropriation' of Twitter's trade secrets and IP, as well as scraping of Twitter's data, in a cease-and-desist letter sent yesterday to Zuckerberg by Elon's lawyer Alex Spiro.""In a reply, Musk said, ""Competition is fine, cheating is not."" It was this tweet that Zuckerberg supposedly replied to, but again, it was all a joke.Competition is fine, cheating is not— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 6, 2023CBS News reported on the news of Twitter threatening legal action over Threads, citing a letter posted on the app's website, threads.net, that was published by Semafor.As for the claim of ""cheating"" and an ""affair"" that appeared in the fake tweet screenshot, this subject involved Musk, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and his ex-wife, Nicole Shanahan.On July 6, People magazine reported on the matter, writing, ""Nicole Shanahan 'Moving On' 1 Year After Alleged Elon Musk Affair, Sergey Brin Split (Exclusive)."" Both Shanahan and Musk have denied the allegation that they were previously romantically involved.Musk tweeted in July 2022 that the affair rumor was ""total BS,"" and added, ""Haven't even had sex in ages (sigh)."""	false
4554	"U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the political class wouldn't accept U.S. President Donald Trump among its ranks because he isn't a ""vetted politician"" and is among the ""common people."""	"In early April 2020, social media users shared a meme containing a quote purportedly made by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The text in the meme, supposedly sourced from the Democratic congresswoman from California, stated Pelosi had opined that the political class would not accept U.S. President Donald Trump into their ranks because he is one of the ""common people.""The full text of the meme reads, ""Donald Trump is NOT a politician, properly vetted by the political arena and we do not accept common people in the reins of power. Common people are NOT allowed to be president and we DON'T care who this shutdown hurts, we will show the American people who runs this country.""We could find no record of Pelosi making the remark or any comment with similar meaning (or any instance of Pelosi referring to Trump as a ""common person""), thus it appears to have been made up and falsely attributed to her. It's also unlikely that even Trump, who has reported he has a multi-billion dollar fortune and has frequently been photographed in his gold-encrusted New York penthouse, would describe himself as a ""common"" person."	false
1337	Woman wins $1,000 in a Carnation Milk slogan contest by submitting a bawdy bit of verse.	"Although milk has long been a staple of the American diet, a century ago many people did not have access to fresh milk.A little lady from North Carolina had worked in and around family dairy farms since she was old enough to walk, with hours of hard work and little compensation, and when canned Carnation Milk became available in grocery stores (1940's or 50's?) she read an advertisement offering $5,000 for the best slogan/rhyme beginning with ""Carnation Milk is best of all..."" She said, 'I know all about milk and dairy farms... I can do this!'She sent in her entry and about a week later, a black limo drove up in front of her house. A man got out and said, ""Carnation LOVED your entry so much, we are here to award you $1000, even though we will not be able to use it.""Here is her entry:Carnation milk is best of all,No tits to pull, no shit to haul;No buckets to wash, no hay to pitch,Just poke a hole in the son-of-a-bitch!Because of the comparatively primitive states of the transportation and refrigeration industries back then, milk — a highly perishable food item — could not generally be transported over long distances efficiently, and therefore those who did not live sufficiently close to a dairy supply source (or keep their own cows) could not count on having regular access to safe, unspoiled milk.The solution to this marketing roadblock was the development of evaporated milk, a product created through a process which greatly reduced the volume of whole milk by removing about 60% of its water content via evaporation and ensured it remained fit for consumption much longer than fresh milk by subjecting it to heat-treatment sterilization and sealing it into cans. The finished product could be transported over long distances much more easily than whole milk because it was considerably reduced in volume and weight and did not require refrigeration. By adding water to the contents of a can of evaporated milk, consumers could obtain a reasonable substitute for fresh, whole milk and be assured that the product was sanitary.(Although the terms ""evaporated milk"" and ""condensed milk"" are often used interchangeably, the latter term can refer to either of two very different products. Evaporated milk and unsweetened condensed milk are both products made by removing approximately 60% of the water from whole milk and sterilizing the remainder through heat-treatment. Sweetened condensed milk is produced by adding a good deal of sugar to milk prior to removing 60% of its water, producing a sticky, sweet mixture which does not need to be heat-sterilized [because the added sugar acts as a natural preservative] and which cannot be turned back into a drink similar to whole milk through the addition of water.)One of the pioneers of the evaporated milk business was a grocer from Kent, Washington, named Elbridge Amos Stuart, who in 1899 co-founded the Pacific Coast Condensed Milk Company, selling canned evaporated milk to prospectors heading north to the Yukon gold rush. Stuart's faith in the general marketability of evaporated milk was well-founded, and, as sales began to grow, legend has it that he stumbled across the now-famous name for his product while strolling through downtown Seattle. Spotting a display of ""Carnation"" cigars in a tobacconist's window, Stuart thought the brand name an odd one for a stogie but a good one for his own product, and thus began the association of canned evaporated milk with a red-and-white label bearing the name Carnation.Stuart was as concerned with the ingredients that went into his product as he was with the process of making it, and he maintained the firm belief that a steady supply of good-quality milk could be ensured only by obtaining it from healthy cows. To that end he furnished his suppliers with purebred bulls to help them breed better milk cows, and he eventually established his own breeding farm, known as Carnation Farm. Stuart's philosophy of ""contented cows give better milk"" is reflected in this ad copy from a 1909 Carnation Milk newspaper advertisement:The superior flavor of Carnation Milk is merely that of rich, whole milk, unusually delicious because of the favorable climatic conditions peculiar to the north Pacific coast, where Carnation Milk cows, healthy and contented, are pastured all the year. These conditions and the extreme care and promptness exercised in handling, cooling and sterilizing, combine to make Carnation Milk nutritious, safe and tempting to the delicate appetite.Evaporated milk soon became, as its founder had envisioned, as much a staple of grocery store shelves as salt or sugar. Although Carnation was far from the only brand of evaporated milk available (Borden's Eagle was a strong competitor), it has long been the market leader and best-known national brand of evaporated milk in America, and generations of Americans raised on it fondly recall the familiar sight of red-and-white Carnation cans in their kitchen cupboards. By the time it was bought up by Nestlé S.A. in 1985, the Carnation company had grown from a producer of evaporated milk to a multi-billion-dollar conglomerate offering over 200 products, including market-leading brands in everything from tomato paste (Contadina) to pet food (Friskies).Such was the fame and ubiquity of Carnation Evaporated Milk in America that it became the subject of an affection expressed through humorous, satirical rhymes. Just a schoolkids of my own era (the 1960s) spun nonsensical riffs on popular songs, television theme music, and commercial jingles, so those of an earlier time delighted in inventing and repeating variations on a bawdy bit of verse about a familiar household product:Carnation milk is best of all;no teats to pull, no poop to haul.Got no nasty tail to switch;just poke a hole in the son-of-a-bitch!""  Summer, winter, spring or fall,Carnation milk is best of all;no tits to pull, no tails to switch,just punch a hole in the son of a bitch!  Carnation milk is best of all,comes in cans both short and tall:No tits to pull,no hay to pitch;just punch two holesin the son-of-a-bitch.  Carnation Milk is best in the land;it comes in a little red-and-white can.No tits to pull, no hay to pitch;just poke a hole in the son-of-a-bitch.Although catchy rhymes and consumer participation contests are methods which have been used by a number of companies over the years to promote their products (see our Burma-Shave page for a prime example), Carnation did not sponsor a contest inviting consumers to complete a rhyme beginning with the line ""Carnation Milk is best of all..."" which prompted the submission of the ""just poke a hole"" verse by a ""little lady from North Carolina"" who mailed it to Carnation and was rewarded with a $1,000 prize for her efforts. This piece is just a funny bit of doggerel fashioned about a common household product by a variety of anonymous jokesters decades ago which has since been dressed up with a framework presenting it as ""true story"" in a fashion similar to many other jokes-turned-urban-legend.Printed references to this verse indicate that it might be almost a century old itself. For example, the following presentation appears in a college literature textbook:Anonymous (American oral verse)CARNATION MILK  (about 1900?)Carnation milk is the best in the land;Here I sit with a can in my hand -No tits to pull, no hay to pitch,You just punch a hole in the son of a bitch."	false
4196	Evidence shows rare night clouds are linked to human-caused climate change.	The occurrence of a rare form of night cloud is increasing in parts of the world, and may serve as an indication that the presence of human-caused greenhouse gases responsible for climate change is also on the rise in the Earth’s atmosphere.Noctilucent (Latin for “night-shining”) clouds are typically rare, and are located at a height of around 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth in a layer of atmosphere known as the Mesosphere. These wispy clouds are only visible on clear, summer nights at mid-to high latitudes, and only form under specific conditions, according to the United Kingdom Metrological Office. As water vapor freezes around specks of dust at low mesospheric temperatures, newly formed ice crystals are illuminated from the low-angled sun during dusk and dawn. But increasing human-caused pollutants — like methane and particulate matter — means that both the amount of water vapor and levels of dust in the atmosphere are also on the rise, spurring an increase in the occurrence of noctilucent clouds.https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=_-d6UJl83rU&feature=emb_logoDust can come from man-made pollutants, as well as natural processes such as dust left behind from passing meteors or matter projected into the atmosphere from volcanoes. On the other hand, water vapor can come both from the Earth’s surface through natural mechanisms or via methane, which produces water vapor through chemical reactions that occur in the atmosphere. As such, a 2018 study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found that noctilucent clouds may serve as an indicator of human-caused climate change.To come to their conclusions, researchers with the American Geophysical Union ran computer models and satellite observations to simulate how greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels have contributed to an increased occurrence of noctilucent clouds over the last 150 years. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, it appears that methane emissions have increased water vapor concentration by about 40 percent, contributing to more than double the amount of mesospheric ice.“We speculate that the clouds have always been there, but the chance to see one was very, very poor, in historical times,” said Franz-Josef Lübken, an atmospheric scientist at the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics in Kühlungsborn, Germany, in a statement.Though the presence of noctilucent clouds fluctuates every year, they were shown to become more frequent over the course of the study period, confirming similar findings published in a 1989 edition of Nature. Together, the studies provide a sign that the burning of fossil fuels appears to be affecting natural processes reaching high into Earth’s atmosphere.The authors caution that observing interactions in the mesosphere is rather challenging.” Little is known about trends over long periods of time and databases documenting long-term trends is “still rather poor.” That being said, the researchers argue that modern technologies and increasing observational data in recent decades provide further evidence that human-caused greenhouse gases may increase the likelihood of noctilucent cloud formation.	true
4602	Experts and officials warned in 2018 that the U.S. government would be unable to respond effectively to a pandemic.	"In late March and early April 2020, social media users revisited a 2018 tweet posted by Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Senior Fellow Stephen Schwartz, in which he paraphrased a Washington Post article that reported the Trump administration had disbanded the National Security Council's pandemic response team.The tweet, dated May 10, 2018, read, ""When the next pandemic occurs (and make no mistake, it will) and the federal government is unable to respond in a coordinated and effective fashion to protect the lives of US citizens and others, this decision by John Bolton and Donald Trump will be why.""

Some who shared the tweet amid the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 pointed to the date of the tweet and noted its apparent prescience. But Schwartz followed up on March 15, 2020, by thanking the experts quoted in the article, who themselves raised the alarm that the actions of U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration regarding pandemic preparedness left the United States vulnerable:

The people tagged in Schwartz' tweet are global health and development advocate Carolyn Reynolds; Jeremy Konyndyk, who led foreign disaster assistance for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under President Barack Obama; and Luciana Borio, former director for the National Security Council's Medical and Biodefense Preparedness under Trump.Those three were quoted in the Post's 2018 report in the following passage:This week, the administration released a list of $15 billion in spending cuts it wants Congress to approve. Among the targets is $252 million in unused funds remaining from the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people, far exceeding the combined total cases reported in about 20 previous outbreaks since the 1970s.The White House proposal “is threatening to claw back funding whose precise purpose is to help the United States be able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis,” said Carolyn Reynolds, a vice president at PATH, a global health technology nonprofit.Collectively, warns Jeremy Konyndyk, who led foreign disaster assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Obama administration, “What this all adds up to is a potentially really concerning rollback of progress on U.S. health security preparedness.”“It seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over the last 15 years,” said Konyndyk, now a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. “These moves make us materially less safe. It’s inexplicable.”The day before news of [Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense Timothy] Ziemer’s exit became public, one of the officials on his team, Luciana Borio, director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the NSC, spoke at a symposium at Emory University to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic. That event killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide."	true

When another Twitter user asked if the post was true, the account replied, ""No."" The original post was apparently intended as a joke.There was other evidence the claim wasn't true, as well.

If the company had announced it was spending such an amount on ads on the platform, especially with the connection both companies have to Musk, reputable news publications would have reported and analyzed the decision. In March 2023, it was reported that Twitter revenue and adjusted earnings fell about 40% in December 2022, after advertisers left the platform following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company, according to the Wall Street Journal. "	false
1656	A video shows Pope Francis withdrawing his hand as a line of people attempted to kiss his papal ring.	"Pope Francis has been the subject of a few fake videos over the years. In 2015, for example, a humorous clip showing the pope performing the tablecloth magic trick was produced for The Ellen DeGeneres Show. A similarly fake video was created for The Jimmy Kimmel Show in 2017, that one showing the pope repeatedly slap away President Donald Trump's hand.So when a video of Pope Francis withdrawing his hand from a line of people as they attempted to kiss the papal ring went viral in March 2019 (promoted by some of the same comedians who created their own pope hoaxes), some viewers were unsure of the video's authenticity:But this was a genuine video of Pope Francis. It was filmed during his visit to Loreto, Italy, on 25 March 2019 and captured the pope greeting parishioners at the end of a service.But why was the pope withdrawing his hands? The viral clip drew a number of theories. Some viewers hypothesized that the issue had to do with spreading germs, while others claimed it had more to do with Catholic tradition and the symbolism of kissing a person's ring.The viral clip shows about one minute of a greeting session in which the pope met with more than 100 monks, nuns, and parishioners. According to BBC News, these people were not given instructions on how to greet the pontiff, and while many simply shook his hands, others attempted to kiss his ring:Official Vatican TV footage shows that Francis stood in a receiving line for around 13 minutes and received (by my count) at least 113 monks, nuns, and parishioners -- either individually or in pairs.No one appeared to offer any instruction on how to greet him. During the first 10 minutes, 14 people shook Francis's hand without bowing down to kiss his ring.In this time, 41 people bowed down towards Francis' hands, either making the symbolic gesture of kissing his ring, or actually kissing the ring itself.Eventually, the pope started to withdraw his hands as people attempted to kiss his ring.Christopher Bellitto, a medieval church history scholar and professor at Kean University, and John Allen, a Vatican journalist, told the Washington Post that while kissing the pope's ring was once common practice, both the Church and Pope Francis have started to move away from symbols of subservience:Medieval church history scholar Christopher Bellitto, a professor at Kean University, said the ancient tradition of kissing the pope’s ring is not part of any formal protocol while greeting the pope, but one synonymous with patterns of behavior for how one would greet kings, queens and emperors.“When one greeted Ramses or Nebuchadnezzar, I’m sure it was common practice to bow and kiss one’s ring.”Now, says Bellitto, “it’s a leftover that is best left over.”“This isn’t as much of a Francis story, as much as a story about the modern papacy,” he added.John Allen, a veteran Vatican journalist and editor of the online Catholic news site Crux, concurred, saying Francis’s actions are one further move in a trend that’s continued since Pope John XXIII to “dial down the tradition of subservience,” which has traditionally marked the papacy over the centuries.Eric Sundrup of America magazine noted that Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI were also resistant towards having parishioners kiss the papal ring:Protocols evolve and changes can be confusing, especially when most people only meet a reigning monarch (or pope) once in their lives. As we have seen in the past few days, old habits die hard, even when the pope is trying to keep the receiving line moving. So while Pope Francis might not be a fan of hand and ring kissing, he is actually following the lead of John Paul II and Benedict XVI.Before the Second Vatican Council, it was customary in most countries for both priests and laity to kiss a bishop’s ring upon greeting him as a sign of respect and obedience. But times change, and the gesture can also be seen as furthering clericalism and ties to temporal power. Both Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI before him have tried to discourage the practice when the pope is receiving visitors, and Francis was resistant to the practice when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires as well.While kissing the papal ring may be going out of fashion, Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti spoke with reporters a few days after the video went viral and said that the pope withdrew his hands from some parishioners because he wanted to ""avoid the risk of contagion for the people"":“The Holy Father told me that the motivation was very simple: hygiene,” Gisotti told reporters. “He wants to avoid the risk of contagion for the people, not for him.”The tradition of kissing the ring of a bishop or pope goes back centuries, as a sign of respect and obedience.Gisotti noted that Francis is more than happy to receive the ring-kiss in small groups, where the spread of germs is more contained, as he did Wednesday when a handful of people were lined up at the end of his general audience to greet him.Several bent down to kiss his ring, and Francis patiently allowed it.“You all know that he has a great joy in meeting and embracing people, and being embraced by them,” Gisotti said.It should also be noted that Pope Francis continued to greet parishioners after the events depicted in the viral clip. In addition to meeting a few more people in the church, the pope also met with a number of people after the service outside of the cathedral.The entire service (and post service greetings) can be viewed in the video below. The pope starts shaking hands with nuns, bishops, and other parishioners inside the church around the 1:03:30 mark:"	true
1464	"Pornhub ""sanctioned"" Russia after its attack on Ukraine by blocking Russian users from accessing the site."	"On Feb. 25, 2022, shortly after more international sanctions were announced to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine, a rumor started circulating on social media that the adult website Pornhub had also announced its own ""sanctions"" on the country by blocking Russian users from accessing its site. According to the rumor, Russian users who attempted to access Pornhub were blocked from its content and instead shown the Ukrainian flag:This was the text of the rumor: ""The sanction nobody is talking about. Russian users who attempted to visit pornhub were quite literally cockblocked by a message that told them that the content has been stopped along with a Ukranian [sic] flag and message of Ukranian [sic] support.""There's zero evidence to support these claims. A spokesperson for Pornhub told us: ""This is completely false. We have not blocked anyone from Russia.""While we encountered a few messages posted in the immediate aftermath of Russia's attack that joked about the potential impact of a Pornhub ban, the above-displayed account appears to be the first to have spread this rumor as if it were a genuine news item. It's odd, then, that this account included a generic logo for Pornhub in its tweet and not screenshots showing the alleged image of a Ukrainian flag and message of support. Furthermore, several Twitter users attempted to access Pornhub via a VPN, a Virtual Private Network that allows them to set their location to Russia, to test the claim. Samantha Cole, a reporter for Motherboard, posted on Twitter:We used the same method to replicate the experience a user in Russia would have while accessing Pornhub, and came up with the same results. We did not encounter a Ukrainian flag or a message of support, nor was our access to the website blocked.After being asked to sign into a VK.com account (VK is a Russian social network similar to Facebook), we were able to access the site from an IP address located in Moscow, Russia.Here's a screenshot showing our Moscow IP address and a censored (by us) version of the page we were greeted with upon accessing Pornhub. While Pornhub has not banned Russians from using the site, Russia once banned its own citizens from using Pornhub, though only for a short time."	false
4369	Nickelodeon, the children's network, went off air for eight minutes and 46 seconds to protest police brutality.	"Rumors are surging in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting protests against police violence and racial injustice in the United States. Stay informed. Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here.
On June 1, 2020, a brief video clip supposedly showing how the children's network Nickelodeon went dark for eight minutes and 46 seconds -- the length of time a Minnesota police officer named Derek Chauvin, who is white, knelt on the neck of George Floyd, killing the unarmed black man -- in support of justice and equality. The clip began to circulate on social media:This is a genuine image that was aired on Nickelodeon. The Washington Post reported that all of the networks owned by ViacomCBS (including MTV, VHI, CMT, and Nickelodeon) went dark in honor of Floyd and in support of social justice.At 5 p.m. on most Mondays, the cable landscape dominated by ViacomCBS is filled with familiar sights: Jim playing pranks on Dwight on “The Office”; the host Rob Dyrdek mocking viral-video wannabes on “Ridiculousness,” actor Tim Allen unsuccessfully trying to rule his roost on “Last Man Standing.”But viewers tuning in on this Monday were greeted with something different: a black screen with the words “I Can’t Breathe,” flashing in rhythm to the sounds of loud labored breathing.The piece, one-part tribute, one-part video art, honored George Floyd, the Minnesota man who died at the hands of police, and the national wave of Black Lives Matter protests his death jump-started. It lasted the same amount of time — 8 minutes and 46 seconds — that police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck. Ten ViacomCBS cable channels, including Comedy Central, MTV and CMT, carried the message.Here's a video of what aired on ViacomCBS networks for eight minutes and 46 seconds on June 1:While MTV, VH1, and ViacomCBS' other networks geared toward adults aired the above-displayed video, Nickelodeon itself appears to have opted for a message that was more directly aimed at children. Newsweek reported that the above-displayed video also aired on Nickelodeon, but we have not been able to confirm that.Even so, Nickelodeon did display a screen explaining that it was “going off the air for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in support of justice, equality, and human rights"" followed by a message the network deemed a ""Declaration of Kid's Rights"" that appeared on their social media pages. The social media message included the words, ""We are all part of the change #blacklivesmatter.""Nickelodeon also shared a second message with the #blacklivesmatter hashtag:"	true
2225	Gun manufacturing is the only industry in America that is exempt from being sued.	"On Feb. 3, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden claimed in a speech about gun violence and policing in New York City that gun manufacturers are part of ""the only industry in America"" that is exempt from being sued.Sitting next to New York State officials, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Merrick Garland, Biden asserted the following, according to video footage of the event and the official White House transcript:Imagine had we had a liability — they’re the only industry in America that is exempted from being able to be sued by the public. The only one. Imagine had that been the way with cigarette manufacturers. Where the hell would we — where the heck would we be? We’d be in tough shape.Why gun manufacturers? Because of the power of their lobbying ability. It’s got to end. End. They’ve got to be held responsible for the things that they do that are irresponsible.And, folks, you know, it’s the only industry in America, as I said, that’s exempt from being sued. And I think — I find it to be outrageous.[See The Associated Press' coverage of Biden's full remarks in New York City here.]Conservative media outlets such as Townhall.com and the National Review highlighted the above-transcribed claim by the president, and numerous commentators called into question its legitimacy.The president's statement was untrue on multiple levels.While the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act provides gun manufacturers some exemptions in liability (it grants them immunity against lawsuits alleging wrongdoing because their products were used in crimes), people can still sue gun manufacturers for a variety of reasons and be successful.Next, the country's gun-making industry is not the only sector for which federal lawmakers have developed some liability protections. For example, the federal government has granted vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer and Moderna immunity from liability if something goes unintentionally wrong with their COVID-19 shots, as reported by CNBC.CNN fact-checking database said of the president's Feb. 3 claim:[Gun] manufacturers can still be held liable for (and thus sued for) a range of things, including negligence, breach of contract regarding the purchase of a gun, or certain damages from defects in the design of a gun.In 2019, the Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit against gun manufacturer Remington Arms Company to continue. The plaintiffs, a survivor and families of nine other victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, are attempting to hold the company, which manufactured the semi-automatic rifle that was used in the killing, partly responsible by targeting the company's marketing practices, another area where gun manufacturers can be held liable.Other industries also have some exemptions in liability. For example, vaccine manufacturers cannot be held liable in a civil suit for damages from a vaccine-related injury or death. And for the next four years, pharmaceutical companies developing the Covid-19 vaccines will have immunity from liability under the 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. Those who claim to have been harmed by vaccines may receive money from the government, not the pharmaceutical company, via the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.For those reasons, we rate this claim ""False.""We reached out the White House's press office in an email that laid out the above-outlined evidence that proves the president's statement wrong. We will update this report when, or if, we receive a comment."	false

"Target's 2023 Pride collection includes items labeled in stores as ""tuck-friendly,"" but none of these items is available in ""kids' sizes,"" designed for children, or marketed to children.On May 19, 2023, anti-LGBTQ groups and commentators promoted the claim that Target was selling ""'tuck-friendly'"" bathing suits for children.""Viral videos referenced two items with a tag highlighting the bathing suits' ""tuck-friendly construction"" and ""extra crotch coverage features."" Such clothing is aimed at transitioning or non-gender-conforming people. Several viral tweets alleged that these products were what ""you will find in the kid's section"" of Target. Both of these products can be found on Target's website, and neither of them is designed for children. Claims that the products were for kids appear to come from an apparent disbelief in the notion that some adults are small, and the fact that some Pride collection displays were near a children's clothing section.""Either those are sizes for kids,"" the Daily Wire's Matt Walsh opined, ""or for very, very, very small adults."" Newsmax and Daily Mail described the items as ""seemingly designed for children."" The latter claim is based on the proximity of seasonal displays like the Pride collection to children's clothing, and the fact that the seasonal display ""includes items for babies and children.""Kayla Castaneda, a spokesperson for Target, told The Associated Press (AP) that the ""tuck-friendly"" items are not available in kids' sizes.

This image has been stretched to make this person look much taller. While we have not been able to find the specific origins of this altered image, we did find what appears to be the original source photograph. Here's a side-by-side of the stretched image (left) and the apparent original photograph (right). The altered image has been circulating since at least May 2020. If this picture and claim were accurate, Ladu would have certainly been added to the ""Guinness Book of World Records"" by now, but that isn't the case. Guinness lists the late Robert Wadlow, who stood at 8 feet 11.1 inches tall, as the world's tallest man.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5McWw03Ryrs

When last measured on 27 June 1940, the mild-mannered American stretched a staggering 2.72 m (8 ft 11.1 in) tall.Perhaps surprisingly, Robert entered the world no differently to most babies. He was born on 22 February 1918 to two regular-sized parents, weighing an unremarkable 3.85 kg (8.7 lb). But he rapidly started to shoot up, reaching an incredible 1.63 m (5 ft 4 in) by the age of five, by which time he was already wearing clothes intended for teenagers.The tallest living man, Sultan Kösen, stands at just over 8 feet tall. "	false

"Beginning in October 2018, social media users regaled one another with what appeared to be a news article reporting the death of a New York City man who supposedly contracted an E. coli infection by performing analingus (oral-to-anal sex) on his girlfriend.The story they were sharing originated on a disreputable website called Huzlers, who published the article on 5 October. The headline read (grammatical errors in the original): ""Man Eats Girlfriends Booty for the First Time Dies from E. Coli."" The text of the poorly written article reported that:Michael Benson wanted to try something new in bed to spice things up in bed with his girlfriend who will remain anonymous.

865	U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy signaled to GOP hecklers including, on multiple occasions, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, to be quiet during the 2023 State of the Union address.	"McCarthy appeared to signal members of his own caucus at least three times to refrain from heckling President Joe Biden during his 2023 State of the Union address. In most if not all of those cases, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was involved in the heckling. On Feb. 7, 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden delivered his second State of the Union speech before a joint session of Congress. Prior to the speech, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and other Republican leaders assured reporters that the Republican caucus would be civil. These assurances did not stop some members of the GOP from interrupting Biden during his address. In response to these interruptions, McCarthy — seated behind the president — appeared to ""shush"" the hecklers more than once. Based on the direction of the apparent shushing, McCarthy was signaling members of his own caucus to be quiet. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesTweets mentioning at least three such instances went viral following the speech, and each appeared to involve, at least in part, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.The first instance occurred during an exchange over Biden's assertion that some members of the GOP had advocated for ""sunsetting"" Social Security and Medicare. CBS Evening News Anchor Norah O'Donnell tweeted that ""Marjorie Taylor Greene stood up and called him a liar. Speaker McCarthy shushed his caucus from the podium.""The tweet shows an unedited portion of the speech, which begins at 1:05:57 in the official C-SPAN feed. The second instance occurred during a portion of the speech regarding China-U.S. relations.

282	A video game controller was used to operate the OceanGate Expeditions missing submersible used for exploring the wreckage of the RMS Titanic in June 2023.	"In June 2023, a rumor spread on Twitter and other social media platforms that claimed a video game controller was used to operate the doomed Titan submersible that had been intended for exploring the deep-sea remains of the RMS Titanic. The latter struck an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean on April 14, 1912, and then sunk in the early morning hours on the following day, killing around 1,500 people.The device used to steer the missing submarine near the Titanic was a $29.99 gaming controller pic.twitter.com/3Hetf0KRH2— Dexerto (@Dexerto) June 20, 2023In our research regarding this rumor, we soon reviewed evidence that showed it was true.This story began in the early morning hours of June 18, when the Titan submersible managed by OceanGate Expeditions started its voyage to the ocean floor in order to document the wreckage of Titanic. Five people were on board.The official website for OceanGate advertised the opportunity to ""explore the Titanic"" for a price starting at $250,000 per person. The package included a stay on a ship that would last eight days and seven nights.Hours after the submersible and its passengers began the voyage, however, it did not reappear at the surface of the ocean for its scheduled return.Days later, the world learned that the sub had apparently imploded on the same morning that it began its descent, ending the lives of all five crew members, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.As for the rumor about the video game controller, pictures were shared on Twitter that showed OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush holding one of these devices.The Titanic tourist submarine that went missing was controlled by a Logitech gaming controller pic.twitter.com/bh80ROmCui— Culture Crave 🍿 (@CultureCrave) June 20, 2023Reporting published by The Independent featured a tweet from a user who had identified that it was not specifically an Xbox game controller or a PlayStation controller that operated the sub, but rather a Logitech F710 Wireless PC Gamepad.""It has Xbox buttons but PlayStation stick layout,"" Twitter user Matthew Ruddle posted. The controller once retailed for $29.99 on Amazon, while other websites priced it between $33.99 and $49.99.The news can't decide if the Titanic submarine controller is an Xbox pad or a PlayStation pad so I was curious what they actually use for this claustrophobic nightmare.Found it: It's a Logitech F710 Wireless PC Gamepad from 2011.

Within that article was a video published in December 2014 that contained more details about a previous gaming controller that was used. In that case, it was specifically a Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) controller.Several TikTok and Twitter users shared this part of the CBS broadcast, but did not include the very next moment in the report when Pogue asked a question about the safety of the sub. In Rush's answer, he said that the main part of the sub's infrastructure was designed with help from Boeing, NASA, and, as mentioned in the video above, the University of Washington:Pogue: It seems like this submersible has some elements of ""MacGyver-y,"" jerry-rigged-ness. I mean, you're putting construction pipes as ballasts.Rush: I don't know if I'd use that description of it, but there are certain things you want to be buttoned down. So, the pressure vessel [part] is not ""MacGyver"" at all, because that's where we worked with Boeing, and NASA, and [the] University of Washington. Everything else can fail. Your thrusters can go.

6171	Black Lives Matter leader Marquesha Johnson was sued for embezzling millions of dollars in donations.	"Two of the favorite targets of disreputable, right-wing web sites are the Black Lives Matter movement and the ""mainstream liberal news media."" In February 2018, the MediaConservative.com web site republished a fabricated story that ticked both those boxes.The story attacked a purportedly prominent member of Black Lives Matter named Marquesha Johnson, accusing her of ""organizing over 900 events and gather[ing] millions of dollars in donations"" to escape homelessness and purchase a million-dollar home with donations solicited to help the social justice movement. MediaConservative wrote: In fact, the donations [Johnson] collected helped only herself to “rise” in society. A class action lawsuit, stated that Johnson had “solicited donations from vulnerable people to help others but instead used it to help herself.”According to the document, the Black Lives Matter leading figure, purchased a $1.2 million home for herself. But this is not all, instead of using the donations to help people she also bought herself a brand new Range rover as well as some “other exorbitancies”.The post rehashes a story originally published in November 2017 by the ""satirical"" web site ReaganWasRight.com, which falsely reported:Unfortunately, it’s likely that what she did was perfectly legal because she solicited the funds through a GoFundMe campaign and the company is notoriously bad at working with police to crack down on scammers. Johnson was questioned by police, but denies misusing funds. She refuses to hand over records.We found no evidence that corroborates any of these claims, which were also circulated on the ConservativeStand.com web site. The ReaganWasRight.com article linked to a federal court records database, but there is no record there of any lawsuit against a Marquesha Johnson. In fact, we could find no evidence of a leading Black Lives Matter campaigner of that name. The image used in all three articles does not show ""Marquesha Johnson"" and her ""$1.2 million home."" In fact, it is a composite of a police photograph of Temitope Adebamiro, a Delaware woman sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 for stabbing her husband to death, and a photograph of Las Ventanas Al Paraiso, a resort in Los Cabos, Mexico, owned by the billionaire Ty Warner. In other words, the story and the accompanying photo are both outright fabrications.ConservativeStand.com publishes sensationalist right-wing content, and has a disclaimer stating the authors don't guarantee the accuracy of what they publish:All the information on this website is published in good faith and for general information purpose only. ConservativeStand does not make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information. ReaganWasRight.com, the original source of the fabricated ""Marquesha Johnson"" story, is run by Christopher Blair, a well-known purveyor of fake news and so-called satire who is also behind the web sites Last Line of Defense, Freedum Junkshun and As American As Apple Pie.In a disclaimer on ReaganWasRight.com, Blair makes it clear that nothing published on the web site is to be taken as accurate:Reagan Was Right is a whimsical playland of conservative satire…Everything on this web site is fiction. Despite claims of satire from these sites, it's not at all clear what this particular article is satirizing, or where the humor is in a false story about a black woman activist stealing millions of dollars which had been donated in good faith to a prominent social justice movement. "	false
769	A photograph authentically shows police officers measuring women's bathing suits for compliance with modesty laws on Venice Beach, California, around 1930.	"A photograph commonly shared on Reddit and other social media sites is described as showing ""Bathing suit police/beach censors enforcing modesty at Venice Beach."" This picture is genuine and the description of its location is accurate. It's part of the Security Pacific National Bank Collection of photographs contained in the digital collections of the Los Angeles Public Library. Its date is listed as circa 1930, and the photograph's description reads:Two policemen on the beach measure the bathing suits on a line of women in order to determine if they are wearing anything too skimpy. A crowd seated on the sand behind them watches the fun.In the 1920s and '30s, several states and local governments had laws in place regulating how revealing a woman's bathing attire could be in public. The beaches of Los Angeles, California, were no exception. A March 1930 story in Venice, California's, Evening Vanguard, as an example, described a conference called between all the county's beach authorities to standardize so-called bathing suit rules:At the present time much confusion results from the varying regulations which are in effect at different beaches. A bathing suit, for instance, which may be perfectly proper and acceptable at one beach is distinctly taboo at another. …At the present time different regulations apply in the matter of bathing suits, particularly those for women. This causes many beach patrons to violate laws at times without knowing it. An April 1930 article in the same paper reported that, ""Venice police have already received numerous complaints from citizens of bathers who parade the business and residential streets of that community in bathing attire, contrary to law,"" suggesting active enforcement of bathing suit laws in Venice at the time. "	true

An advertisement created by the website Yeah Motor, which was hosted by the advertising platform Taboola, showed the image of the vehicle with the words: ""The Military Spent $1 Billion on This New Vehicle, And Here's The First Look.""Readers who clicked the advertisement were led to a 52-page slideshow on Yeah Motor, where the image of the ball vehicle did not appear. This method of drawing in readers with clickbait to a slideshow with multiple pages is known as advertising arbitrage. With arbitrage, the goal is to make more money on the ads displayed during the slideshow than it costs to place the ads that drive readers to the story in the first place.The MAD LAB YouTube channel also featured the image in a thumbnail for the video, ""Best Off-Road Vehicles of All Time.""However, the vehicle doesn't show up in the 12-minute video. The MAD LAB YouTube channel turned off the ability to like or dislike the video — where viewers can click a thumbs-up or thumbs-down icon — which is unique to this video in particular. The feature was perhaps disabled because of the large number of dislikes the video was receiving for failing to deliver on the promise in the thumbnail. Other videos on the channel allowed the liking and disliking of videos.The image is also featured on several other YouTube videos:The military did not spend $1 billion on this ""new vehicle"" because it's not real. Concept artist Camille Kuo created the impressive artwork, although her signature appeared to be removed via Photoshop. The original ""track ball"" artwork with the signature is available on her ArtStation page:https://www.artstation.com/artwork/PVxDyKuo, who is from Taipei, Taiwan, told us that her artwork is available on image-licensing websites, which allows anyone who can pay the licensing fee the ability to use the artwork for commercial purposes.""That's why you see they are being used commercially without giving me credit,"" Kuo said. However, it's unclear if all of the advertisers and YouTube users that featured her artwork in thumbnails properly obtained licenses.For this piece, ""track ball,"" I emphasized the importance of being a tank without having traditional tank wheels. It can massively mash whatever comes through at the bottom, making pancakes. All of the work is done in Photoshop using the industry of concept art techniques called Photobash and 3DKitbash.She told us that it took around two to three hours to create, although ""the process of concepting the design takes the longest."" Kuo's other work can be viewed on her ArtStation page."	false
4699	User videos taken in November 2019 showed Facebook's mobile application inadvertently opening the phone's camera in the background.	In November 2019, some social media users reported their cameras were being opened in the background while they scrolled on the mobile Facebook application. One Twitter user, for instance, posted a video that supposedly showed the security/privacy issue:Found a @facebook #security & #privacy issue. When the app is open it actively uses the camera. I found a bug in the app that lets you see the camera open behind your feed. Note that I had the camera pointed at the carpet. pic.twitter.com/B8b9oE1nbl— Joshua Maddux (@JoshuaMaddux) November 10, 2019Another person on Twitter also found that his phone's rear camera (the selfie lens) was opened when he browsed on the mobile app:Facebook app on iOS 13.2.2 opens my phone’s rear camera when I open a profile photo swipe down to return (look at the little slit on the left of the video). Is this an app bug or an iOS bug?? @facebook @AppleSupport pic.twitter.com/WlhSXZulqx— Daryl Lasafin (@dzlasafin) November 10, 2019Several tech websites have since picked up on these tweets and have published reports on these privacy concerns.Here's a run-down of the issue from CNET:When you're scrolling through Facebook's app, the social network could be using your camera, concerned users have found. Multiple people have found and reported that their iPhone cameras were turned on in the background while they were looking at their feed.The issue came to light through several posts on Twitter. Users noted that their cameras were activated behind Facebook's app as they were watching videos or looking at photos on the social network.After people clicked on the video to full screen, returning it back to normal would create a bug in which Facebook's mobile layout was slightly shifted to the right. With the open space on the left, you could now see the phone's camera activated in the background.Guy Rosen, the vice president of integrity at Facebook, confirmed on Nov. 12, 2019, that there was indeed a bug on some versions of the Facebook iOS app that was causing the camera to inadvertently open. Rosen said Facebook found no evidence that any videos or photographs were uploaded due to this bug and said the company had submitted a fix to the app store:We recently discovered our iOS app incorrectly launched in landscape. In fixing that last week in v246 we inadvertently introduced a bug where the app partially navigates to the camera screen when a photo is tapped. We have no evidence of photos/videos uploaded due to this.	true
1540	First lady Jill Biden was a teenager working as the Biden family babysitter when she started dating President Joe Biden.	The story of how U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden met is a relatively simple one: They were set up on a blind date by the president's brother in March 1975. On social media, however, some users claim that the pair had a more sordid history. A February 2021 Facebook post, for instance, claimed that Jill was working as a babysitter for Joe and his family when the pair first met. This post falsely alleges that Jill was underage, and insinuates that their relationship began while Joe was still married to his first wife. Jill was not the Biden family babysitter, and she did not start dating Joe until she was in her 20s. The above-displayed photograph is genuine, but it does not show Jill at 15 years old. This photograph was posted to the first lady's own Instagram account in August 2020, and was accompanied by a caption that indicated that this picture was taken circa 1975. The Biden campaign dated the photo to 1976. At the time, Jill would have been approximately 24. Joe would have been about 33. Biden's first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, passed away in a car crash three years before this photograph was taken. The Bidens were married in 1977. A newspaper article published in the Delaware's The Morning News recounts the beginnings of their relationship. According to this report, the future first couple were set up on a blind date by Biden's brother Frank. Son told Joe to marry Jill Sun, Jul 17, 1977 – Page 3 · The Morning News (Wilmington, Delaware) · Newspapers.com	false
2457	A woman filed for divorce after noticing a detail in a family photograph.	"In general, it's certainly possible that some marriages have fallen apart over a revealing photograph. However, there's no truth to the viral stories on the same subject that appeared in online advertisements and YouTube videos.Since at least 2021, an online advertisement has claimed: ""Woman Files For Divorce After Seeing This Photo - Can You See Why?"" The ad showed a red circle that appeared to be pointing something out to readers. This ad was highly misleading.However, this was not a real story. We clicked on the ad. It led to a 77-page slideshow article on the website Sports Spotter. On the final page of the story, we found this disclaimer: ""This is a made-up story for entertainment purposes. All pictures shown are for illustration purposes only.""In the fictional story, a wife finds a picture that she believes shows her husband posing with another woman and two children. This leads her to think he is secretly living a second life with another family. She then believes she needs to file for divorce. In the end, the husband reveals that the photograph shows his twin brother, a person he never told her about. He provides proof to her. She believes him and they remain together.The red circle on the picture in the ad supposedly indicated that the twin brother was missing a finger. This was part of the way that the husband proved it wasn't him, but rather his twin brother. We found the same photograph on a stock photography website named iStockPhoto.com. Its name showed up as ""Happy Family Portrait.""https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/happy-family-portrait-gm118266284-10128670YouTube videos have also told variations of the same fictional tale. One video title read: ""Family takes photo, wife files for divorce after seeing this detail."" Another said: ""Woman Files For Divorce After Looking Closer At This Photo..Shocking!!"" We saw a video with a shorter title: ""Wife Looks Closer At Photo, Files For Divorce."" One even added a military twist: ""Marine Serving Our Country Filed For Divorce As Soon As He Saw This Photo His Wife Sent.""All of the videos used generic stock video, just as the 77-page article showed stock photography. Some of the YouTube videos even appeared to display a family picture that may have been improperly obtained from a photographer's website. We contacted the photographer and will update this story if we receive a response.In sum, the viral stories of ""woman files for divorce after seeing this photo"" were not true. While it's certainly possible that some revealing pictures have ended a number of real marriages in the past, there was no truth to the lengthy article or YouTube videos."	false
2664	"A lawyer in Texas was arrested for a prank in which he dressed up like the killer in the movie ""Halloween,"" Michael Myers, and roamed the beach in Galveston, Texas, ahead of a storm."	"It was a ""Halloween"" prank that went viral.Galveston, Texas-based, attorney Mark Metzger dressed up as the fictional killer Michael Myers from the ""Halloween"" horror series and wandered the beaches of the coastal city as a storm loomed.Houston TV news station KTRK reporter Mycah Hatfield spotted Metzger wandering the beach and posted a video to Twitter:Hatfield reported that Metzger's prank was short-lived. He was arrested by police, who stated that someone called to report a masked man carrying a bloody knife. Metzger was cited for disorderly conduct and released once officers determined the knife was fake, per Hatfield's reporting.Metzger posted about his adventure on social media, noting that his stunt had upset some. ""My methods might not work for everyone, but I guarantee I'll please more than I’ll piss off,"" he wrote.But he said it was worth it, in part because while in costume, he happened to meet Tom Araya, the lead singer of the thrash metal band Slayer."	true
5432	During the November 2018 midterm elections, Democrats were allowed to vote more than once at a polling place in Hagerstown, Maryland.	"The 2018 U.S. midterm elections were noteworthy not only for their unprecedented campaign spending and voter turnout, but for the concerted attempts by President Trump and his supporters to delegitimize their results before the vote counts could even be completed.While the votes were still being tallied, Trump tweeted baseless accusations of election ""stealing"" in Florida and Georgia as well as ""electoral corruption"" in Arizona. When the extremely narrow margins separating the results in Florida's U.S. Senate and gubernatorial races triggered a machine recount under state law, Trump demanded a halt to the recount, claiming that the ballots were ""massively infected"" and the Republican candidates should be declared the winners.Although no major problems or irregularities were reported in Maryland (whose early voting period ran from 25 October to 1 November), Trump supporter and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones promoted the claim that Democrats were voting twice at the polls there. In a widely-shared video of a 5 November call-in session posted by Jones on his website, Infowars, a caller claimed he overheard poll workers encouraging people who had already voted to vote a second time:﻿﻿﻿﻿JONES: Kevin in West Virginia, you're on the air, go ahead.CALLER: Hey, Alex. I hope you're having a great and wonderful day. I actually moved to Maryland and I had to vote in Maryland for the early election, or for early voting, and one thing that I witnessed -- people had already voted and they're letting them vote again. And this was in Hagerstown, Maryland. And I don't quite understand how they can do that.JONES: What were you seeing?CALLER: Well, I'm blind so I didn't see it. I could hear them saying, ‘Um, you know, oh, you voted yesterday but you can go ahead and recast your vote again today.' I mean, it's insane, and I wish I could have pulled my phone out or recorder at the time and got this on audio or something, because I usually carry a recorder ...JONES: Sure, I believe you, because they busted Democrats, it's funny, this year in Maryland and in Texas and all over doing the exact same type of crap. And it's always Democrats, because they have no morals. And what do you do when you're dealing with a group of criminals like this?Despite what was claimed in Infowars' headline (""Election Fraud: Democrats Are Voting Twice in Maryland""), the caller made no such assertion. ""Kevin in West Virginia"" (who actually said he lives in Maryland) claimed he overheard poll workers tell voters (whose party affiliation he did not specify) that they could ""recast"" their votes. It was Jones who added, without citing evidence: ""And it's always Democrats, because they have no morals.""Like Jones, the caller offered no evidence to substantiate his claims. Nor did we find reports or complaints of double voting or other election irregularities in local news coverage of the election. On 12 November, six days after the polls closed, Washington County Board of Elections Director Kaye Robucci told us she was unaware of election workers encouraging voters to vote twice in Hagerstown."	false

In early July 2020, readers searched the Snopes website to find out whether pop music star Taylor Swift had called for the Statue of Liberty in New York City to be removed. Swift said no such thing, and claims that she did appear to be a hoax.Some social media users shared an image that appears to show a doctored headline from Brazilian news outlet G1 containing the fake quote, along with a misspelled subheading:In Twitter and Instagram posts published on June 12, 2020, Swift criticized efforts to reinstate or protect monuments depicting Edward Carmack, a white newspaper editor who wrote pro-lynching editorials, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Klansman and Confederate general.""As a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things,"" Swift wrote. ""Edward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such.""Swift's comments came amid a widespread movement to remove monuments to racist historical figures, which followed nationwide protests against racism and police violence over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man whose death in the custody of Minneapolis police was filmed by a bystander and went viral, sparking outrage."	false
6287	"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg bought a ""super-yacht"" for $150 million."	"An English-language Turkish newspaper published — then quickly scrubbed — a 18 January 2018 story reporting that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had made an extravagant purchase in Monaco.According to the report, which ran in the Hurriyet Daily News, Zuckerberg secretly bought the ""super yacht,"" Ulysses, from a reclusive New Zealand businessman, Graeme Hart, for $150 million in October 2017.Though the sale itself was first reported by news outlets, the buyer was not announced. However, shortly after the story was published it was quickly debunked by a spokesperson for Zuckerberg:The reports related to Mark purchasing a yacht are completely inaccurate as he did not purchase a yacht.The spokesperson later added:Mark did not buy it, does not own a yacht and was not involved in the sale.But instead of updating or correcting its original reporting, the Hurriyet Daily News instead deleted it. However, some web sites continue to feature posts stating that the sale went through."	false
3608	Because U.S. President Donald Trump changed his legal residence to Mar-a-Lago in 2018, he committed voter fraud in either the 2018 midterm election, the 2020 presidential election, or both.	"On Sep. 27, 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump signed papers officially declaring Mar-a-Lago — a private club in Palm Beach, Florida, that he owns — to be his ""domicile,"" or official legal residence.""A couple of weeks'' ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018 election, according to former White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley, Trump voted absentee as a New Yorker, using the Trump Tower address that had been his primary residence since 1983 as his registered address. In the 2020 election, Trump voted early and in person as a resident of Palm Beach using his Mar-A-Lago address, despite the fact that Mar-a-Lago is a business and that a 1993 contract Trump signed stipulated that the property could not be considered a residence.Collectively, these facts have resulted in claims that Trump violated election law in either the 2018 election, the 2020 election, or both. For 2018, the argument is that Trump voted in New York despite declaring himself a resident of Florida before that election. For 2020, the argument is that Trump illegally voted in Florida because he used a business address as his residential address.Both claims lack merit. Trump's voting behavior in both 2018 and 2020 was legal under both state and federal election law.Despite changing his official residence prior to the 2018 midterm election, Trump met all of New York State's residency requirements to be a voter there. New York election law explicitly allows a person with multiple residences to pick one for voting purposes. Further, New York state law explicitly indicates that a voter's registration address does not have to be that person's declared ""domicile."" The New York Board of Elections allows for a broad interpretation of New York residency, and factors determining residency can include, in part, ""business pursuits,  and ""sites of personal and real property owned by the applicant."" For these reasons, and because he did not vote in any other jurisdiction in 2018, Trump did not commit voter fraud, despite changing his domicile from New York to Florida prior to voting.Also, despite the fact that Trump is in a legal fight with his Florida neighbors and local government over his residency there, Trump broke no Florida election law by voting from that address. It is true that Trump in the early 1990s he signed a contract that re-zoned Mar-a-Lago as a business and stipulated that the property could not be used as a single family home. However, though Trump may be violating local zoning laws, Florida, like New York, allows for broad interpretation of residency. The Florida elections handbook explicitly states (emphasis ours) that ""a business address is not typically a satisfactory legal residential address but if the person resides there despite the zoning ordinance, the address could become the person’s legal residential address."" Trump regularly resides there and has indicated he plans to continue to do so in spite of any zoning ordinance issue. For that reason, and because he did not vote in any other jurisdiction in 2020, Trump did not commit voter fraud when he voted using his Mar-a-Lago address in 2020."	false
4537	News reports used photographs taken in a different time or place to illustrate articles about the opening of Jacksonville beaches in April 2020.	"The post-Easter weekend of April 17-19, 2020, fell in the midst of both the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and a public controversy over whether social-distancing rules should be relaxed and some public facilities (such as beaches) reopened to public use, if only on a limited basis:As a divide appeared to deepen between Americans who want to reopen the country and those who urge continuing social distancing to slow the spread of coronavirus, one microcosm of the debate centered on some newly reopened Florida beaches.Despite the fact that bustling stores, trails and parks don’t seem to evoke the same level of outrage among stay-at-home advocates, enough social media users were upset by beaches reopening in the Jacksonville area that the #FloridaMorons hashtag started trending on Twitter late Friday and early Saturday.Some Twitter users said they feared the reopenings would lead to crowds and an uptick in cases that could extend quarantine durations. They criticized the government officials who made the decision as well as the residents and visitors who went to the beach.Others spoke out in support of the beach reopenings, some of them saying Floridians need fresh air and exercise, and others stating that grocery store shoppers are closer to each other than the beachgoers have been so far.The news reporting on that controversy caused a controversy of its own, however. Some social media users asserted that photographs showing crowds of beach-goers in Jacksonville that were used to illustrate news articles were simply stock photos or unrelated pictures that did not reflect the reality of the situation:Although it's possible a photograph of Jacksonville beaches from the weekend of April 17-19, 2020, might have been inappropriately used somewhere to illustrate a story about a different part of the U.S. (such as California), the pictures seen here are correctly represented as to time and place (i.e., taken in Jacksonville in mid-April 2020). Here are those photographs and their accompanying captions, as stored in the database of the Getty Images visual media company: JACKSONVILLE BEACH, FLORIDA - APRIL 17: People are seen at the beach on April 17, 2020 in Jacksonville Beach, Florida. Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry announced Thursday that Duval County's beaches would open at 5 p.m. but only for restricted hours and can only be used for swimming, running, surfing, walking, biking, fishing, and taking care of pets.

Jacksonville Beach became the first beach in the country to reopen. (Photo by David Rosenblum/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) 
It is true, though, that as demonstrated in the following Facebook post, factors such as camera positioning, angle, and lens type can substantially affect the viewer's perception of how far apart pictured objects are, so a beach that looks crowded in one photo may appear sparsely populated in another:"	false
5506	A 97-year-old victim of an October 2018 synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh was a Holocaust survivor.	"On the morning of 27 October 2018, a gunman killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the deadliest attack ever on Jews in the United States.  Police took a 46-year-old man named Robert Bowers into custody in connection with the massacre, whom law enforcement officials said had targeted Jews online and made anti-Semitic comments during the shooting.News outlets ran profiles of the victims of the mass shooting, one of whom was a 97-year-old woman named Rose Mallinger, who was said to have attended the synagogue 'almost without fail' for decades':
When Chuck Diamond, a former rabbi at Tree of Life, heard that a gunman had opened fire inside the synagogue, Rose Mallinger was among the first he worried about.The petite 97-year-old he regularly saw walking in the neighborhood or grocery shopping had attended service for decades, almost without fail, and was always among the first to walk in.“She was a synagogue-goer, and not everybody is. She’s gone to the synagogue for a lifetime, no matter how many people are there,” Diamond said.
Shortly afterwards, some news accounts and commenters on the tragedy began adding a note of irony to the sorrow by asserting that Rose Mallinger was a Holocaust survivor.  For example, one popular social media post sadly asserted: ""A 97 year-old Holocaust survivor was killed for being Jewish yesterday. In the United States. Let that sink in.""However, although Rose Mallinger may have lived through the Holocaust in a temporal sense, she wasn't a ""survivor"" of that genocide in the sense of having been in the custody of those who perpetrated it or present in any of the areas where it took place, as noted in more thorough news reporting on her life:
At 97, Rose Mallinger was the eldest of the 11 victims murdered in the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation synagogue in Squirrel Hills, Pennsylvania allegedly perpetrated by avowed anti-Semite Robert Bowers, now charged federally and facing life in prison. The youngest victim was age 54. Seven of the 11 killed were alive during the Second World War and the Holocaust.Mallinger was not a Holocaust survivor as was incorrectly reported Sunday by a number of news outlets. But she was in many ways a survivor having lived through it and on this earth for nearly a century before being shot with what was likely a semi-automatic rifle by the 46-year-old Pennsylvania man who confessed to police, which can be heard on the police scanner, that he set out to kill Jewish people. That was his mission. And that he would take the lives of very elderly Jews for some makes the horror all the more unfathomable.It’s the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in recent U.S. history. Bowers yelled ‘All Jews must die’ as he allegedly fired on unarmed elders including Mallinger during Sabbath services on Saturday.
And People magazine, for example, updated their initial list of the victims to note that ""This article originally incorrectly identified Rose Mallinger as a Holocaust survivor.""Others with a personal connection to Rose exhorted the public to stop spreading misinformation about her:According to other reports, however, one Holocaust survivor did narrowly escape being caught up in the mass shooting because he was a few minutes late to synagogue that day:
Judah Samet was four minutes late to synagogue.Services at Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh start at 9:45 A.M. Samet, who is 80 years old, pulled into a handicapped spot in front of the building on the morning of October 27 at 9:49.“Somebody knocked on my window,” Samet said. “There was this guy. Very calm and respectful. [He] told me, you better back up, there is an active shooting going on in your synagogue.”It took Samet sixty seconds to process what the man was saying. Samet was born in Hungary. He turned eight years old at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. He spent five and a half years in an orphanage in Israel. He has been a member of Tree of Life Congregation for fifty-five years.“My God, my story doesn’t end,” he said."	false

Steve Austin on the set of a 1976 episode of ""The Six Million Dollar Man."" André appeared as Bigfoot in a two-part episode of ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" called ""The Secret of Bigfoot."" Author Michael Krugman writes in his 2009 book ""Andre the Giant: A Legendary Life"" that this was the iconic wrestler's acting debut:It was inevitable that Hollywood would come a-calling. In early 1976 Andre made his acting debut on the hugely popular sci-fi series The Six Million Dollar Man. When the show decided to capitalize on the craze surrounding Sasquatch sightings, the creative team knew there was really only one man who could realistically portray the eight-foot-tall forest creature.[...][Director Kenneth] Johnson remembers Andre as being both reticent and respectful while filming the episodes. ""He was a very shy, sweet guy. It was probably one of the first film things that he had ever done, so he was completely bewildered about the whole process. But he was also very , very friendly and anxious to please. When I met him at the trailer on the set and walked him out, there was a big of a look of a frightened puppy in his eyes, which is amusing when you think of the mass that the guy represents ... You get stared at a lot when you're that kind of guy, and I had a conversation with the cast and crew ahead of time to encourage them to be friendly and outgoing and make him as comfortable as he possibly could be, since it was his virgin effort in the film business.""Hidden under prosthetic makeup and a fur-covered bodysuit, Andre battled seven-figure cyborg Steve Austin in a memorable fight scene that took advantage of the Giant's grappling skills. While he might have yet lacked confidence as an actor, Andre was more than comfortable engaging in stage fisticuff with actor Lee Majors.While the photo of André the Giant as Bigfoot is real, this version of Bigfoot on the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" wasn't your average mythical beast. It's revealed in the episode (45-year spoiler alert!) that the Bigfoot portrayed by André the Giant was actually a robot built by aliens. Majors' character makes this discovery while grappling with the beast. Here's a clip from this memorable moment:"	true
4313	“Antifa” posted an ad on the Lincoln, Nebraska, Craigslist website offering to pay protesters “to cause as much chaos and destruction as possible.”	On June 1, 2020, the white nationalist group Identity Evropa was revealed to have been behind a hoax tweet suggesting that members of “antifa” — a diffuse movement that sometimes advocates radical methods to oppose what they view as fascism — were gearing up to cause trouble for America. Amid unrest and demonstrations following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, while in the custody of Minneapolis police, antifa — according to this white nationalist hoax — were coming to sow chaos and violence across small towns in America.Despite reports indicating that antifa has had at most a negligible influence at any of the thousands of anti-police-brutality demonstrations, the movement has been elevated by some on the right, including President Donald Trump, as a symbol of left-wing anarchy and terror, creating a national, if not ill-defined, boogeyman on which to blame the country’s unrest. As a result, panic about marauding bands of “antifa” infiltrating small towns across America to cause terror became an ubiquitous feature of social media rumors and forwarded emails in June 2020.One notable panic occurred thanks to a screenshot of a purported Craigslist ad claiming to have been authored by “ANTIFA” and offering to pay “up to 1,000 people $25 per hour for protesters in Lincoln, NE and Omaha, NE.” In unusual candor for a supposedly anonymous and shadowy political movement, the ad continued to explain that “basically we want to cause as much chaos and destruction as possible.” First things first: Yes, the screenshots are of a real ad that was posted, briefly, to Craigslist. By combining multiple screenshots of the ad, each of which included incomplete portions of its URL, we were able to reconstruct its one-time location on the web:As of this writing, that URL goes to a live page that indicates a post once existed, but that it had “been flagged for removal.”Based on several pieces of information, we infer that the ad was live for less than a day, having been both posted and removed on June 1, 2020. Our evidence for this assertion stems from the fact that the earliest screenshot of the ad — according to reverse-image searches —  is found on a post in the message board community Godlike Productions created on June 1. Further, there are no relevant search results for “antifa,” “craigslist,” and “Nebraska” before June 1 on either Google or the social media analytics tool Crowdtangle.Thanks to the message board posting, we also know that the ad had to have been deleted at some point before 5:58 p.m. EDT on June 1. The author states that “My friend sent me [this Craigslist ad] on Facebook. I searched for the Craigslist ad, and it isn't there anymore.”The timing is crucial. The point of this ad, allegedly, was to recruit people to create “as much chaos and destruction as possible.” It is true that there was some “chaos and destruction” in Lincoln and Omaha in the aftermath of the Floyd killing, but almost all of it occurred before June 1. In both Lincoln and Omaha, demonstrations turned violent and included looting on several nights prior to and including May 31. Since then, however, demonstrations remained largely peaceful in both cities. A majority of the arrests since then were for breaking the curfew, not for property damage or theft.If there was a serious effort by persons connected to antifa to recruit agitators to sow chaos in Lincoln and Omaha with this Craigslist ad, their effort bore no fruit. By way of another explanation, fake Craigslist ads are a tragically common form of online manipulation — anyone can claim they are whoever they want, and this allows them to impersonate people they want to cast in whatever light they choose. The lack of actual chaos and violence following the Craigslist ad, combined with the comically candid assertion that “basically we [antifa] want to cause as much chaos and destruction as possible,” strongly suggests it was a hoax.Other evidence in favor of this being an inauthentic posting comes from two demonstrably different sources: the Lincoln Police Department and an organization named “Anti-Fascist Action Nebraska” — the latter appears to legitimately represent the Nebraska anti-fascist movement based on past reporting of their activism.On June 3, according to the Journal Star, “Officer Erin Spilker said Lincoln Police are aware of the online rumor and are investigating its authenticity — but have found no indication that it's real.” As for Anti-Fascist Action Nebraska, they, too, have denied any involvement in its creation, calling it a hoax. In a tweet, they described the Craigslist ad as “bullshit,” adding that “you're a gullible mark with questionable motives if you believe everything you see on the internet”Because the post existed for less than a day, was created after the most significant unrest and violence in Omaha and Lincoln occurred, and went viral only in screenshot form in predominantly right-wing circles well after its deletion, we conclude that this is just another one of the thousands of viral but wholly inauthentic Craigslist ads floating around on the internet. The denial from Anti-Fascist Action Nebraska and the skepticism of the Lincoln Police Department further support that conclusion.	false
1093	"The producer on ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" had to hire a CIA torture expert to help Jim Carrey endure the makeup and costumes of the titular character."	"Some movies require extreme levels of training from their actors, but the 2000 film ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" took this to a surprising level. Lead actor and comedian Jim Carrey reportedly had to endure so much makeup, costuming, and prosthetics to play the role of the furry green Grinch that he told his director and producer he couldn't take it anymore. Their solution? Hire a CIA expert in torture resistance to train him.According to the Twitter post below: ""The CIA trained Jim Carrey to withstand torture in order to endure the make-up process for 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' (2000).""The man brought in was described by the producer of the film as more of a ""CIA specialist"" who trained spies. Carrey himself recounted this story in an interview with television host Graham Norton several years ago, adding that the makeup was put on him around 100 times, and on the first day it took roughly eight hours: According to Carrey: ""Literally the makeup was like being buried alive everyday. [...] I went back to my trailer and put my leg through the wall, and I told [director] Ron Howard I couldn't do the movie. Then [producer] Brian Grazer came in, and being the fix-it man, came up with a brilliant idea to hire a gentleman who is trained to teach CIA operatives how to endure torture. And so that's how I got through 'The Grinch.'"" He elaborated on the techniques he learnt to withstand wearing the makeup: ""[The expert] said eat everything you see and if you are freaking out and you start to spiral downward, turn the television on, change your pattern, have someone you know come up and smack you in the head, punch yourself in the leg, or smoke, smoke as much as you possibly can."" Grazer, the producer behind the film, also recounted the experience in a story for The Daily Beast: I have a particular curiosity about the world of intelligence, spies, terrorism, and counter-terrorism. As we were frantically trying to fix our Grinch problem, a curiosity conversation I'd had suddenly popped to mind. One of the CIA people I'd talked to years before specialized in training U.S. agents to survive torture if they were captured.We had an actor being held prisoner by his costume—he was being tortured by his makeup. Maybe the CIA specialist could teach Jim Carrey to survive the green Grinch makeup the way he'd taught spies to survive hostile interrogation?We flew the CIA specialist in on a Friday, and he spent the whole weekend closeted with Jim. He taught Jim all kinds of techniques for distracting himself, for creating mindsets that allowed him to ignore and work through the discomfort.Years later, Jim described those sessions as ""quite hilarious."" But they worked. Jim came back to the set, he put on the Grinch makeup 100 times— every day for months. ""I just kept telling myself, 'It's for the kids! It's for the kids!'"""	true
1791	Essential oils can be poisonous to pets.	"A Michigan woman's online account of her family cat's brush with eucalyptus oil used in a diffuser spurred concern among fellow pet lovers on social media — and experts say those worries have some truth to them.Sue Murray said in her 7 January 2018 post that she had unwittingly poisoned the cat, Ernie, by using a diffuser in her house with eucalyptus oil to alleviate her head cold. She said:The first couple days I didn't notice any symptoms with Ernie, but on the fourth day, he was lethargic, unstable on his feet and was drooling excessively. My husband instinctively Googled eucalyptus oil. It stated that it can be toxic to cats and they can't metabolize it and stated all of Ernie's symptoms. It also said that without medical attention, it could be fatal! So I took him to the Vet right away!The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) lists essential oils like eucalyptus, orange and lemon (among others) as being among the leading causes for tremors among cats. The group also has warnings on its website for products that may contain essential oils.According to Tina Wismer, the medical director for the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, cats exposed to essential oils can absorb it through their skin or orally. In some cases, she said, owners inadvertently put them at risk by applying substances with a high concentration of essential oils on their cats while trying to treat other problems, such as an open wound or ear mites:Most of the problems are seen when owners apply 100-percent essential oil [products]. There's some essential oils used for flea control are typically less than 5 percent. So that's a big difference.Before using products containing essential oils on their pets, she said, owners should make sure that they are labeled for use with that specific species:We don't want to use dog products on cats. Cats are special. They don't have a whole lot of metabolyzing enzymes in their liver unlike other animals, so they're a lot more sensitive to a lot of toxins.Owners using diffusers like Murray did, Wismer explained, should move their cats to another room while doing so and avoid using the device for extended periods of time in order to minimize the risk that oil droplets could get onto their fur. The most common symptoms for cats exposed to essential oils, she said, were drooling, vomiting, coughing, and sneezing.While any animal can potentially have an issue with oils spread by diffusers, she said, birds are even more susceptible than cats:Birds have a very different respiratory system than mammals do, and it's very sensitive to inhaled toxins. We've had birds [affected by] new carpet in the house, or teflon pans. A lot of different ways.Another post circulating online in February 2018 described a dog owner's account of her pooch's ""acting weird"" after being exposed to essential oils:We asked Wismer about this case as well, and she told us:All pet owners should be careful about exposing their animals to essential oils. Generally speaking, cats have more sensitivity to many toxins, including essential oils, than dogs do, because they have fewer metabolizing enzymes in their liver. With that said, dogs can develop the same symptoms as cats, including drooling, vomiting, sneezing, and coughing, and dogs with prior respiratory conditions can be particularly at risk for more serious effects."	true
4211	Shaquille Marshon Francis, charged in the murder of Aaliyah Norris, was released from jail in an unrelated case some three hours before her shooting.	"In the summer of 2020, we received several inquiries from readers about the accuracy of reports that claimed a man charged with murdering 7-year-old Aaliyah Norris, in Forest City, North Carolina, had been arrested and then released on bail, just hours before the fatal shooting.On June 26, for example, People magazine published an article with the headline ""7-Year-Old N.C. Girl is Fatally Shot, Allegedly by Man Who Was Released From Jail Hours Earlier."" The article reported that:""A 7-year-old North Carolina girl was fatally shot in the head while sitting in a car eating ice cream. 'We just lost a 7-year-old innocent child in our family for no reason,' Kenneth Woods, a relative of Aaliyah Norris told WLOS at a memorial for the girl Thursday night. Aaliyah was sitting in a car in Forest City when she was shot in the head. She was taken to a local hospital, where she remained on life support until succumbing to her injuries two days later, according to a Forest City police news release obtained by PEOPLE.""On Wednesday, Shaquille Marshon Francis, 26, was arrested and charged with murder. Francis was arrested earlier on Tuesday for assault by pointing a gun, according to arrest records obtained by WLOS. However, he bonded himself out and three hours later, he allegedly shot Aaliyah.""Daily Mail and New York Post also published articles that similarly claimed Francis had been arrested and released on bail just three hours before the fatal shooting of Norris. Local television news channel WLOS earlier reported that:""Forest City Police Chief Chris LeRoy confirmed that 26-year-old Shaquille Francis was released from jail on unrelated charges three hours before he is accused of shooting 7-year-old Aaliyah Norris in the head. 'He was arrested at some point, I don’t know if it was yesterday or not. He was released from custody after noon for some unrelated charges,' LeRoy said.""Rutherford County arrest records show Francis had been arrested the day of the shooting for assault by pointing a gun. Records also indicated he was given no bond. LeRoy said at some point the bond decision changed, and Francis was able to bond himself out.""There appears to have been some confusion over the timing of Francis's initial arrest, and the circumstances surrounding his release. However, all the articles mentioned above accurately reported the following key claim: that Francis, who has been charged with shooting Norris dead, was released from jail, on bail, just three hours before her fatal shooting took place. According to an arrest report obtained by Snopes, a patrol officer from the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office executed an arrest warrant for Francis at 8:18 p.m. on June 22, on a charge of ""assault by pointing a gun."" The details of that charge were not included in the arrest report. A media report published by the Rutherford County Sheriff's office mistakenly stated that Francis had initially been arrested on June 23 — in fact, he was arrested the evening before, and spent that night in the Rutherford County Jail.An officer at Rutherford County Jail told Snopes that Francis was also arrested on charges of driving on a revoked license and driving without a motorcycle endorsement. A bondsman paid his $5,000 bail bond, and he was released at 2:23 p.m. on June 23. At 6:09 p.m. that evening, Forest City Police Department (PD) issued a statement saying it was investigating a shooting that took place around 5 p.m., at the intersection of Oak and Harmon streets in Forest City. According to that initial statement, ""the suspects fled the scene in a black SUV"" and ""one victim was flown to Spartanburg [Regional Medical Center, South Carolina].""That victim was 7-year-old Aaliyah Norris, who had suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, and remained in critical condition on June 23 and 24. According to Forest City Police Department, Francis was arrested without incident on the morning of June 24, and charged with ""assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury with intent to kill, discharging a weapon into occupied property inflicting serious bodily injury, and discharging a firearm within the city limits.""An officer at the county jail told Snopes that Francis was booked in at 9:46 a.m. that morning. Norris died on June 25. At that time, Francis was additionally charged with felony murder, with a bond of $10 million. As of July 8, he remained in the Rutherford County Jail, charged with: assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury with intent to kill; discharging a weapon into occupied property inflicting serious bodily injury; discharging a firearm within the city limits; murder; and four related probation violations. He is due in court on July 15 to answer the charge of murder, and on July 13, to answer the other charges against him. Although Francis has not been tried or convicted on any of the aforementioned charges as of this writing, the news articles mentioned above did accurately report the fact that he has been charged with fatally shooting Norris, and that, less than three hours before the shooting, Francis was released on bail. "	true
3139	A photograph shows a double rainbow over the U.S. Capitol.	In April 2021, a photograph was widely circulated on social media that supposedly showed a double rainbow arching over the U.S. Capitol. While many viewers were impressed with the natural symmetry of the photo (the rainbows appear to perfectly frame the building), others claimed that this image was obviously digitally manipulated:This is a genuine photograph that was taken by Carissa Bunge, a senior legislative assistant at the U.S. House of Representatives. While some viewers were skeptical of this image, there truly was a double rainbow over Washington, D.C., on the evening of April 11, 2021. Another amateur photographer, Instagram user Kendy Garden, posted a very similar image to their Instagram page:The Capitol Weather Gang, The Washington Post's D.C.-based weather account on Twitter, collected several other images of these rainbows around the capitol. Meteorologist Matthew Cappucci wrote in The Washington Post that the above-displayed rainbow was a supernumerary bow, which means that it had faint, secondary arches of color inside the inner rim of the primary rainbow. Cappucci writes: Observers in and around D.C. noticed some additional colors inside the primary arc during Sunday’s show, too — with up to three repeating bands of colors packing the inner rim of the rainbow. Sunday’s rainbow was a “supernumerary” bow, and formed thanks to a high number of smaller raindrops present in the atmosphere.When two beams of sunlight enter a raindrop, even though they’re parallel when they enter, they strike the back edge of the raindrop in slightly different places, and subsequently are bounced in acutely different directions when they exit. For an individual color, which is composed of a wavelength of alternating crests and troughs, that means the two light beams may no longer overlap “in phase.”	true
3578	Fast food chain KFC developed a video game console that also keeps chicken warm.	"Have you ever gotten so hungry playing a video game that you wish you could just eat whatever was inside your video game console?In 2020, fast food chain KFC added another memorable marketing stunt to its end-of-year blitz. First it was a KFC-themed mini-soap opera titled, ""A Recipe for Seduction."" Now it's KFConsole, a video game console with a storage area that keeps snacks (chicken) warm.The idea was initially floated on Twitter in June 2020 when the account for KFC Gaming (which is a thing, no doubt, because it's 2020) posted a video that showed a grill-like device inside a bucket-shaped console. People expressed skepticism. Is it a marketing stunt, or a real gaming console set to be mass-produced for KFC-loving gamers everywhere?Then on Dec. 22, 2020, Mark Walton, a spokesman for Intel, assured the wary, ""Yes it's real. Yes, it's powered by Intel. And yes, it has a chicken warmer.""The chicken-warming gaming console resulted from a collaboration between KFC and computer hardware manufacturer Cooler Master, and Cooler Master's announcement about the device comes with some specs, but no details about when it would be available to the public or what games would be playable on it. Cooler Master said the food in the chamber would kept warm by the gaming console's own heat and airflow system. The announcement also suggests that the so-called ""Chicken Chamber"" is a patented invention. Via Twitter, we reached out to Cooler Master about the existence of this patent, but have not received a response.On the one hand, a Chicken Chamber-enhanced gaming console produced by a fast food chicken company is an objectively absurd concept. On the other hand, Mario Lopez — in character as a young Col. Sanders —  once uttered the words ""don't call me crouton"" in a Lifetime channel mini-soap opera produced by that same fast food chicken company. Because the product has not been released, all we have to go on are public statements made by the companies allegedly involved in the project: KFC, Cooler Master, Intel, ASUS, and Seagate.KFC's corporate office released a news release on Dec. 22, 2020 as part of ""the official launch of the KFConsole in partnership with Cooler Master."" A spokesperson for Cooler Master, which hosts the landing page for the KFConsole product, is also quoted in the news release as saying the company ""jumped at the chance to get involved and enter the console war."" In addition to the tweet from their spokesperson Walton, Intel told CNN that they had nothing to add to the details provided by KFC and Cooler Master. Snopes reached out to both ASUS and Seagate for comment, but received no response."	true

Another person asked, ""Is this true?"" It's unclear when ""Euphoria"" might return to HBO for its third season. While several websites have appeared to speculate regarding when production might begin, there has been no official word regarding a future release date. Some Google search results might show specific months and years for when season three might arrive, whether that be in 2023 or 2024.

Basically, just because something shows up at the top of Google search results doesn't mean it's true."	false
1334	Betsy Ross was the only real person ever depicted on a PEZ candy dispenser.	"In 2002, a Snopes reader emailed with the question, ""Is it true that Betsy Ross was the only real person to be a 'Pez Head'?No, that claim was not true. Let us explain.PEZ began in 1927 as an Austrian manufacturer and vendor of compressed peppermint tablets (hence its name, taken from ""Pfefferminz,"" the German word for “peppermint”). Now, of course, PEZ is an international business known not just for its fruit-flavored candy tablets, but for the ubiquitous, brightly-colored molded plastic dispensers sold with them.Initially, PEZ dispensers resembled cigarette lighters, befitting PEZ’s market position as a breath mint for adult smokers rather than a candy. When PEZ inventor Edward Haas brought his product to the American market in 1952, sales were less than encouraging, so he made a couple of key changes intended to appeal to children: PEZ became fruit-flavored (cherry, lemon, orange and strawberry), and the dispensers were topped with the heads of cartoon characters, animals, circus figures, and other kiddie favorites. PEZ thus became more than just a candy company: they were transformed into a de facto manufacturer of specialized toys — toys purchased not only by candy-gulping children, but avidly sought after by collectors of all ages.Over the years, PEZ dispensers have been fashioned after a wide variety of cartoon characters (Bugs Bunny, Peanuts, the Flintstones, etc.), comic book superheroes (Batman, Spider Man, etc.), movie favorites (such as Star Wars), and various animals.Rarely have PEZ dispensers featured real people, however; when humans have been depicted, they have generally been either fictional characters (such as Santa Claus) or generic representations of roles (such as a fireman or pilot). The initial exceptions came in 1976, when PEZ distributed a special series of nine dispensers based on an American history theme to coincide with the bicentennial of the United States.The bicentennial PEZ dispensers were also primarily generic representations of types (such as ""Indian chief"" and ""wounded soldier"") and fictional characters (""Uncle Sam""). But despite what was claimed in a popular trivia item afterwards, the series also included dispensers representing not just one, but three real people: legendary flag-maker Betsy Ross, frontiersman Daniel Boone, and celebrated Revolutionary War figure Paul Revere. (The Paul Revere figure was simply designated “captain,” so it was often overlooked as one of the few “real person” dispensers)."	false
252	Onions placed in bowls around your home will fight off the flu virus.	"Although influenza is no longer the unchecked grim reaper of years past (in 1918 it killed half a million Americans and twenty to forty million folks worldwide), it continues to present a very real danger even in these more modern times. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), millions of people in the United States (about 10% to 20% of U.S. residents) will get the flu each year. Influenza also costs Americans $10 billion annually in lost wages and medical expenses. Worst of all, every year about 36,000 people in the United States die from it, and 114,000 have to be admitted to the hospital because of it. The flu is not just a week of feeling lousy and missing work; it is a disease that can and does kill.The 2009 outbreak of H1N1 (swine) flu brought home even to those who didn't normally ponder such matters the danger posed by contagions dismissively regarded in other years as mere seasonal flu, maladies that are thought of as wholly unpleasant but not life threatening. In 2009, people became more aware of the sniffles and sneezes around them. Also, unlike in other years, more folks were actively looking for ways to avoid catching the flu — including by unconventional means, such as those referenced in the following message:Onions, for collecting the flu virus:In 1919 when the flu killed 40 million people there was this Doctor that visited the many farmers to see if he could help them combat the flu. Many of the farmers and their family had contracted it and many died.The doctor came upon this one farmer and to his surprise, everyone was very healthy. When the doctor asked what the farmer was doing that was different the wife replied that she had placed an unpeeled onion in a dish in the rooms of the home, (probably only two rooms back then). The doctor couldn't believe it and asked if he could have one of the onions and placed it under the microscope. She gave him one and when he did this, he did find the flu virus in the onion. It obviously absorbed the virus,
therefore, keeping the family healthy.Now, I heard this story from my hairdresser in AZ. She said that several years ago many of her employees were coming down with the flu and so were many of her customers. The next year she placed several bowls with onions around in her shop. To her surprise, none of her staff got sick. It must work.. (And no, she is not in the onion business.)The moral of the story is, buy some onions and place them in bowls around your home. If you work at a desk, place one or two in your office or under your desk or even on top somewhere. Try it and see what happens. We did it last year and we never got the flu.If this helps you and your loved ones from getting sick, all the better. If you do get the flu, it just might be a mild case..Whatever, what have you to lose? Just a few bucks on onions!In addition to the good advice about washing one's hands frequently and avoiding the company of those who are obviously under the weather, those looking to sidestep being felled by the flu are subject to toutings of a variety of folk remedies, each of which is presented as a surefire and deadly preventive. The missive quoted above about onions absorbing the virus is one such offering.There's no medical magic to placing peeled or cut onions around the home: they don't act as sponges that soak up whatever viruses or other nasty microbes are in their immediate vicinity. However, the belief that they would act in this fashion predates the 2009 flu outbreak by at least 100 years. Long-standing superstition asserts that keeping raw onions in the house (either cut or whole; different folks swear by different methods) will draw illness-causing germs from the air, thereby rendering the home free of contamination. The following print references gathered by folklorists Iona Opie and Moira Tatum showcase that belief:The onion is cut up and stood in an old tin-plate. Then you place it in the room where the sick child sleeps. The onion draws the complaint into itself, and when the child is better care must be taken to see that the onion is properly burnt.When there's flu about, I puts a plate of cut up onion in every room. That's what keeps colds away ... All the cold germs goes into they.I fondly remember the smell of my mother's window sill adorned with half onions. She swore by the legend that the onions captured any incoming germs and purified the air.Even older print sightings exist, however. One of the earliest we've located (from 1900) calls the practice ""an old custom,"" which means even at that early date, the belief's origins were lost in the mists of time:[Chambers' Journal, 1900]In remote country villages one sometimes sees an old custom which, in its essence, is wise, though the performers do not know its why or wherefore; as their forbears did, so do they. This is to place plates full of sliced onion at the side of any bed or coffin wherein lies the body of a person dead of infections [sic] disease. This good and shrewd practice was based on the observation of the blackening of the onion and practical experience of the usefulness of the habit, not on scientific knowledge. But the floating germs were attracted to that blackening onion, and settled on thickly, the result being the onion's discoloration and the great purification of the air in the death-chamber. The story is true of a house wherein ropes of onions intended for sale were hung escaping a smallpox epidemic, which attacked the neighbouring houses.[Los Angeles Times, 1913]In a sickroom you cannot have a better disinfectant than the onion. It has a wonderful capacity for absorbing germs. A dish of sliced onions placed in a sickroom will draw away the disease; they must be removed as soon as they lose their odor and become discolored, and be replaced by fresh ones.[The Chicago Defender, 1922]In remote villages the old custom still exists of placing a plate full of sliced onion beside the bed or coffin of any persons who had died of an infectious disease. Although those who follow this practice cannot explain it, the fact is that the raw onion destroys germs and purifies the infected air of the death chamber.Some people insist plates of sliced raw onion should be left at various points around the home; others avow that whole onions must be hung on strings affixed to the domicile's ceilings, some further asserting the bulbs must be hung in front of doorways to better filter incoming contamination. As to what sorts of contamination the onion is purported to overcome, at various times it has been said to kill flu virus, diphtheria, smallpox, the cold virus, and even whatever nastiness a rotting corpse might be venting into the air, especially one that reached that condition via infectious disease of any description. Onions are also, according to lore, to be placed in any sickroom no matter how that room's occupant came to require bedrest.While this folk belief is indeed an old one, there's precious little reason to place any store in it. No scientific studies back it, and common sense rules it out: cold and flu viruses are spread by contact, not by their nasty microbes floating loosely in the air where the almighty onion can supposedly seek out and destroy them. As the Wall Street Journal noted in 2009 of such claims:Biologists say it's highly implausible that onions could attract flu virus as a bug zapper traps flies. Viruses require a living host to replicate and can't propel themselves out of a body and across a room.The idea that onions have medicinal properties goes back millennia and spans many cultures. Egyptians thought onions were fertility symbols. Ancient Greeks rubbed them on sore muscles, and Native Americans used them to treat coughs and colds. Herbalists note that the World Health Organization recognizes onion extracts for providing relief in the treatment of coughs, colds, asthma and bronchitis. As with most home remedies, there have been few scientific studies with humans — and none on record involving raw onions placed across a room.Furthermore, for those who believe in folk claims, superstition also asserts that it is unlucky to keep cut onions around, as demonstrated in these additional examples gathered by Opie and Tatum:[1855]To have a cut onion lying about in the house breeds distempers.[1891]An old servant (Essex) ... recently complained that ... Spanish onions ... were too big. When an obvious method of getting over that difficulty was suggested, she replied, 'Oh, no! that would never do! It's so unlucky to have a cut onion in the house.'[1958]Special small onions are being grown for me as I am liable to keep half a cut onion from one meal to another, which I am assured is highly dangerous.Onions — cut, peeled, or otherwise — aren't going to secure your living space from the flu virus, either 2009's swine version or any other year's contagion. Instead, if you want to stay healthy, wash your hands and avoid being around sick people."	false
3562	Some Hampton Bay ceiling fans sold exclusively by Home Depot were recalled by King of Fans, Inc. after consumers reported that the fan blades had detached while in operation.	"Perhaps the last thing that people need to worry about after a year as tumultuous as 2020 is a ceiling fan blade flying across the room. However, a handful of consumers had dealt with that very problem beginning no earlier than April 2020. The New York Times and other news organizations reported on a ceiling fan recall that was issued two days before Christmas. On Dec. 23, King of Fans, Inc. announced the recall of the ""Hampton Bay 54-inch Mara Indoor/Outdoor Ceiling Fans"" product line. The recalled ceiling fans were sold exclusively by The Home Depot.The New York Times reported that there had been at least 47 consumer reports of the product dangerously malfunctioning:There have been 47 reports of blades detaching from the fans. Two of those episodes involved the detached blades hitting people, and there have been four reports of the blades causing property damage.It was unclear if the people hit by the blades had been injured.""We're committed to the safety and quality of our products so we contacted the Consumer Product Safety Commission and voluntarily recalled the product and stopped sales when we discovered the issue,"" a Home Depot spokeswoman, Christina Cornell, said.Recalled models of the ceiling fans sold at The Home Depot included the Matte White Ceiling Fans with Light and Remote Control (Model #51918), Matte Black Ceiling Fan with Light and Remote Control (Model #51919), Black Ceiling Fan with Light and Remote Control - Online Only (Model #59919), and Polished Nickel Ceiling Fan with Light and Remote Control - Online Only (Model #51918).

30	"A video provides evidence that shows Mel Gibson exposed Oprah Winfrey regarding a ""questionable action for Hollywood elites."""	"In July 2023, a purported celebrity news YouTube channel known as Just In (@JustInCeleb) published a new video that claimed film actor and director Mel Gibson had exposed entertainment icon Oprah Winfrey regarding ""Sound of Freedom,"" a film centered on child-sex trafficking. The title read, ""Mel Gibson Exposes Oprah's QUESTIONABLE Action For Hollywood Elite.""However, no part of the video, including its AI-generated narrator voice, ever presented evidence that Gibson had exposed Winfrey for anything. It was nothing more than misleading clickbait that was apparently meant to rake in YouTube advertising revenue based on obtaining video views from users who might be prone to placing blind trust in content as long as it agrees with their preexisting, evidence-free viewpoints.In this story, we've detailed multiple key points about the video, including its massive view count and the primary claims that were being made about Gibson and Winfrey.By early August, the original video link on the Just In YouTube channel had either been deleted or switched to private. We previously reached out to the channel to ask about its content, but did not receive a response.Before the original video became unavailable, multiple YouTube users reposted the full clip in their own reaction videos. In seemingly all of these reaction videos, the users who were reacting repeatedly made shocked and disgusted facial expressions and indicated with words to their viewers that, after watching the clip, they had concerns about Winfrey. Most of the people who posted reaction videos did not appear to spend even a few seconds to search the internet for information that would reveal the inaccuracies that the original video had misleadingly presented as facts.One reaction video that was posted by a prominent YouTube user was viewed nearly 3 million times. Other reaction videos had view counts that stretched as high as the tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands.When combining the likely view count of the original video with the views of all of the reaction videos (and TikTok reposts), it's entirely possible that the total view count for the clip extended into the tens of millions.The video began with remarks from past clips that featured Gibson and Winfrey, as well as the fake, AI-generated narrator voice:MEL GIBSON: [The] first time I really came over here. You know, I had a whole bunch of weird, paranoid suspicions, about what the hell was going on because there was a lot of stuff I couldn't understand.OPRAH WINFREY: You're seven years old and someone is stroking your penis. It feels good.GIBSON: Our future is our children. Now, the first step in eradicating this crime is awareness.NARRATOR: The latest buzz in Tinseltown is all about Mel Gibson's explosive revelations in the film, ""Sound of Freedom."" Brace yourselves as Mel pulls back the curtain on the dark underbelly of Hollywood's elite, exposing their alleged involvement in the scandalous world of illicit human trade. And guess who's caught right in the middle of it? None other than the iconic Oprah Winfrey herself. So, what exactly did Mel say?GIBSON: Our future is our children. Now, the first step in eradicating this crime is awareness.We've broken down several of these introductory parts of the video below.Gibson's comments at the beginning of the video came from an interview that was conducted back in 1998.We previously published a comprehensive report that laid out how the contents of that interview had been misleadingly edited and then reposted around the release date of ""Sound of Freedom"" in July 2023.As for Winfrey's comment about the seven-year-old, that clip was taken out of context from the 2019 special, ""Oprah Winfrey Presents: After Neverland.""In the special, Winfrey interviewed Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two subjects of the two-part HBO documentary ""Leaving Neverland,"" who both said they were sexually abused by the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. Prior to Jackson's death, he had denied that such allegations were true.In other words, Winfrey's remarks were part of an interview in which she was trying to openly talk about and somewhat expose the way that child-sex abusers commit their crimes.Here are Winfrey's full remarks from the full context of the interview:OPRAH WINFREY: So this is what so many people don't understand. A big part of the confusion and shame for child victims is that the attention and the seduction from the predator who is probably gonna be somebody you know. In order for it to work, it has to be somebody you know, somebody you admire, somebody you respect, or maybe even love. And, it feels good. I mean, if you're seven years old, and somebody, which I was trying to say this to my friend, to their children, if you're seven years old and someone is stroking your penis, it feels good. Even though you don't have a name for what that is, it feels good.WADE ROBSON: And that was such a particularly challenging part for me in beginning therapy. That was one of the biggest things I kept bringing to therapy was, ""What does it mean that it felt good? What does that mean about me?""WINFREY: Well that's one of the reasons it's so confusing for children. And when I first said this years ago, people were like, ""You're crazy,"" because everybody wants to believe it's like sexual assault and you're being thrown up against the wall and you're being raped. And I have said for years, if the abuser is any good, you won't even know it's happened. You will be in it and you won't even know it's happened. And if the abuser is any good, he or she is going to make you feel like you're part of it.This portion of the interview begins at the 32:36 mark in the YouTube video below:In May 2020, Reuters also reported about a rumor that was being shared in relation to the interview, writing, in part, ""Social media users have been sharing a video clip of Oprah Winfrey taken out of context and incorrectly headlined to allege she is condoning the sexual abuse of children. This is misleading and false.""The original video published by the Just In YouTube channel falsely claimed that Gibson portrayed the ""lead role"" of Tim Ballard in ""Sound of Freedom."" However, that character was played by Jim Caviezel.Gibson was not credited with directing, producing, writing, or apparently having anything to do with ""Sound of Freedom,"" which was released on July 4, 2023. According to IMDb.com, the film was directed by Alejandro Monteverde, written by Rod Barr and Monteverde, and had multiple producers, none of which was Gibson.Gibson did, however, help to promote the film by recording a short video. It was from that promotional video that the Just In YouTube channel pulled the remark, ""Our future is our children. Now, the first step in eradicating this crime is awareness.""NEW: Mel Gibson is promoting 'Sound of Freedom' which is set to be released tomorrow July 4th, exposing the reality of child sex trafficking.""The most disturbing problems in our world today is human trafficking, and particularly the trafficking of children. Now, the first step… pic.twitter.com/Uf61Vk2Hew— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) July 3, 2023""So, what exactly did Mel say?,"" the narrator in the Just In YouTube channel's viral video asked.The answer to the narrator's question: Nothing.Again, as previously mentioned, we found no record of Gibson having made any remarks about Winfrey on the subject, nor was there any evidence to support the long-running conspiracy theory that claimed she was involved in human-sex trafficking."	false
6104	Former U.S. president Barack Obama has announced a bid to become Secretary General of the United Nations.	"On 22 February 2018, the Your News Wire web site published an article reporting that former U.S. president Barack Obama had announced plans to become Secretary-General of the United Nations:
Barack Obama has announced plans to become secretary general of the United Nations, allowing him to advance his globalist agenda on the world’s stage. According to Al-Jarida, Obama has no intention to step away from the spotlight, much to the dismay of other world leaders such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s term expires in early 2017, making Obama’s bid for the position a possibility.
This story was false.  President Obama has announced no plans to seek the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations.The only source cited by Your News Wire for their article was a years-old, October 2016 report from a Kuwaiti newspaper that was described as ""far-fetched"" and unconfirmed at the time it was published:
Kuwaiti newspaper A Jarida reported that US President Barack Obama seeks to be appointed UN secretary general after his second term as US president ends. The newspaper claimed that Obama has been discussing the idea with senior Democrats and Republicans, some of whom are Jewish.The report, which admittedly appears somewhat far-fetched, has not been confirmed by any other news outlets and does not name any of its sources.
Moreover, the position of U.N. Secretary-General is not exactly one that can be gained through campaigning for it, nor is President Obama a likely choice for it.  First off, the Secretary General has to be nominated by the U.N. Security Council, and any one of that council's permanent members (China, France, Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States) could veto that selection — meaning that the Trump administration (and/or the Russian government) could unilaterally block any attempt by President Obama to become U.N. Secretary-General.  Additionally, the Secretary-General has to be appointed by the General Assembly (which comprises all 193 member states), many of whom would likely reject the thought of an American's leading that global organization. Finally, President Obama would be an unlikely choice for the role of U.N. chief administrative officer because, as Wikipedia notes, ""most Secretaries-General are compromise candidates from middle powers and have little prior fame"" (but Barack Obama hails from a major power and has achieved international fame).  The U.N. has never selected a Secretary-General from North America, and only once in United Nations history has a candidate from anywhere in the Americas been appointed to that position (Peruvian diplomat Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, who served from 1982 to 1991).Most crucially, Your News Wire's statement that ""U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s term expires in early 2017, making Obama’s bid for the position a possibility"" is woefully outdated. (This is not surprising, given that Your News Wire essentially ripped off a January 2016 Townhall article for their own report.)  Former Portuguese prime minister António Guterres took over as U.N. Secretary-General on 1 January 2017, and given that appointees traditionally hold that position for two five-year terms, President Obama would likely be facing a nine-year wait even if he were interested in making a bid for the U.N. spot."	false
1179	In June 2022, Elon Musk tweeted that he was leaning toward supporting Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis over former U.S. President Donald Trump in a future U.S. presidential election.	"On Nov. 17, 2022, Florida attorney Daniel Uhlfelder tweeted, ""We were warned. Elon Musk is DeSantis supporter."" Uhlfelder is a former candidate for Florida attorney general in the 2022 Democratic primary. The first part that said ""we were warned"" apparently referenced Uhlfelder's opinion of how Musk's recent takeover of Twitter was progressing.It's true that Musk once expressed support for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who is seen as a potential 2024 presidential candidate. He also tweeted that he would support DeSantis over former U.S. President Donald Trump.On June 15, 2022, Musk had tweeted that he voted in the Texas primary for Mayra Flores. The Republican candidate later lost her bid to win a seat in the U.S. House in Texas' 34th Congressional District.Musk also predicted a ""massive red wave."" However, that wave never came. While the GOP did take back the U.S. House with a very small majority, Democrats held onto the all-important U.S. Senate.In the same Twitter thread, Musk was asked if he was considering a Republican candidate for president in the future. ""TBD,"" answered Musk.The same user replied, ""What are you leaning towards?""""DeSantis,"" Musk answered.A different user asked Musk what he thought of Democrat Andrew Yang. Musk answered, ""I supported Yang last time, but DeSantis has a better chance of winning.""On July 11, Musk once again mentioned DeSantis' name, tweeting, ""Trump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America. If DeSantis runs against Biden in 2024, then DeSantis will easily win – he doesn't even need to campaign."""	true
328	An old Christmas picture of Michelle Obama with cropped hair and masculine features standing with her future husband, Barack Obama, is an authentic photograph of the future first lady.	"On Oct. 5, 2022, a Facebook user with thousands of followers posted an old and doctored picture of former U.S. President Barack Obama and his future wife, Michelle, in their younger days, standing next to a Christmas tree.The altered photograph pushed the false online conspiracy theory that the former first lady was born as a male and given the name ""Michael."" In reality, she was born female and named Michelle LaVaughn Robinson. These changes to Michelle Obama's face were likely made with Adobe Photoshop.The picture was posted on the Facebook account of Wanda Freeman Barzizza, the wife of a formal mayoral candidate for the city of Germantown, Tennessee. We previously reported several times about the fact that Barzizza has spent years sharing misleading information. The account had also received multiple month-long suspensions in the past, based on both the long gaps in time between posts and admissions made on her own public feed.The original, undoctored picture of the Obamas was apparently captured on Christmas Day in 1991, at least according to a Reddit post and the fact that a ring is not visible on future Mrs. Obama's hand. We found this information through the use of TinEye, a helpful reverse image search website."	false

5667	A video shows the aftermath of a school prank in which a student spiked lemonade with laxatives.	"A video purportedly showing the aftermath of a school prank in which a student spiked a batch of lemonade with laxatives was uploaded to the web site LiveLeak (removed) in mid-September 2018. This footage racked up millions of views when it was shared on Facebook along with the caption: ""So Wrong: A student puts laxative in the school's lemonade.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi50BOT5mkA
 This video does not capture real students at a high school suffering bouts of diarrhea after a student spiked their lemonade with laxatives. This footage was taken from the Netflix mockumentary television series American Vandal and depicts a staged incident involving a group of actors.American Vandal plays like a true crime documentary, but instead of focusing on villainous acts such as murder, the mockumentary takes place in a high school and features juvenile pranks and acts of vandalism. The second season of the show, which made its debut just a few days before this video went viral, opened with an episode entitled ""Brown Out."" The New Yorker described the opening sequence of that episode thusly:I got a queasy feeling watching the opening sequence of the new season of “American Vandal,” and not only because it showed a lunchroom full of teenagers soiling themselves. The scene is certainly disgusting: in an event known afterward as “the Brownout,” students at the fictional St. Bernardine prep school in tony Bellevue, Washington, having been poisoned by laxative-tainted lemonade, suffer together in a grisly act of mass defecation, all of it memorialized in real time and shared on social media."	false
5106	Video and photographs show a 5-foot-long jellyfish.	"Whenever we're asked to examine a photograph or video of an animal that has been going viral on the internet, we often find some aspect of the creature has been exaggerated. Perhaps the animal appears larger than it is due to the use of forced perspective. Perhaps the picture has been digitally altered. Or perhaps the animal isn't an animal at all but a movie prop. So when we started receiving queries about a ""Giant jellyfish the size of a human,"" we had a hunch some aspect of the footage would be amiss:Woah!!!!! We went diving in Falmouth yesterday to finish off #WildOceanWeek and came across this GIANT barrel jellyfish! ? What a way to finish off this marine wildlife adventure! ? pic.twitter.com/NNwDelfWyV— Lizzie Daly (@LizzieRDaly) July 14, 2019Turns out this is a genuine photograph of a very large barrel jellyfish (Rhizostoma pulmo). This picture was posted by Lizzie Daly, a wildlife biologist, who was filming a series of underwater adventures for the ""Wild Ocean Week"" fundraising project. The above-displayed photograph was snapped by her diving partner, Dan Abbott, off the coast of England near the town of Falmouth in July 2019.Abbott posted several other photographs of this jellyfish to his Instagram page:  The jellyfish that travelled around the world. It's been hard to put into words what the last few days has felt like, but ultimately I am so excited and proud that we got the world talking about the marine life in the UK.

I've never seen a jellyfish that big. It was the size of my body. That was the best thing I've ever done.""Daly elaborated on the encounter in an article published by the Guardian:""I've never seen one that big,"" said Lizzie Daly, a biologist who saw the creature near Falmouth. ""We had seen a few smaller jellyfish at a beautiful reef nearby, and then out of the murk came this huge, beautiful jelly fish. You just take a double look and ask yourself if it's actually a metre and a half long.""[...]The pair said they were not surprised by the animal's behaviour. ""It has got a very mild sting and poses no threat to humans – some people don't even feel it,"" Daly said. ""Many people would be immediately worried, but it is not dangerous. Its a majestic creature.""Daly estimated that the jellyfish was about 1.5 meters in length (about 5 feet). While this is certainly a large barrel jellyfish, it's not even close in size to the largest jellyfish in the ocean, the lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata), or ""Giant jellyfish,"" whose total body length can exceed 120 feet long. To learn more about Daly's project, or Wild Ocean Week, you can check out her page here:To celebrate our oceans Lizzie is embarking on an ambitious circumnavigation of the UK to document and share her encounters with some of the UK's most charismatic marine species!

483	In April 2023, a video authentically showed a newt rapidly changing its skin color.	"On April 26, 2023, accounts on Twitter and Facebook shared a viral video supposedly showing a newt or an axolotl, a type of salamander found in Mexico, rapidly changing its color. Another Twitter user asked: ""These are Newts no? Anyone know how they change colors like this?"" Rather than newts, the video showed what appeared to be two axolotls in a dish with water. The most striking feature of the video is that only one of the creatures changed its color. The black one remained the same color throughout. Some users on both social media platforms commented that the video, which had garnered over 2 million views, appeared fake and computer-generated.The video was indeed digitally created. That particular clip was originally posted to Twitter by Research From Human, which described itself as a parody account, and its timeline contained a number of fake videos. Snopes reached out to the tweeter who originally had posted the clip to ask about the source of the video, but we have not heard back yet. We will update the report when – and if – we get a response. A similar video with the description ""Changing color salamander. Viral!!"" – but with different audio – appeared on YouTube in 2019.An analysis of the Research From Human video showed it to be computer-generated. First, all research on newts, salamanders and axolotls show they have some spots on the skin. In the video, the two creatures appeared to have sleek and spotless skin. Moreover, axolotls are known to have quite noticeable gills near their head. Neither of the two creatures in the video had them. Additionally, at about the seven-second mark in the video, the legs on the lower part of the creature that changed its color go missing."	false
1352	"Chocolate milk is made from ""regular"" milk rejected for containing too much cow's blood."	"The belief that yucky things lurk in the depths of dark-colored liquids is a widespread food fear. Blood is generally considered icky, so schoolchildren regularly horrify each other with whispered claims that the milk used in chocolate milk is just swimming with the stuff. Now that prepared coffee beverages are making it to the supermarket shelves we're seeing this particular tale expand to include those products, thereby broadening the age range of this rumor's audience.(The belief that cow's blood is to be scrupulously avoided at all costs is suspended in our dealings with meat products. No one recoils in horror at the thought that a steak or a hamburger contains cow's blood — our beef with ingesting blood apparently stops at the fork.)In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration oversees the safety of food products. Stringent standards have been established for all milk destined for consumers, including the chocolate variety. It is telling that this agency's specifications contain no allowances for the use of blood-contaminated milk. Milk products (and other foodstuffs) that do not meet the agency's criteria do not gain FDA approval and thus cannot be sold to consumers.In other words, the ""cow's blood in the chocolate milk"" story doesn't fly any better than a cow would.A similar version of this rumor which claimed to show ""what cow's milk looks like before they whiten it"" was circulated on social media in 2017: Although this image is genuine, it doesn't show the ""real color of cow's milk"" before it gets whitened. This image was taken from a 2013 video from the ""Funky Farmer"", and it shows the milk produced by a cow that had recently given birth.In fact, farmer Richard Cornock explicitly states in the following video that the red color doesn't happen very often, and that the pictured milk is ""not fit for human consumption"":""In this case on the left we have a lot of blood in the milk. It doesn't happen often like that but occasionally you get blood in the milk because maybe there's a blood vessel burst in the udder or something. That always comes right in the end. Might take a week of milking. But as you can see it's not fit for human consumption. So we have to keep that out at the end."" <!--Last updated:   24 January 20075 March 2001 - original 24 January 2007 - reformatted   Sources: "	false
1102	Paul McCartney endorsed CBD gummies.	"In December 2022, we received reader mail that asked if singer-songwriter Paul McCartney had endorsed CBD gummies. This rumor was false. We found no information that credibly linked McCartney to any CBD gummies products.We found various websites online that falsely claimed McCartney endorsed Sweet Relief CBD Gummies, Pure Calms High Grade CBD Gummies, PureKana CBD Gummies, Hillstone CBD Gummies, Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies, Pure CBD Gummies, Unabis CBD Gummies, and others.This whole ruse had a scammy feel to it, but we opted for a ""False"" rating instead of ""Scam"" to establish the fact that McCartney's image and likeness were being used without permission, and to drive home the fact that he had nothing to do with any of this.A search of Facebook led us to details about how this rumor started.Paid ads on Facebook and perhaps even Instagram advertised a link with a picture of McCartney. The link in the ads showed a headline that felt a bit like a death hoax, even though the former member of The Beatles and Wings was not dead. It read, ""A Tragic End Today for Paul McCartney."" This was an attempt to bait readers into clicking on the ads.One Facebook user posted that the misleading ads were also going around with the headline, ""Paul McCartney's SNL Impression.""Any users who clicked the links in the Facebook ads were led to a scammy page on esigocaf.top or another website. The website loaded what may have appeared to be a credible article that claimed McCartney had endorsed CBD gummies. However, this article was designed by scammers. The logos and layouts for Time.com, People.com and other big-name news organizations were duplicated to fool readers into believing they were on those publishers' real websites.Any attempts to refresh the article or copy the link and visit the page later would result in a different page being loaded that would show a fake online shop for items not related to CBD gummies. Basically, unless a user clicked directly from the Facebook ads, scammers were attempting to hide the scammy CBD endorsement article from prying eyes using something known as an inline frame (iframe) in the code of the page. We've seen this before with other celebrities such as film and TV actor Tom Selleck.The fake article we reviewed showed ""Time"" in the browser tab, apparently for Time magazine, yet the website was designed to look like People.com. Again, this website was hosted on esigocaf.top, not People.com.The headline for the completely made-up story read, ""Big Pharma In Outrage Over Paul McCartney's Latest Business Venture - He Fires Back With This!""(People) - In an insightful 1-on-1 interview, one of the world's most popular stars reveals how he ""wouldn't be here without CBD.""Musician who gained worldwide fame with the Beatles, English singer and gifted business genius, Paul McCartney made headlines after revealing his new CBD line on Live TV last week. Pharmaceutical companies were outraged saying they will be filing a lawsuit against Paul McCartney and his partners for violating their contract and undercutting their prices. Paul McCartney responded with this:""When I started this whole thing back in 2015, it really was just a part time passion project and a way for me to give back. After being given so much, I figured there was no better time to make CBD Gummies available to everyone, as it can help thousands of people experience life pain-special and live much happier lives.""...Bayer and Purdue Pharma were furious after seeing a massive dip in their sales, calling for Paul McCartney to be indicted, saying: ""We're happy Paul McCartney found something to replace prescriptions, but his announcement was a direct breach of contract. His network should fire him immediately and he should formally apologize.""The story went on to falsely claim that McCartney was giving out ""special samples,"" and that other celebrities, including Drew Carey, Tom Hanks, Randy Jackson, and Halle Berry, had all given their stamp of approval to the musician's supposed CBD gummies line. None of this was true. All of these celebrities were having their image and likeness used completely without any authorization. Further, Time magazine and People magazine had nothing to do with any of this.In addition to the social media ads and the fake article, we found tons of scammy Facebook pages with names including McCartney's name and the words ""CBD gummies."" Most of these pages had between 0 and 2 followers.We found one clue as to where the McCartney CBD gummies scam may have been originating from on TribuneIndia.com.A sponsored content article was purchased on the India-based news website by an unknown person or company and showed the headline, ""Paul McCartney CBD Gummies [SCAM OR LEGIT] Shocking Side Effects REVIEWS?"" We've seen this before with other websites also based in India, which might indicate that the fake celebrity endorsements were created by people residing in the country.The article claimed to advertise a product that does not exist called, ""Paul McCartney CBD Gummies."" Links within the sponsored article led to online stores that claimed to sell CBD gummies, but made no mention of McCartney."	false
2391	3D-printed Sarco capsules for assisted suicides, which can be activated from the inside by the person intending to die, have been approved under Swiss law.	"Dr. Philip Nitschke, the man behind the Sarco capsule, claims that the pods have passed a “legal review” and will be available for use in Switzerland in 2022. But details of the “legal review” have not been revealed. Experts consulted by Sarco have argued use of the pod falls outside of Swiss law. A number of assisted suicide organizations in Switzerland have also expressed skepticism over using the machine, and the legality surrounding it. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health, suicide or substance use crisis or emotional distress, reach out 24/7 to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) by dialing or texting 988 or using chat services at suicidepreventionlifeline.org to connect to a trained crisis counselor. A 3D-printed capsule, designed to help people carry out their suicide, is reportedly going to be made available in Switzerland in 2022. That’s according to Dr. Philip Nitschke, the man who designed the Sarco capsule in conjunction with Exit International, his voluntary assisted dying organization with branches in Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and U.K. In an interview published on news outlet Swissinfo, which is part of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, Nitschke described how the capsule would work:It’s a 3-D printed capsule, activated from the inside by the person intending to die. The machine can be towed anywhere for the death. It can be in an idyllic outdoor setting or in the premises of an assisted suicide organisation, for example.The person will get into the capsule and lie down.  It’s very comfortable. They will be asked a number of questions and when they have answered, they may press the button inside the capsule activating the mechanism in their own time. The capsule is sitting on a piece of equipment that will flood the interior with nitrogen, rapidly reducing the oxygen level to 1 per cent from 21 per cent in about 30 seconds. The person will feel a little disoriented and may feel slightly euphoric before they lose consciousness. Death takes place through hypoxia and hypocapnia, oxygen and carbon dioxide deprivation, respectively. There is no panic, no choking feeling.He also claimed that the capsule had passed “legal review” and there ""are no legal issues at all” to this capsule being available in the market by 2022. His stated goal was to “de-medicalise” the dying process.However, Nitschke did not release details of this “legal review,” nor did he initially discuss which experts carried it out. We reached out to Exit International, and will update this article if we get more information.A number of headlines by legitimate news organizations made it seem as if such pods are now legal in Switzerland. An Insider headline on Dec. 6, 2021, stated, “3D-printed suicide pods are now legal in Switzerland.” A Daily Beast headline on the same day said, ""Switzerland approves ‘assisted suicide’ capsule."" This, however, is presently not the case. What are the current rules surrounding assisted suicide in the country? The practice is legal if it is offered without selfish motive to another person, and if that person is capable of making decisions. Non-physician-assisted suicide is permitted, and the role of doctors is limited to prescribing the lethal drug and assessing the person’s decision-making capacity. Doctors do not perform the assisted suicide themselves, but Nitschke’s goal is to remove them from the process entirely through this capsule. Nitschke also described how they would use “an artificial intelligence screening system” to assess the patient’s mental capacities, and after an online test, they would receive a code to access Sarco. A Dec. 8 investigation by watson.ch, another Swiss news organization, found that there was no evidence of the Swiss government actually approving the use of these machines. The organization spoke to Nitschke by phone, and he said he did not want to provide the legal opinion.Nitschke also claimed to be speaking to various groups in Switzerland to launch the capsule. We spoke to some Swiss nonprofit organizations that aid in assisted suicides. They expressed skepticism about whether such machines would even be used under the current rules. EXIT, unaffiliated with Exit International, and one of the largest established nonprofits that provide end-of-life care in the country, told us it never had any contact with Nitschke on this matter.“For us, many questions remain unanswered about this method for physician assisted suicide. Among other things, it is unclear what the exact content of the legal opinion for legalization is and from whom it originates,” Jürg Wiler, vice president of the organization said. “EXIT does not see 'Sarco' as an alternative to the physician-assisted suicides that EXIT carries out in Switzerland,” he added.We also spoke to Dignitas, another nonprofit organization, that said Swissinfo had let itself be used for some “PR campaign.” Dignitas said:The fact is: for 35 years now, through the two Swiss Exit groups (not related to “Exit International”) – and for 23 years also with “Dignitas – To live with dignity – To die with dignity” – Switzerland has the practice of professional accompanied suicide with trained staff of these non-profit organisations, in cooperation with physicians/doctors, using the many decades known medication Sodium Pentobarbital [...] and each case of such accompanied suicide is reported to the authorities for investigation by state prosecutor, police and forensics. This practice is approved, and supported by the vast majority of the public and politics.Therefore, in the light of this established, safe and professionally conducted/supported practice, we would not imagine that a technologized capsule for a self-determined end of life will meet much acceptance and/or interest in Switzerland.Soon after the inaccurate headlines spread, Swissinfo issued a correction to its report, saying it was “deeply sorry for this misleading title and information.” The group added that the organization Nitschke was referring to in the original story was Pegasos, a voluntary assisted dying association established in 2019. The headline has also been amended to: ""Sarco suicide capsule hopes to enter Switzerland.""SwissMedic, the medical association responsible for regulating medical products, told The Associated Press that it never approved Sarco. Nitschke told the AP that he never pursued approval, and obtained an outside legal opinion from a former chair of Infrastructure Law and New Technologies at Germany’s Freiberg University of Mining and Technology. He argued that the source determined that the capsule did not need formal authorization or licensing. Any decision about the product, Nitschke said, could only be made if someone brought the issue to court after it had been used. According to the BBC, Daniel Huerlimann, an assistant professor at the University of St. Gallen, was asked by Sarco to offer a legal opinion. He concluded that the machine would not be covered by the Swiss Therapeutic Products Act, as it did not constitute a medical device. He argued that it ultimately would be outside of Swiss law.Kerstin Noelle Vkinger, a professor at the University of Zurich, disagreed, and told Swiss newspaper Neue Zurcher Zeitung that the issue was more complicated than that.“Medical devices are regulated because they are supposed to be safer than other products. Just because a product is not beneficial to health does not mean that it is not also affected by these additional safety requirements,” she said. Snopes has previously covered these ""death pods"" when we debunked a satirical claim that they were legalized in Hawaii. Ultimately, use of the pod has not been officially legalized in Switzerland, and whether it will be available for use under current Swiss laws is up for debate. As such we rate this claim as “False.” Sources:Andorno, Roberto. “Nonphysician-Assisted Suicide in Switzerland.” Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics, vol. 22, no. 3, 2013, pp. 246–253., doi:10.1017/S0963180113000054.

4290	The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club was headed to Seattle in June 2020 to fight antifa.	"In June 2020, a rumor started circulating on social media that the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club was heading to Seattle, Washington, to fight antifa, or anti-fascists, in the city's Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), a so-called ""cop free"" area that was set up amid widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice:  But no evidence has been provided to support this claim. The media included in the above-displayed tweets is a few years old, and Sonny Barger, the founder of the Hell's Angels, has issued a statement refuting this rumor. The top image was taken in 2018 as members of the Hells Angels rode to a national gathering in Quebec, Canada. The brief clip included in the second image comes from a 2011 music video by Lady Gaga:Similar videos purporting to show the Hells Angels ""on their way"" to Seattle to fight anti-fascist protesters can also be traced back to old and unrelated events. One video posted to YouTube in June 2020, for example, claimed that it showed ""Hell’s Angels and Mongols riding together on their way to Seattle to scrap with Antifa Terrorists,"" but actually used footage from 2010. Sonny Barger, the founder of the Hells Angels, dismissed these rumors in a Facebook post on June 13, 2020, in which he wrote:""People have asked me about these fake articles involving the Hells Angels and another club going to face antifa. Stop, It's untrue and will never happen.""Motorcycle clubs are frequently used in online hoaxes attempting to show how right-leaning causes have the support of ""tough"" individuals. While there truly is a ""Bikers for Trump"" group that has showed support for the president at various rallies and events, the support and influence of these motorcycle groups has been wildly exaggerated in social media posts."	false
629	George Floyd made an offensive comment about trans people on Twitter in 2011.	"We have encountered a number of incorrect and misleading rumors over the years about George Floyd, a Black man killed in a police encounter in 2020. The latest one involves an offensive statement he allegedly made on Twitter regarding trans people. According to a screenshot making the rounds attributed to a Twitter account that claims to be Floyd's (@BigFloyd73), he allegedly tweeted in 2011: ""These trans folk straight up fuked in they head [sic]."" The screenshot does not show a tweet from an account that was ever owned by George Floyd. The account's bio indicates it was created in July 2022. The real Floyd died on May 25, 2020, in Minneapolis after a police officer knelt on his neck for about nine minutes as he struggled to breathe. It's impossible for the tweet to be correctly attributed to Floyd, since he died years before the impersonator account on which it appeared even existed.That same account appeared to acknowledge being the original source of the screenshot in another tweet, saying ""yeah I said dis and? [sic]""Oftentimes, rumors surrounding victims of police brutality go viral, particularly because they seek to discredit the victims, or in this particular case, pit vulnerable groups against one another. We put together a guide on racial propaganda here. "	false
1531	On Oct. 4, 2021, William Ribeiro, a former player for Sport Club Sao Paulo, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after kicking a referee in the head during a match.	"In early October 2021, Snopes became aware of numerous reports claiming that Brazilian police had arrested a football (i.e., soccer) player on suspicion of attempted murder after he had supposedly kicked a referee in the head.The claim was accurate. Law enforcement officers arrested William Ribeiro, a player with Sport Club Sao Paulo, after he attacked a referee who had awarded a foul against him during an away game against Guarani-RS in Venâncio Aires on Oct. 4, according to multiple reputable news outlets including Reuters. That news outlet reported:The game was halted 14 minutes into the second half while referee Rodrigo Crivellaro was taken to hospital. He was later released.""I decided... to charge the lad with attempted murder because in my perception of the case he took the risk of (inflicting) a lethal outcome,"" the officer in charge of the case told Brazilian portal UOL.Citing an interview with Vinicius de Lourenco de Assuncao, who is the police chief of Venâncio Aires and arrested Ribeiro during the game, a CNN story said the football official, Crivellaro, was kicked in the head and first responders took him from the stadium to the hospital unconscious.""I don't really remember (what happened). My refereeing colleagues told me that I gave him a yellow card. He punched me in the face, I fell to the ground, got kicked, and passed out,"" Crivellaro told a local radio station, as reported by CNN.Snopes reached out to police officials to learn if Ribeiro had ever been arrested before Oct. 4, and, if so, under what circumstances. A spokesperson for the state of Rio Grande do Sul's police department declined to answer saying, the agency ""does not disclose third party information,"" according to a Google translation.Hours after the incident, the head of Sport Club Sao Paulo, Deivid Goulart Pereira, released the below-displayed apology statement obtained by Snopes. In the message, Pereira said Ribeiro's alleged actions at the Oct. 4 game — which was initially supposed to be a celebration of the organization's 113-year anniversary — was ""one of the saddest episodes"" since the club's start, according to a Portuguese-to-English Google translation.""[It was] a fateful scene that shocked all those who live the sport in general,"" the statement read. ""We apologize to the abused professional and his family,"" as well as the public.Additionally, Pereira's statement said the club terminated Ribeiro's contract, and that it would take legal action to ensure justice for the referee, according to the translation.The Oct. 4 match restarted on Oct. 5, with Guarani winning 1-0, according to Reuters, which cited state football federation records.Sport Club Sao Paulo is a small organization from Rio Grande, a city of about 200,000 people, that plays in the second division of the Rio Grande do Sul state championship, Reuters reported. We reached out to the club to learn more about the incident involving Ribeiro, and we so far have not received a response.Footage of the attack spread widely on social media. On Oct. 5, around 6:30 p.m. (EST), the Brazilian news network Band Jornalismo tweeted about Riberio's arrest and shared a video recording of what happened on the field.Then, the next morning, that same news outlet, Band Jornalismo, reported that hospital staff had released Crivellaro and that Ribeiro had posted bail, according to a Google translation of the below-displayed tweet.State authorities' investigation into Riberio's actions remains ongoing, as of this writing, and the athlete has yet to comment publicly, according to CNN."	true
554	Actor William Shatner died in March 2023.	"In March 2023, rumors circulated online claiming that ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner had died in a car accident. These rumors, like previous instances in which Shatner was reported dead on social media, were false. A YouTube video titled ""Tragic End for a Legendary Actor: Remembering William Shatner | William Shatner died Car Accident"" was posted in mid-March. The ""news"" of Shatner's death was conveyed in nonsensical, ungrammatical captions over a montage of photos of the actor. For example, one caption read: ""The 92-year-old actor William Shatner was driving a car alone when he collided with another elderly woman's car. It is not clear who was killed in the collision, but at the scene, both cars were severely damaged."" The video (below) did not cite any sources for these claims.A Twitter account using the name ""who died today"" (which was also the name of the YouTube channel) tweeted a link to the video on March 22, along with a fake screenshot of CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" program on which the chyron read, ""Actor William Shatner 'Star Trek' Died Today??"" (@Hoale77979013/Twitter)In fact, the 92-year old from Canada, who acted in ""Star Trek"" movie franchise, was very much alive, and remained so at the time of this writing. He seemed to be in a jovial mood on April 21, 2023, when he tweeted, ""I am writing right side up for down under. It's that you've trained your mind to read upside down text.""This was not the first time (and won't likely be the last) that a Shatner death hoax surfaced online. In 2018, the actor called out Facebook on his Twitter account about the false rumor then going around. ""Hey @facebook isn't this your messenger app? What's up with you allowing this Acocet Retail Sales ad to pass your muster? Thought you were doing something about this?""Aware of these death hoaxes, Shatner has often had to debunk the claim, sometimes taking satirical aim at trolls. ""No, I am dead,"" he tweeted in reply to the question, ""Will you ever appear in any of the news shows like DISCOVERY or PICARD?"" in 2020."	false
54	Oscar-winning actor George Clooney revealed that he is part of the LGBTQ+ community, as claimed in an online advertisement for Reference.com.	"In early August 2023, an advertisement was displayed to online users that claimed Oscar-winning actor George Clooney had come ""out of the closet,"" apparently implying that he had recently revealed he is gay. The ad read, ""Clooney, 64, Out of the Closet. At 64, George Clooney confirms the speculation.""This ad led to an extremely lengthy list article on reference.com that showed the headline, ""Stars You May Not Know Are LGBTQ+.""The article began as follows:The entertainment industry has long been a space where members of the LGBTQ+ community have thrived, despite the societal pressures that have often kept them in the shadows. From the early days of Hollywood to the present day, there have been countless stars who identify as LGBTQ+, but many have kept their identities hidden for fear of retribution or damage to their careers. However, with the rise of LGBTQ+ rights and representation in recent years, more and more stars are coming out and proudly sharing their identities with the world.However, nowhere in the massive article was Clooney's name even once mentioned. It was nothing but false and misleading clickbait.In September 2014, Clooney married Amal Alamuddin, who, following the wedding, assumed his last name.As of August 2023, we found no evidence that the couple had split or that Clooney had revealed he identified as part of the LGBTQ+ community.As for the misleading ad and article, in the website address (URL) of the story, the campaign name for the advertising campaign was visible. It read as, ""go_002_btq_7-31_x_us_george_clooney_zero_28091c."" In other words, the person or people who managed the ads were tracking various metrics, so that they could measure if it was successful in receiving clicks.The purpose of the ad and the idea of tracking its metrics were all about a strategy for making money. That strategy is called arbitrage.Here's how arbitrage works: Taking the false Clooney ad as an example, the advertiser who created the ad hoped to make money based upon people viewing and clicking on the other ads in the extremely lengthy reference.com article. If they made more money back on their own ads in the reference.com article when compared to the budget they put toward the false Clooney ad, then they profited."	false
1732	A Zimbabwean inventor named Sangulani Maxwell Chikumbutso invented an electric car that requires no charging.	"Since 2015, a Zimbabwean man named Sangulani Maxwell Chikumbutso has been hailed by some on the internet as iconoclastic genius and self-taught inventor who successfully created an electric car that runs perpetually without ever needing a charge.As outlandish and self-evidently incorrect as that assertion is, the journey to the source of that rumor is a fascinating mystery that began with an unsolicited invitation to a media event for a then-unknown company and provides insight into how the viral sausage is made.The Saith Technologies ""Open Day"" EventOn 20 July 2015, Zimbabwean tech news site Techzim began reporting on a company named Saith Technologies. The outlet said at the time that they had never heard of the company, but that they had been invited to an ""Open Day"" in which the company would display their new, locally produced inventions to the media:Has anyone ever heard of Saith Technologies? To be honest, I hadn’t until today. Tomorrow, [...] the company will hold an open day to showcase technologies that they have been working on at the Bluffhill Industrial Park in Harare.What caught our attention [...] is how Saith Technologies has promised to display a series of world-class technologies that usually capture the public’s attention (not just in Zimbabwe but worldwide).Included in their line-up is a locally produced drone (Yes, drone!), a locally produced electric car, road safety products, industrial technologies and what they term the “green power machine” which produces power using environmentally friendly technology.The event was evidently well publicized, and even garnered a television spot on South Africa’s SABC news channel. All photographic evidence used to support the existence of Chikumbutso’s inventions stem from an evidently choreographed event held over the course of one day in 2015, and the website for Saith Technologies is populated with photos only from that one day. The most important (and dubious) claim relates to what he has dubbed the ""Greener Power Machine,"" or GPM, described on Saith's site:Maxwell Sangulani has always claimed the he would try to advance the ability to produce electricity by utilizing radio frequency, and this has been a proven fact. By revealing undisclosed substance (industry secreted) to radio wavelengths, the Eco-friendly power generator has the capacity to funnel the power generated into functional electrical energy.Saith claims that the electric car requires no charging by utilizing a combination of regular batteries and a GPM to amplify them as its engine, breaking the laws of physics by producing more energy than is put into the device:[Chikumbutso] imported the shell and went through the process, with artisans, of manufacturing the chassis and mounting the “engine”. The same power generation in the Greener generator is the one that is deployed in their Electric Vehicle.The car does not require recharging from an electricity source. It requires just 5 regular gel batteries to start generating enough capacity to power the car and recharge the batteries (perpetual vehicle). Scientifically, perpetual motion says that once an object starts moving unless hindered by an external force, it will continue to move forever.The scientific premise behind the purported GPM is similar to actual physics-abiding technology known as radio frequency harvesting. The concept with these devices is that they they convert ambient radio waves, the result of humanity's love affair with technology, that bounce around our planet into enough energy to power extremely low energy devices like smoke detectors or fitness monitors. A 30 September 2015 story from the Telegraph about a company named Freevolt describes the basic idea:""It is the nature of broadcast transmissions that, when you broadcast, only some of the energy is received and used. The energy that is not received goes to waste. It's only nanowatts of energy, but the energy is everywhere,"" said [Paul Drayson, CEO of the company that owns the patent].""What we're doing is using that fact to power very small low-energy devices. The radio frequency transmissions come from wireless networks, and as our hunger for information goes up, the amount of data that we want to transmit is going up exponentially, and therefore this is growing all the time.""The central difference between radio frequency harvesting (which can at present barely power a Fitbit) and Chikumbutso's GPM is that the latter allegedly takes these radio frequencies and somehow amplifies them without extra power merely by exposing them to a ""trade secreted"" substance. Evidently, the gathered reporters were not given enough — or any — information to test these outlandish claims. ""We are not sure how this assertion can be dispelled and we hope at some forum scientist[s] will put the claims to test,"" TechZim said three days after the event.This ""open day"" event apparently served primarily as a way to produce promotional material for Saith Technology, including a sleek video about Chikumbutso and his inspiring and unlikely story of unique genius. Chikumbutso has repeatedly stated that he has been unable to patent his device since perpetual motion machines (which would violate the first and second laws of thermodynamics) are unpatentable. Techzim ceased reporting on Saith Technologies after filing their 24 July 2015 report, evidently unconvinced that the company had much to offer. Techzim editor Leonard Sengere told us that they never had access to Chikumbutso after that event:[Our reporter] did attend the event and they were taken on a tour of the 'inventions.' The electric car and the generator were shown running and that was the extent of it. There was no chance for anyone to verify exactly what they were running on.In any case, the scientific community largely just ignored him. Over here at Techzim, we are no scientists and even we just covered the event as a duty as we did not believe his claims. After the 'open day,' we never not get access to him and that was that. Life went on.The 2017 Revival of Maxwell ChikumbutsoOn 6 June 2017, the web site 263Chat (which apparently is a Zimbabwe-based media outlet), brought Maxwell Chikumbutso back into the news with the following headline: ""Trump Scoops Top Zimbabwean Inventor Maxwell Chikumbutso.""That story, with its odd headline focused on United States President Donald Trump (despite no mention of the president in the story), claimed that Chikumbutso had been given an opportunity to continue his work in California, since nobody in Africa's entrepreneurial communities had taken any interest:The United States government has given Zimbabwe’s prolific inventor Maxwell Chikumbutso a new home in its populous state of California. Chikumbutso is the founder of Saith Holdings Inc. under which he made headlines for his serial innovations which include the world’s first ever green power generator which can produce electricity using radio frequencies, an electric powered car which doesn’t consume fuel, a multi-fueled helicopter and many more.In an interview with Chikumbutso from his new base in the United States of America, he expressed disappointment that Africa did not see what the US Government saw in his ground breaking inventions.“The USA Government saw what Africa did not and California is now our HOME, the Head Office of Saith Holdings Inc. I always love AFRICA and I’m so proud of being born and raised in AFRICA. I will surely come back to Zimbabwe where everything started.”  said Chikumbutso.While we are unable to confirm any details of this story or discern what role (if any) the United States may have (or would have had) in encouraging Chikumbutso's alleged move, the story adds a number of claims to the mythology of this ""serial inventor"" — most notably the alleged source of funding for his work on electric cars and GPMs:In 2003, Maxwell began to get ideas on creating a self-powered generator. Through [patent lawyer Bruce Mujeyi], Maxwell interfaced with some prominent professors in Zimbabwe who told him that it was impossible to create such a machine.[...]An opportunity arose in South Africa where Johannesburg City Power invited tenders for new and renewable energy solutions. Among the bidders, Maxwell was the only individual. In spite of that, he performed exceptionally but unfortunately, he lost the opportunity because the awarding director wanted a portion of shares in the company in exchange for his grant. [... It was that time] that he met with Angolan born pastor and businessman Dr Teddy De Almeida in Johannesburg.Dr Almeida owns one of the biggest energy companies in Angola under the Bongani Group. He bought into Maxwell’s vision and contributed over $500,000 seed money desiring no return for his investment. No documents signed, just a stern warning to use the money wisely. Eventually when the Greener Machine was eventually completed[,] he invited Dr Almeida to take up equity in Saith Technologies.Teddy de Almeida is, according to a number of sites, the Angolan-born chief executive officer of an international collection of companies named Bongani Group, as well as a pastor and entrepreneur in South Africa. On the web site for ""Bongani Trading,"" a subsidiary of the Bongani Group for which he is described as CEO, his biography states:Dr. Teddy De Almeida is the current president of the South Africa-Angola Chamber of Commerce. Prior to forming Bongani, Dr. Teddy was the CEO and managing director of GVA South Africa. He was also a CEO of Consolidated Trading Services and a Managing Director of Transanglo Import and Export. He holds an MBA degree from MANCOSA, Doctor of Ministry from Covington Theological Seminary (USA). He sits on various boards of companies, he has travels [sic] extensively around the globe for workshops and speaking engagements. He has met various heads of states and attends numerous summits. Dr. Teddy is also a Pastor at Alleluia Ministries.We have reached out to de Almeida as well as executive chairman and alleged co-financier of Saith Technologies Luis Caupenela to ask if they did, indeed, provide any funding to Chikumbutso or Saith Technologies, but have not received a response from either individual. Cryptically, a 28 September 2016 Facebook post on an account owned by de Almeida makes only one passing reference to Saith Technology's alleged work in California:Today is a blessed day, in early November we will launch our Eletric [sic] car in California, the only Eletric [sic] car that doesn't need to be recharged.The Bongani Trading website that lists Caupenela and de Almeida as executives has not been updated since 2014, and includes several unfinished pages meant to be templates for news stories, suggesting that perhaps the site may not be as official as it appears, or, alternately, that their purported investment yielded no actual news.It is also worth noting that 263chat's website has a disclaimer making it clear that truth is not necessarily the goal of their work: ""we make no representations [...] of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability or availability with respect to the website or the information, products, services, or related graphics contained on the website for any purpose,"" the page reads.Regardless, the story originally published on 263Chat has been cloned repeatedly by countless other extremely dubious web sites, including the Zambian Observer — a site that has trafficked in fake news in the past and which may have no actual connection to the country of Zambia.All of these stories rely on the claims and photographs made during one July 2015 ""open day"" event. Despite being published two years later, these accounts offer no new evidence of Chikumbutso's claims and contain no new information that could be used to verify said claims.The 2018 Revival of Maxwell ChikumbutsoOn 25 April 2018, the conspiracy oriented, reality-adjacent website Collective Evolution picked up the story once again, this time citing the aforementioned Zambian Observer story and the 2015 video of that same event from South African television. As is often the case with Collective Evolution articles, the claims made there have been cloned and regurgitated ad infinitum by other dubious clickbait sites.Despite now being years removed from the only demonstration of this alleged technology, their article (like all the rest) presents no new information that provides any reason to take Chikumbutso's claims — which, again, violate the fundamental laws of physics — seriously. Instead, Collective Evolution argued that Chikumbutso may be at risk now that the United States government is ""involved,"" although how it is involved it does not say:Right now, he is residing in California. Why did they do this? Was it because they came across a revolutionary with the power to change the world, or is it because they want to keep that which threatens their entire geo-political framework close to home so they can keep an eye on it, and control it? Who knows. But it’s always important to question the intentions of our government.Was it always a scam, perhaps designed to elicit donations? It's possible, and the Saith Technologies website does have a donation section. Perhaps later web sites realized that this self-made genius story was clickbait gold and continued running with it for that reason.It's also entirely possible that investors, and perhaps even Chikumbutso himself, fully believed in the technology they attempted to demonstrate in June 2015 — but the fact that no more demonstrations have occurred makes it clear something was, or is, off. It strains credulity to think that a car that runs indefinitely without recharging or fuel would not receive widespread financial support. We have attempted to contact Saith Technologies, but have not yet received a response."	false
1210	The use of Sharpie pens is not allowed on ballots in the state of Illinois.	"On Nov. 8, 2022, as voters were headed to the polls for Election Day, the right-wing Awake Illinois Twitter account tweeted, ""La Grange Precinct 89 voters report sharpies being used on ballots, which isn't allowed. NO SHARPIES ON BALLOTS."" However, it's false that Sharpie pens are not allowed on ballots in the state of Illinois.The Illinois State Board of Elections (SBE) was quick to respond to the rumor, tweeting, ""Sharpies are an approved ballot marking device for many voting systems.""The Awake Illinois account replied, ""Is it correct to say sharpies are NOT the office ink of the election booth?"" In response, Illinois SBE said, ""Each voting system has a different preferred type of marking device for their ballots/tabulators. You would have to check with your jurisdiction to see what their manufacturer recommends.""Another user said of Sharpie pens, ""They bled through to the other side of the ballot!!!."" Once again, the Illinois SBE answered, ""The ballots are intentionally designed so that bleedthrough does not cause a problem. The target ovals on one side don't overlap on the other side.""On top of these responses, the Illinois SBE tweeted a special graphic about these facts:The image read as follows:IMPORTANT NOTICE: Sharpie pens are the preferred ballot marking method for many voting systems. There is no need to be concerned about the use of Sharpies in the polling place. They have been tested and approved to be used on these devices. In the event the ink bleeds through to the other side of the ballot, the ballots have been designed with timing tracks to offset the offices from front to back to prevent bleed from being an issue."	false
2159	"The ""aphelion phenomenon"" in 2022 will bring abnormally cold weather, more sickness, and another wave of COVID-19."	"""Aphelion"" describes the moment during Earth's orbit around the sun when the two celestial bodies are furthest apart. This happens every year around July (not in February, as claimed in a copypasta text), and there is nothing unique about the aphelion in 2022 that would bring abnormally cold weather, more sickness, or another wave of COVID-19. In February 2022, a piece of text was copied and pasted across Facebook claiming that the ""aphelion phenomenon"" would bring colder than normal weather and cause more sickness, including a new wave of COVID-19. While ""aphelion"" truly refers to the furthest distance between an orbiting body and a primary body (in this case the Earth and the sun), the claim that this will cause abnormally cold weather and more sickness is false. Furthermore, the dates mentioned in this post are inaccurate. While this February 2022 text claims that the aphelion will start ""tomorrow,"" in reality the aphelion won't take place until July this year, and the math is off by millions of miles. While it may seem logical to believe that the Earth is coldest when it is furthest from the sun, that's not actually the case. The Earth is actually further from the sun in July and closer to the sun in January. The tilt of the Earth, not the varying distance from the sun, has a much larger impact on temperatures and the changing of seasons. As Space.com explains:If you were to ask people in which month Earth is closest to the sun, most probably would guess June, July or August. But the warm weather doesn't relate to the Earth's distance from the sun. It's because of the 23.5-degree tilt of the Earth's axis that the sun is above the horizon for different lengths of time at different seasons. The tilt determines whether the sun's rays strike the planet at a low angle or more directly.This viral copypasta gets some other basic facts wrong about the Earth's orbit. In addition to incorrectly stating when the aphelion occurs, it claims that the Earth is ""5 light minutes"" or 90,000,000 kilometers (about 56 million miles) away from the sun. This is wrong.On average, the Earth is about 93 million miles (about 150 million kilometers) away from the sun, or a little more than 8 light-minutes. As the earth's orbit is elliptical, the distance between the Earth and the sun varies throughout the year. During the perihelion, the closet point between the Earth and the sun, the planets are separated by about 91.5 million miles. At the aphelion, the earth is about 3 million miles further away. This is about a 7% difference, not 66% as claimed in this post. The Planetarium at the University of Southern Maine explains that this 3 million-mile difference is not enough to impact temperatures:Its distance veers from its minimum distance (perihelion), which it reaches in early January, to aphelion, which it reaches in early July. It is logical to assume that Earth would necessarily be hotter at perihelion than aphelion. However, the difference in the amount of the Sun's energy we receive (called the solar constant) doesn't vary considerably between perihelion and aphelion. After all, the distance difference between perihelion and aphelion is only about three million miles, a small fraction of Earth's average 93 million mile heliocentric distance.Nothing. "	false
3585	A Pennsylvania man successfully cast a vote in his dead mother’s name for U.S. President Donald Trump during the 2020 presidential election.	"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.There have been many wide-ranging allegations surrounding voter fraud in the United States’ 2020 presidential elections, particularly from Republicans, who allege that voter fraud by Democrats was ""widespread,"" despite a dearth of concrete evidence.In December 2020, one known case of a dead voter was discovered in a Pennsylvania county by officials, but the posthumous vote wasn't for Democratic U.S. President-elect Joe Biden. A man in Delaware County was found to have carried out election fraud by registering and voting as his dead mother for incumbent President Donald Trump, a Republican.Bruce Bartman was charged with unlawful voting and perjury, in what was the only documented case of an actual ballot cast in the name of a verified dead person in that county during the 2020 election. It was the third reported case of election fraud in the state of Pennsylvania. According to a statement from the district attorney for the county, Jack Stollsteimer:Voter records show that on August 20, 2020 Mr. Bartman used the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s online Voter Registration portal to register both his deceased mother, Elizabeth Bartman and his deceased mother-in-law, Elizabeth Weihman, who died in 2019. Mr. Bartman is a registered Repubican and he illegally registered both deceased individuals as Republican voters.Ultimately, Bartman submitted an online request for just one absentee ballot for his deceased mother, which he fraudulently filled out in her name and cast for Trump, and the vote was counted for the November election. He admitted to registering the names of his deceased relatives and filling out his deceased mother's absentee ballot. Bartman was arraigned in mid-December, and released on $100,000 unsecured bail. If convicted on all charges, the 70-year-old man could face up to 19 years in prison.Voter fraud occurs but is extremely rare in the United States. Snopes has covered alleged voter fraud stories before. Stollsteimer added, “For all the conspiracy theorists out there, this case today does not represent widespread voter fraud. This case was evidence that one person committed voter fraud by casting an improper and illegal ballot.” Trump’s campaign flagged Elizabeth Bartman’s name as an alleged case of voter fraud in an email blast to their supporters back in November."	true
1380	"Surveillance video from inside Robb Elementary School on May 24, 2022, showed a man in a protective vest marked ""Sheriff"" using hand sanitizer about an hour after the gunman entered the school and started firing."	"In an email to Snopes on July 14, 2022, Uvalde County Sheriff Ruben Nolasco said the man in the video was employed by the Uvalde County Sheriff's Office, and that ""the reason for him sanitizing his hands was because he was assisting the medical team, prior to officers engaging the shooter.""On July 12, 2022, a rumor surfaced on Twitter that a ""police officer"" who had responded to the May 24 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, allegedly paused during the bloodshed to use a hand-sanitizer dispenser on the school's hallway wall. Snopes readers asked us to investigate the legitimacy of the claim — which contained several facts, as well as an initially unverified assumption about the man's occupation.It was true that surveillance footage, obtained and published by local journalists on July 12, depicted a man using hand sanitizer in a hallway about an hour after the gunman entered the school and began firing on May 24. The man in the video was wearing protective gear that matched the uniforms of Uvalde County sheriff's deputies, though he was not wearing the same shirt-pants uniform as them. Instead, he wore a checkered shirt underneath a vest that had the stitched word ""SHERIFF"" on it. In an email to Snopes on July 14, Uvalde County Sheriff Ruben Nolasco said the man was employed by the Uvalde County Sheriff's Office, and that ""the reason for him sanitizing his hands was because he was assisting the medical team, prior to officers engaging the shooter.""In the roughly 80-minute surveillance video, the man in the checkered shirt and protective vest could be seen walking over to a wall-mounted hand sanitizer dispenser at the 1:02:14 mark. (The video below begins at that moment.) The clip was obtained exclusively by the Austin American-Statesman and local TV-station, KVUE.This video contains disturbing content and viewer discretion is strongly advised:Near the beginning of the surveillance video, at around the five-minute mark in the above-linked YouTube clip, the gunman (18-year-old Salvador Ramos) could be seen at a classroom door. Uniformed law-enforcement officers were shown arriving at the same classroom door just two minutes and 40 seconds later. However, officers did not enter the classroom until more than an hour later, the footage showed. It was during that time that the unidentified man in protective gear used the hand-sanitizer dispenser hanging on a hallway wall, near the classroom.In total, the surveillance footage showed that around 77 minutes passed between the moment the shooter entered the classroom and when officers engaged with him.Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the mass shooting in Uvalde. Joe Garcia, the husband of slain teacher Irma Garcia, also suffered a fatal heart attack two days after the incident. A family member attributed his death to grief.We previously published a number of stories that looked into various rumors about the Uvalde school shooting. For example, within days of the deadly incident, Facebook users were sharing a highly misleading post about the gunman under the title, ""More oddities re: TX School Shooter."" The viral copypasta was not about defending the shooter from scrutiny. Rather, the post appeared to be designed as something that could be shared among strong supporters of the Second Amendment. The post attempted, with multiple unconfirmed rumors and falsehoods, to call attention to an unsubstantiated conspiracy to ""end"" the Second Amendment."	true
837	A photograph shows a man holding a 3-foot grasshopper.	"For several years, a black-and-white photograph purporting to show a man holding an enormous grasshopper has been widely shared on social media: Moreover, if the image were real, the grasshopper would cast a shadow on the man's pants and on the ground, in the same direction as the man's shadow. An uncropped version of the photograph shows that it was copyrighted in 1937 to Coles Studio:Grasshopper shot near Miles City Mont. C. 1937 Coles Studio Glassgow MontThe use of the copyright and the fact that other variations of this image were attached to various locales (such as North Dakota), indicate that this image may have originally circulated as a postcard. In fact, giant grasshoppers were a recurring theme in exaggerated postcards from the early 20th century. Here's an image created by photographer Frank D. ""Pop"" Conard featuring a similarly large (and unreal) grasshoppers:The Kansas Historical Society explains:When a swarm of grasshoppers descended on Garden City in 1935, Frank D. ""Pop"" Conard had a vision. The photographer made a montage of giant insects with humans and sold the postcards like ""hotcakes."" ""The idea,"" Conard said, ""came to me after a flight of grasshoppers swarmed into Garden City attracted by the lights, and it was impossible to fill an automobile gasoline tank at filling stations that night. I went home to sleep, but awoke at 3:00 a.m. and all I could think about was grasshoppers. By morning I had the idea of having fun with the grasshoppers, and took my pictures and superimposed the hoppers with humans. I didn't do it for adverse impressions of Kansas, but as an exaggerated joke."" A master retoucher, Conard continued to print ""hopper whoppers"" until his retirement in 1963. Grasshoppers were enlarged to battle a man, fit on the bed of a pickup, and hold up a train.The picture postcard presented the possibility to inventive photographers to extend the traditional tall-tale to the photographic plate, and what is more, to devise entirely new forms that were possible only through photography. It brought into being visual effects that tall-tale tellers through the centuries had seen only in their fertile imaginations.""They say pictures don't lie,"" explained Conard, ""but from the sale of these postcards-the fastest selling novelty cards on the market it seems that Kansas people like a little funny, untruth.""Although Conard was the giant grasshopper guru of the 1930s, he did not create the postcard featuring the hunter holding a three-foot grasshopper. However, we found two other examples of the work of Coles Studio:Instagram user Blake Nass shared an interesting, although unverified, story about the photograph in 2015. Nass claimed to be the grandson of the man in the photograph, Joseph Nass, and said that the picture was taken after an unsuccessful hunt:I'd be happy to pass along the story. @benshap is pretty close. Grandpa Nass was out shooting prairie dogs/gophers near miles city. Along came a truck loaded with a photographer traveling cross country and asked Mr. Nass to ""hold out his left hand like so and his right hand and rifle just the same"". A few exposures were taken and the photographer (presuming to be associated with Cole studio) said ""thanks, appreciate your time!"" and kept driving along. Grandpa Nass was a little unsure of what had taken place but carried on. A few months later the ""doctored"" photo appeared in some tabloid literature. Postcards primarily that poked fun at country types. At one time the media gave the photo a run with the story involving an Australian being the one posing with a trophy ""hopper"". An original photo held within the family coming soon!! At least part of Nass's story is verifiable. In September 1937, the Tomah Moniror-Herald published a story claiming that giant grasshoppers were terrorizing a local farmer's land. Leland Gregory recounted the story of the hoax in his book Stupid History: Tales of Stupidity, Strangeness, and Mythconceptions Through the Ages:On September 9, 1937, the front-page headliner of the Tomah Monitor Herald warned people: ""Giant Grasshoppers Invade Butts Orchard East of City."" The article explained that grasshoppers had eaten special plant food used on an apple orchard belonging to farmer A.L. Butts and had quickly grown to three feet in length. Accompanying the article were photographs of shotgun-toting hunters tracking down the mutant insects as well as a picture of Farmer Butts holding up a dead grasshopper like a prize fish. The citizens of the town became jumpy and nearly hysterical at the thought of enormous grasshoppers bouncing through the town, destroying their crops, frightening the livestock, and generally wreaking havoc. The article, of course, was a hoax, and the Monitor-Hearld publisher, B.J. Fuller, along with Farmer Butts (yes, there was an actual Farmer Butts,) confessed to making the townsfolk the butt of their elaborate, and pesky, joke. "	false
921	"Whirlpool Corporation and KitchenAid recalled attachments for its popular stand mixers due to ""extreme amounts of lead."""	"In January 2023, we received reader mail that asked about a purported recall of KitchenAid stand mixers, apparently due to lead concerns associated with ""white paddles and hook attachments."" This rumor appeared to stem, at least in part, from blogs.Here's what we know: We've found no evidence that Whirlpool Corporation, which owns the KitchenAid brand, has issued any recalls of the components for the mixers due to lead or anything else at all. From everything we could gather, no current recalls, recent recalls, or quality initiatives existed for the product.In terms of KitchenAid mixers containing lead, we found that the company had made mention of customer concerns on social media in the months and years prior to this current controversy. All of this data is documented below, as is a list of questions we sent to the company.As readers are no doubt aware, one place that a lot of rumors spread, this one included, is on social media.One Facebook post from Jan. 22 appeared to report the news of a lead recall for KitchenAid mixer components, specifically ""white paddles"" and ""hook attachments."" As of Jan. 24, it had more than 30,000 shares, which perhaps meant that it had been seen by at least hundreds of thousands of users.Here's what the post falsely claimed about there being a recall for the stand mixer attachments:KITCHEN AID RECALL - NOT A JOKEATTENTION: Anyone who has a Kitchenaid Mixer with a white paddle and hook attachments. Stop using it immediately! It contains extreme amounts of lead!! The Stainless Steel is ok. You can call the Kitchen Aid number and they will replace it with a metal ones for free. 1-800-541-6390 or 1-800-474-8007. I did it it was super easy! Give them the code on your mixer and they replace them. The calls takes less then 5 minutes!Bear in mind that this single post was just one of a seemingly endless number of others, some of which also each had thousands of shares.In other words, this rumor was spreading like wildfire, despite there being no evidence or sources included with the posts.As can be seen on the Whirlpool Corporation website, no current or recent recall existed for anything involving KitchenAid mixers.In January 2023, users who asked the company about the rumor of lead in its mixer attachments received a brief response from KitchenAid customer support.On the company's social media pages, and apparently also over the phone, customers were told the following:Throughout our 111-year history, Whirlpool Corporation has been committed to providing safe products for our consumers.The company's aluminum alloy stand mixer accessories, including beaters, dough hooks, and whisks, are tested through a third-party, independent laboratory to ensure they comply with all applicable regulations in the locations where they are sold regarding lead content. They are safe for any family's cooking needs.In addition, all current models of aluminum stand mixer accessories have a food-safe coating over the aluminum that is tested both for lead content and lead migration to ensure that it is safe for all consumers.Here's an example of how the company was responding on Twitter with an image that contained the statement:A slightly different statement was shared with a customer back in November 2022.In this case, the statement mentioned California's Proposition 65, which the company also mentioned on its website.Note: The long name for Prop 65 is the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986.Here's the statement, which we've combined into one paragraph after it was originally spread out into three tweets:Proposition 65 requires warning labels on any product that may contain or produce any of the 600-plus elements that the California Air Resources Board considers carcinogenic or a reproductive toxicant. These elements include lead (contained in the solder used to attach electronic parts to the printed circuit boards), brass, PVC and a multitude of other everyday elements and gas products burn fuels (natural gas or propane) that contain trace levels of chemicals on the list. This list also contains a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals, including common household products, foods, drugs, dyes and solvents.Additionally, back in November 2020, the company responded to a man who asked, ""Do you have stand mixers that are lead-free?""In their answer, KitchenAid customer support responded with, ""Unfortunately, we do not, the stand mixers have lead (contained in the solder used to attach electronic parts to the printed circuit boards).""By email, we contacted MSL Group, the public relations firm for KitchenAid products. We posed a series of questions.For example, we inquired about the false rumor of an announced recall of KitchenAid mixer attachments. We also asked about the purported dangers of the product supposedly containing hazardous amounts of lead."	false

4883	Ted Livingston, the CEO of Kik Interactive, announced in September 2019 that the Kik messaging app would be shutting down.	On Sept. 24, 2019, a number of news outlets reported that the messaging app Kik would be shutting down. According to the BBC:Kik Messenger is shutting down despite the service having millions of active users around the world.The company said it was closing down the messaging service so it could concentrate on the Kin cryptocurrency it has also created.The news came as a shock to many Kik users, especially because, as of this writing, an official statement about the messenger app shutting down had not been posted to the company's website or official Twitter or Facebook pages. To confuse matters further, an unrelated hoax about Ted Livingston, the CEO of Kik Interactive, was circulated in the aftermath of these reports.    Livingston announced that the Kik messenger app was closing in a Medium blog post published on Sept. 23 about the company's legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the cryptocurrency Kin. Livingston wrote that the company's legal fight with the SEC had drained resources and led to some hard decisions, such as closing down the messenger app. Livingston wrote (emphasis ours): After 18 months of working with the SEC the only choice they gave us was to either label Kin a security or fight them in court. Becoming a security would kill the usability of any cryptocurrency and set a dangerous precedent for the industry. So with the SEC working to characterize almost all cryptocurrencies as securities we made the decision to step forward and fight.While we are ready to take on the SEC in court, we underestimated the tactics they would employ. How they would take our quotes out of context to manipulate the public to view us as bad actors. How they would pressure exchanges not to list Kin. And how they would draw out a long and expensive process to drain our resources.Instead of selling some of our Kin into the limited liquidity that exists today, we made the decision to focus our current resources on the few things that matter most. So today we are announcing three things:These are hard decisions. Kik is one of the largest apps in the US. It has industry leading engagement and is growing again. Over 100 employees and their families will be impacted. People who have poured their hearts and souls into Kik and Kin for over a decade.Livingston provided few details about the shuttering of Kik. Some Kik users reported encountering a message on the chat app about Kik shutting down on Sept. 27, but a spokesperson for the company told us that this was not an official message from the Kik team: We can confirm that Kik will be shutting down but the timing and details of the user experience has not yet been shared - that will be released in the coming days.	true
4218	The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic caused a nationwide shortage of U.S. coins in circulation during the summer of 2020.	"In the summer of 2020, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports and social media posts that referred to an ongoing shortage of coins across the United States. National and regional news outlets published stories that described such an overall pattern, or specific examples of it, in June and July.Those references to a nationwide coin shortage were well-founded. In a June 11 news release, the U.S. Federal Reserve acknowledged the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic had significantly diminished the U.S. coin supply. That's primarily because members of the public had not been able to visit the places where they typically deposit coins, like retail stores, and exchange them for larger cash denominations (thus removing those coins from circulation) but also because the virus had put a strain on coin production at the U.S. Mint. The statement read:""The COVID‐19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the supply chain and normal circulation patterns for U.S. coin. In the past few months, coin deposits from depository institutions to the Federal Reserve have declined significantly and the U.S. Mint’s production of coin also decreased due to measures put in place to protect its employees. Federal Reserve coin orders from depository institutions have begun to increase as regions reopen, resulting in the Federal Reserve’s coin inventory being reduced to below normal levels.""... The Federal Reserve is working on several fronts to mitigate the effects of low coin inventories. This includes managing the allocation of existing Fed inventories, working with the Mint, as issuing authority, to minimize coin supply constraints and maximize coin production capacity, and encouraging depository institutions to order only the coin they need to meet near‐term customer demand.""On June 17, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell used the word ""shortages"" to describe the situation, saying that the ""flow of coins through the economy"" had ""kind of stopped."" Asked whether he was aware of a coin shortage in Tennessee and elsewhere, Powell told the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services:""Yes, I am aware of it. I'm very much aware of it, and let me say what's happened is that with the partial closure of the economy, the flow of coins through the economy has gotten all — it's kind of stopped.  The places where you go to give your coins and get credit [inaudible] and get cash, you know, folding money — those have not been working, stores have been closed, so the whole system of flow has kind of come to a stop. We're well aware of this. We're working with the [U.S.] Mint, and we're working with the [Federal] Reserve banks, and as the economy reopens we're seeing coins begin to move around again.""Pressed by U.S. Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn., on whether the problem was temporary or pointed to larger structural issues, Powell insisted it was only temporary:""We believe it's just temporary. It's due to the fact of the economy being, in significant part, closed, as I mentioned. And the flow of coins through the economy ... Now we're beginning to see those shortages. We've been aware of it, we're working with the Mint to increase supply and working with the Reserve banks to get that supply where it needs to be. So we think it's temporary, a temporary situation.""https://youtu.be/NdoUUemsZo8?t=3882
 
On June 30, the Federal Reserve provided an update on its joint efforts, with the U.S. Mint, to combat the shortage of coins in circulation throughout the United States, announcing it had established a U.S. Coin Task Force to help coordinate those efforts:""The primary issue with coin is a dramatic deceleration of coin circulation through the supply chain. As of April 2020, the U.S. Treasury estimates that the total value of coin in circulation is $47.8 billion, up from $47.4 billion as of April 2019. While there is adequate coin in the economy, the slowed pace of circulation has meant that sufficient quantities of coin are not readily available where needed.

"In late March 2021, various social media users and outlets fanned internet outrage with false claims that England's renowned University of Oxford would stop teaching students to read musical notation from sheet music, thanks to woke culture.Alarmist takes included headlines like, ""Oxford University may stop teaching sheet music because of its 'complicity in white supremacy'"" from right-leaning Canadian website Post Millennial. ""If the woke have their way, soon we won’t have ANY culture to speak of,"" an op-ed headline from the New York Post said. ""SHEET MUSIC IS RACIST, COLONIAL SAY PSYCHOTIC, TALENTLESS 'PROFESSORS' OF MUSIC!"" tweeted right-leaning commentator Michael Savage.Not true, a spokesperson for the university said. Oxford spokesman Stephen Rouse told The Associated Press that the elite institution has not considered any proposal that would halt the study of musical notation or sheet music reading.The takes claiming Oxford would be banning sheet music thanks to ""the woke"" were aggregated from a March 27, 2021, story published by The Telegraph, a British newspaper. The story was headlined, ""Musical notation branded 'colonialist' by Oxford professors hoping to 'decolonise' the curriculum."" Citing documents and unnamed ""professors,"" the Telegraph reported:Documents reveal that faculty members, who decide on courses that form the music degree, have proposed reforms to address this ""white hegemony"", including rethinking the study of musical notation because it is a ""colonialist representational system"".Teaching notation which has not ""shaken off its connection to its colonial past"" would be a ""slap in the face"" for some students, documents state, and music-writing studies have been earmarked for rebranding to be more inclusive.The Telegraph also noted that academics were ""deconstructing"" the university's music program ""after facing pressure to 'decolonise' the curriculum following the Black Lives Matter protests of the spring and summer of 2020,"" and that the ""development of Western classical music and its notation predate the establishment of the trade in African slaves, both having their roots in Medieval liturgical music like Greogorian chanting.""Rouse told The Associated Press, however, that, ""No such proposal or suggestion has been made about sheet music or western musical notation to stop teaching students to read sheet music."" Rouse also said that ""many of the views the Telegraph article attributed to 'professors' came from a single individual.""And while Rouse told the AP that Oxford plans to expand its offerings to reflect a more globally and culturally diverse musical landscape, those plans have been ongoing ""for the past couple of years."" That would predate the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020.We reached out to Oxford asking whether it's true that the idea of restructuring the university's music program was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement and protests sparked by high-profile killings of Black Americans by police, namely George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. We didn't get an answer in time for publication but will update this story if we do."	false
2845	Video shows that U.S. President Joe Biden faked driving a Ford truck that was actually being controlled by a second steering wheel.	"On May 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden stopped by the Ford River Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan, to tour the company's production facility for the new all-electric F-150 Lightning. At the end of the visit, Biden said that he was a ""car guy"" and that he would like to test drive the new vehicle. Ford obliged, and the president took a spin in the new electric vehicle, saying at the end of the ride that ""this sucker's quick.""Here's a video of Biden's test drive from The Associated Press:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZE4_YXGBiI&t=50sWhile this moment was largely uneventful (although some took issue with a joke Biden made about hitting a reporter), hyperpartisan news outlets and social media personalities claimed that this video actually documented a deepening conspiracy about Biden's health. The website Gateway Pundit published a slow-motion clip taken from C-SPAN's footage and claimed that it showed how Biden was ""faking"" this test drive, and that the truck was actually being controlled by the person in the passenger seat via a second steering wheel. The Gateway Pundit wrote:WOW! Biden Caught Fake Driving — Someone Else Is Steering Vehicle — It Was All a Stunt! — VIDEO and PICS[...]Following his speech, the declining septuagenarian was put in an electric vehicle where he pretended to be driving. This was all a show by his handlers to make Joe Biden look like he’s in charge.Biden did not ""fake"" drive this truck, and this all-electric vehicle was not equipped with two steering wheels. Mike Levine, Ford North America product communications manager, confirmed to the automative news website Jalopnik  that “there was no other set of controls"" in the vehicle Biden drove. The object the Gateway Pundit claims the passenger is holding in this video is not a steering wheel. It's a camera. It appears that the secret service agent was simply reaching out to make sure that this camera didn't fall off the dashboard. Here's an enlarged image showing this moment. The Gateway Pundit's main piece of ""evidence"" for the double-driver conspiracy theory is superimposed in the top left:Furthermore, other images exist showing other angles of the drive that make it clear this vehicle didn't have two steering wheels. At the end of the above-displayed video from The Associated Press, for instance, you can get a glimpse through the windshield that shows Biden's hands on the steering wheel and no steering wheel visible on the passenger side. At another moment, we get a view through the passenger side windows which, again, shows Biden with his hands on the wheel and the passenger without a steering wheel. This moment is more clearly visible in the original video from from C-SPAN. https://www.c-span.org/video/?511860-101/president-biden-test-drives-ford-electric-vehicle The claim that Biden ""fake"" drove this vehicle can also be disproven by the fact that this drive wasn't entirely scheduled. If you noticed in these videos, there is some odd material hanging on the side of this all-electric F-150 Lightning. This is not part of the design of the vehicle that will be available for purchase. This is a sort of camouflage that the company uses to obscure the public's view of vehicles before they are officially released. The Detroit Free Press reported that Ford had to scramble a little after Biden asked to test drive one of their vehicles.President Biden, 78, whose father sold Fords back in the day, wrapped up his remarks on Tuesday at the new plant in the Rouge complex designed to build the all-electric F-150 Lightning and it all seemed routine to those present.Until it wasn't.""At the end of his speech, he kinda turned to everyone, he goes, 'You know I'm a car guy. And I want to drive this truck.' Everyone politely laughed. Because presidents don't drive vehicles,'"" Ford CEO Jim Farley told the Free Press ... And then it happened.""Lo and behold, I get a tap on my shoulder (apparently from White House staff) at the very end of the event,"" Farley said. ""They said, 'Mr. Farley, we'd like you to come with us to the motorcade because we want to go to the test track and drive the truck.""So Farley and chief engineer Linda Zhang went together to a Ford test track nearby.""All the media was there. And the whole presidential motorcade,"" Farley said. ""We’ve never had the presidential motorcade at our test track before. I think all our team members were kind of stunned to see the president of the United States come to the test track. We didn’t really have any warning.""""It was a game time decision,"" said Mark Truby, global head of Ford communications."	false
3554	A photograph shows frozen noodles and a frozen egg suspended in air during extreme cold temperatures in Novosibirsk, Russia.	In December 2020, a photograph showing a plate of noodles and a cracked egg that supposedly froze solid while suspended in air due to extremely cold temperatures in Novosibirsk, Russia, was widely circulated on social media:We haven't been able to find too many specifics about this picture. However, this appears to be its first posting. Twitter user @Olegsvn has tweeted about his hometown of Novosibirsk before, and temperatures truly did dip into the negative 40s in the final week of December.We don't see any reason to be skeptical about the claim in this tweet, especially since Oleg is not the first person to create this sort of frozen food display. Several photographs, videos, and news stories have been published over the years about people creating similar frozen-food sculptures in cold weather climates. Cyprien Verseux, a glaciologist and astrobiologist who spent time working at the Concordia Station in Antarctica in 2019, shared several photographs of various frozen-food sculptures to demonstrate just how cold it was in Antarctica.Verseux wrote (translated from French via Google):Average temperatures on Mars are -60 ° C. Those of Concordia during the winter, too.During the coldest months, the base drags for a long time below -70 ° C. The mercury would sometimes drop - if the cold had not solidified it - below -80 ° C. The wind can lower the temperature felt below -100 ° C.These figures are surprising but, for many, hardly evocative: how to imagine a cold so far removed from what one has ever known?We have therefore decided to illustrate it, with the following pictures as a result.	true

2002	"Actor Val Kilmer, while portraying gunslinger Doc Holliday in the 1993 Western film ""Tombstone,"" repeated the catchphrase, ""I'm your huckle bearer,"" not ""I'm your huckleberry,"" as is commonly thought."	"Actor Val Kilmer so iconically embodied 19th century gunslinger Doc Holliday in the movie ""Tombstone"" that when he said the line ""I'm your huckleberry,"" it became part of popular culture. The phrase remains popular, even nearly three decades since the film's 1993 release.But the popularity of the phrase had some wondering — did they misremember the exact words spoken by Kilmer in the movie, or did everyone hear it wrong the first time, and have been quoting the line erroneously ever since, in a classic case of Mandela Effect?Some have taken to social media to express the belief that Kilmer really said, ""I'm your huckle bearer,"" as in one popular 2021 TikTok video: We acknowledge that, as spoken in the movie, the last syllable in the word ""huckleberry"" may be ripe for interpretation because Kilmer is using a Southern accent and pronouncing it more like ""huckleberr-uh.""We can confirm he actually said ""huckleberry,"" not ""huckle bearer,"" because he said so himself on social media in 2014:But if the source of the quote himself isn't enough to convince some, the ""Tombstone"" script can be found online, where readers can confirm for themselves that the line is ""I'm your huckleberry,"" not ""I'm your huckle bearer.""Kilmer also titled his memoir, you guessed it, ""I'm Your Huckleberry.""Doc Holliday was a real historical figure who lived from 1851 to 1887. Born John Henry Holliday, he had aristocratic Southern roots and trained as a dentist, making his way out West where he gained a reputation as a gunfighter, gambler, and friend of Wyatt Earp. Holliday and his companions are famous for their role in the shootout at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona.Some believe that if the real Doc Holliday said any such phrase, it would have been ""I'm your huckle bearer,"" because, they assert, the term ""huckle bearer"" was at that time the equivalent of ""pallbearer,"" and Holliday, a famous gunfighter, would have meant it as a threat.""In the South, a huckle was a casket handle. A huckle bearer would be the person carrying a coffin, essentially a pallbearer,"" the travel website Texas Hill Country reported in 2020.Some sources indicate that ""I'm your huckleberry,"" in the sense used in the movie, was an idiom in the South in the 1800s and meant, more or less, the right person who was up for whatever job or action was being proposed.The phrase is used, for example, in the 1883 novel, ""The Bread-Winners: A Social Study,"" by John Hay. In the book, the character Sam Sleeny utters the phrase when being complimented by another character, John Offitt."	false
2376	A video shows Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla saying that the COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips.	"In 2018, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla mentioned a pill that had been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration a few months prior that contained a digital sensor that could track whether or not the medicine had been taken. This product was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Contrary to online rumors, this comment was completely unrelated to vaccines or the COVID-19 pandemic. Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. 
In December 2021, a video supposedly showing Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla talking about microchips in the COVID-19 vaccine started to circulate on social media. A number of social media users posted this video with a copied and pasted piece of text that read: ""Pfizer CEO Bourla talking about the microchip that will be in medications. Sounds normal right?? Just a conspiracy theory?? #Pfizer #Vaccines.""This video was taken in 2018, years before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and has nothing to do with COVID-19 vaccines. This video was taken during the World Economic Forum in 2018. A guest asked the panel about how medical professionals could better engage with patients, noting that even if they made the best medicine that there was ""no guarantee that the patient was going to take the drug."" Bourla responded by saying that the FDA had recently approved a pill that contained a digital sensor which could track if the medicine had been ingested. Bourla said: ""Maybe I will use an example. I think it is fascinating what is happening in this field right now. The FDA approved the first electronic pill, if I can call it that, it's basically a biological chip that is in the tablet and once you take the table it sends a signal that you took the tablet. Imagine the implications of that compliance. The insurance companies can know that the medicines that patients should take they do take them. It is fascinating what happens in this field.""Bourla appears to be referring to Abilify MyCite, an aripiprazole tablet with a sensor that detects when a pill has been ingested that was approved by the FDA a few months before this video was taken.Regarding the tablet, the FDA wrote in a release:The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the first drug in the U.S. with a digital ingestion tracking system. Abilify MyCite (aripiprazole tablets with sensor) has an ingestible sensor embedded in the pill that records that the medication was taken. The product is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute treatment of manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and for use as an add-on treatment for depression in adults.The system works by sending a message from the pill’s sensor to a wearable patch. The patch transmits the information to a mobile application so that patients can track the ingestion of the medication on their smart phone. Patients can also permit their caregivers and physician to access the information through a web-based portal.“Being able to track ingestion of medications prescribed for mental illness may be useful for some patients,” said Mitchell Mathis, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The FDA supports the development and use of new technology in prescription drugs and is committed to working with companies to understand how technology might benefit patients and prescribers.”Bourla was not talking about vaccines, he was not talking about COVID-19, and he was not talking about microchips. The CEO of Pfizer was talking about a new product that could help mental illness patients and caregivers track when medication had been ingested. The full exchange can be viewed below, starting at the 45:20 mark:This clip was widely shared on social media as if it contained some sort of ""gotcha"" moment proving that the conspiratorial notion that the vaccines contain microchips is real. If Bourla was talking about microchips in medicine in 2018, the flawed argument holds, then of course they're being added to the COVID-19 vaccines. There are a number of flaws in this argument. For starters, Bourla was not talking about ""microchips."" While ""microchip"" has become a bit of an all-encompassing term, it is generally used in conspiracy theory contexts to refer to a ""tracking device"" that has been secretly inserted into an unwilling individual. But that's not the case here. This sensor does not track a person's whereabouts or do anything other than send an alert to a phone that a medicine has been ingested.These conspiracy theories often hinge on notions of secrecy and underhanded plots, yet the evidence provided tends to point back to publicly available FDA news releases. In the video above, for example, Bourla is talking about a product that was approved by the FDA. The FDA has also issued releases regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, and none of those make any mention of microchips. You can read more about the ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccines in a previous article. Furthermore, the fact that microchips and biosensors exist is not proof that they exist in  COVID-19 vaccine. In the video above, Bourla is simply discussing a recent development in the biosensor field. This is not evidence that biosensors are also in the COVID-19 vaccine and in the video above Bourla makes no such claim. "	false

Only 8% of black voters picked Mr. Trump in 2016, and his support among black voters was just 10% in a recent Quinnipiac poll.Mr. Trump made the case that Democrats are only interested in African-Americans for their votes every four years, saying they ""don't fight"" for the African-American community.

The grinning couple wore matching white T-shirts with black lettering that read “blacks for trump.” Joiner, who is black, said, “my homegirl took the pic” of the couple, which Joiner later posted on Instagram, “cause I was too in awe of the situation.” In the caption, Joiner referred to the scene as being something out of “The Twilight Zone.”In fact, the couple was in the building for the inaugural Black Voices for Trump rally, which was going to begin a few hours later, in a nearby room."	true
3714	A video shows a bright purple sky in Sweden.	"In November 2020, videos and photographs purportedly showing a bright purple sky in Sweden started circulating on social media:These are genuine images showing a purple sky over the town of Trelleborg, Sweden, in late November 2020. This visual may bring about thoughts of some sort of natural phenomena, but the culprit behind these purple skies is actually a nearby tomato farm. SVT, Sweden's national public television company, reported on Nov. 24 that these purple skies appeared after a new energy-saving LED system was installed at a tomato farm in nearby Gislöv. The lights were meant to extend the farm's growing season, but they had an unexpected side effect: purple skies. SVT writes:A light phenomenon amuses and worries the inhabitants of Gislöv's location. A strong purple light that now the environmental manager in Trelleborg has on his table.Tomato cultivation outside Gislöv's location in southern Skåne is one of Sweden's largest and has changed lighting to more energy-saving LED lamps with a new purple glow that should be good for the plants. The lamp system also extends the growing season.While the images above may appear eerily beautiful when viewing them online, the residents of Trelleborg weren't thrilled about the light pollution. Alfred Pedersen & Son, the company that owns the farm, said that it did not intend to anger the local residents and that it was working on a solution for the lights. For the moment, the company said that it would stop using the lights at night. Here's a video from TRT World showing these purple skies in Sweden:This tomato farm, of course, is not the first to install powerful LED lights to aid the cultivation of its plants. And the residents of Trelleborg are not the first to deal with these neon-colored skies. Here's an excerpt from a 2017 NPR report about a similar problem in New England:""We love sun,"" says LaDue. ""We expect with our location, latitude and longitude in this part of the country, we should be able to get about 80 percent of our light requirements from the sun.""And the other 20 percent? That comes from high-powered grow lights."	true
2955	A Google Maps Street View car hit a hare or rabbit, as shown in photos taken by one of its cars.	"Some 360-degree pictures on Google Street View showed a hare or rabbit being launched into the air. It appeared to have come into contact with the car that was taking the photographs. As the car drove away, it captured photos of the animal flailing in the air and landing on its back. It's unclear if it survived.In late April 2021, TikTok user @googlemapsfun posted a video of a purported ""super rabbit,"" which appeared to be a hare, caught on a Google Maps Street View camera. The TikTok channel, which concentrates on interesting finds in Google Earth, was viewed 43 million times in its one to two weeks.The audio in the video is quite loud, so we recommend lowering your volume before pressing play. It shows the animal, which was identified as a ""super rabbit"" in the video, appearing to be upright and soaring through the air like a superhero.Absent from the video and most of the comments was information regarding where this happened. We also sought out to learn what happened to the animal.The TikTok video provided only one solid clue: the street name. ""Biała Droga"" was displayed on the ground. This led us to Poland.We found the location at these coordinates: 49°55'04.5""N 19°56'13.3""E (if those don't work in a specific mapping application, they can be input into Google Maps: 49.9179269,19.9370267).The incident appeared to have occurred right around Biała Droga 2-6, 32-040 Olszowice, Poland.Looking at the sequence of 360-degree pictures frame-by-frame showed more than the TikTok video revealed.First, in the initial photograph the animal was moving toward the road: Heading directly onto the roadway.In the next picture, it appeared to have been hit by the front side of the car, perhaps the bumper: It's unclear what speed the car was traveling at.It then showed up on the other side of the car: The nature of how the 360-degree camera captures photographs is why the animal looks stretched in this view.The fourth frame is the moment that was seen in the video, which the TikTok user dubbed ""super rabbit.""For it to get this high and not be a glitch, the animal might have hit the front bumper and then the windshield, launching it into the sky. However, there isn't enough evidence to say for certain how it ended up this high in the air: ""Super rabbit,"" as claimed in the TikTok video.The animal's limbs might have been limp in the fifth photograph as it tossed around in the air: The animal's shadow appeared on the road in a few of the pictures.A pixelation problem was visible in the next picture, but the animal appeared to be upside down as it fell to land on the ground: The animal's head appears to be upside down here.In the seventh and final frame in which the animal was visible, it looked like it landed on its head or back. Its legs were pointing up: It's unclear if the hare or rabbit survived the incident.No more evidence was available, as the animal didn't appear in the next picture as the car continued to drive away.Readers looking to find discussion about the strange moment on Google Maps Street View should look no further than Reddit. The pictures have appeared on Reddit a seemingly endless amount of times in the past.The Reddit threads had varying titles. Some examples included ""Magic bunny,"" ""Rabbit getting hit by google maps car,"" ""flying rabbit caught on google maps!,"" and ""Hare runs across the road in front of Google Maps car."""	true

However, the words ""Beware of Billionaire"" on this sign are written in a different sized font than the ""Beware of Elephants"" sign.The fake sign also has rounded edges, where as the ""elephants"" signs edges are squared.Lastly, you can see the markings where the ""elephants"" sign was installed to the pole. The ""Beware of Billionaire"" sign, on the other hand, has no such markings:A larger version of this image was posted to the Facebook page ""ชมรมแพทย์ชนบท,"" a page supporting rural clinics in Thailand, on 10 February 2018. It appears that the image was cropped in order to remove a watermark reading ""Mao@Muaklek"":Regardless of who was responsible for creating this image, the ""Beware of Billionaire"" sign is fake. The Thai web site Spring News posted a genuine version of this image:The ""Beware of Billionaire"" sign went viral in February 2018 shortly after construction tycoon Premchai Karnasuta was arrested in Thailand for hunting in a protected wildlife sanctuary. The Washington Post reported:The head of one of Thailand’s largest construction companies has been arrested for hunting protected animals in a wildlife sanctuary and was found with the skin of a black panther and other animals, officials announced Tuesday."	false

966	The World Economic Forum was hiring unvaccinated pilots to transport the wealthy and powerful to the annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2023.	"Both COVID-19 vaccines and the World Economic Forum (WEF) are lightning rods for conspiracy theorists. In recent years, the WEF — an annual meeting of wealthy and powerful business and political leaders — has regularly become a central character in conspiracies about a global elite secretly restructuring society in their favor. These so-called ""great reset"" conspiracies often include claims about the COVID-19 pandemic as a tool for the elite to exert their control. In this context, claims about the vaccination status of pilots transporting WEF participants went viral in the days before the WEF officially opened on Jan. 16, 2023. In service of a belief that these ""elites"" know more about the purported dangers and evils of COVID-19 vaccination, several anti-vaccine groups began pushing claims that wealthy participants of the WEF required or had requested non-vaccinated pilots for their safety. The alleged reason? An unfounded assertion that vaccinated pilots have a higher risk of cardiac complications compared to non-vaccinated ones, and therefore they risk ""dying suddenly"" mid-flight. The unfounded assertion that vaccinated airline pilots have a higher risk of dropping dead is a central claim animating a group of commercial pilots named ""U.S. Freedom Flyers."" Snopes investigated similar claims in July and October 2021 and found them without merit. The claim that wealthy elites were requesting unvaccinated pilots for Davos, in this case, stemmed from an interview with Alan Dana, a former commercial pilot, shared on Infowars : In that interview, Dana repeated second-hand information originating, allegedly, from the founder of the U.S. Freedom Flyers, Josh Loder:Former Jetstar pilot Alan Dana claimed the wealthy are seeking out unvaccinated pilots to fly their private jets. Dana said Josh Yoder, the head [of] the U.S. Freedom Flyers, … is receiving inquiries from elites interested in hiring unvaccinated pilots to fly their business trips.This quote generated headlines on similarly disreputable conspiracy outlets suggesting the WEF itself was seeking these pilots. For example, the conspiracy peddler NewsPunch ran a story with the headline: ""WEF Hires Unvaccinated Pilots To Fly Them Into Davos,"" which claimed that WEF Founder and Chairman ""Klaus Schwab … banned vaccinated pilots from transporting … members in and out of Davos due to the safety risk they pose.""Loder, on Twitter, denied ever suggesting that the WEF was seeking these pilots. Instead he said that ""wealthy businessmen have reached out to me for"" the purpose of finding unvaccinated pilots to fly them to Davos. This claim is wholly unverifiable, and comes from an activist who regularly promotes conspiracy theorists while suggesting that Anthony Fauci is a Nazi. Because the WEF is not seeking unvaccinated pilots, and because the alleged source of this claim explicitly rejected that interpretation, the headline claims about the WEF's preference for unvaccinated pilots is ""False."" "	false

"A Cavalier King Charles spaniel was deputized by the Lee County Sheriff’s Office in Florida in December 2020 — just two months after the puppy narrowly escaped the jaws of an alligator.In a Dec. 8 Facebook post, Sheriff Carmine Marceno welcomed the 4-month-old Gunner as the newest canine recruit to the department’s Deputy Dogs program. ""Back in October, Gunner’s owner, Richard, rescued him from the jaws of an alligator swimming in a nearby pond,” wrote the Sheriff’s office. “Gunner’s tenacity and fight for survival prove he’s the perfect candidate as the Safety and Security Officer for Deputy Dogs.""The Lee County Sheriff’s Office program Deputy Dogs, Pets on Patrol is an informal program and educational resource for children that recruits residents and their pets to “serve as community lookouts while out on their daily walks.""But Gunner’s heroic escape from the jaws of an alligator marked him as an excellent candidate for the Deputy Dogs program.Surveillance footage captured in October 2020 showed Gunner’s owner Richard Wilbanks as he chased down an alligator, pulled it from the murky depths of a pond, dragged the reptile back to shore, and rescued the puppy from the animal’s bite.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FrQfONE5zk&feature=youtu.be “We were just out for a Sunday morning stroll by the pond and Gunner, all of a sudden I just, heard him yelp and looked around and saw the alligator swimming out in the pond with him,” said Wilbanks in the Facebook video.“I just wasn’t going to let it have my puppy.”"	true

Over the weekend of April 17-20, 2020, protesters in cities across the U.S. turned out to demonstrate for the loosening of social-distancing restrictions enacted to deal with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, holding that that restrictions were unnecessary or had continued for too long. Those protests encompassed the display of numerous signs and messages that seemed so outrageous in their sentiments as to leave many viewers who encountered them afterwards on social media wondering whether they were real. (Most were in fact real, although a few were fake.)One such example of this phenomenon was the following, an image of an automobile displaying a message on its rear window reading ""Your health is not more important than my liberties!""The license plate on the car appears to be the ""Keep Kids Safe"" variant of vehicle plates issued in Connecticut, and the state capital of Hartford was the scene of a ""Rally to Reopen"" protest on April 20, as reported by the Hartford Courant:Hundreds of Connecticut residents paraded around the state Capitol [on the afternoon of April 20] in their cars, honking horns, flying American flags and displaying signs demanding the state reopen businesses and services that have been shut down during the coronavirus pandemic.The long line of protesting drivers snaked around the Capitol grounds and Frog Hollow neighborhood shortly after Gov. Ned Lamont announced deaths associated with the virus have topped 1,300 and that restrictive measures, including a new order to wear masks in public, should continue for weeks.The loud but socially distant protest in Hartford followed similar large, in-person rallies in state capitals around the country, including in Pennsylvania earlier Monday and in Michigan, Virginia and Texas over the past few days.The protesters nationwide claim Lamont and other governors’ unprecedented orders to shut down businesses, close schools and order millions to stay at home to stem the spread of the virus infringe on civil liberties and do more harm than good for society at large, said Dan Reale, chairman of the Libertarian Party of Connecticut, which organized the rally.One slightly different aspect of the Hartford protest was that it primarily comprised demonstrators driving around in their automobiles rather than gathering in person:The vehicle bearing the ""Your health is not more important than my liberties!"" message was in fact part of that ""Rally to Reopen"" procession in Hartford, having been captured in pictures by photojournalist Brad Horrigan that appeared in both the Courant's reporting on the demonstration and in an separate opinion piece about the protest:[While I lay in a hospital bed in Manhattan, forcing myself to breathe], in Connecticut — my home state — hundreds of people gathered in the capital city. American flags were billowing. Signs were flailing. Red hats were everywhere. I had no idea this was happening, but by the time I got home from the hospital, the photos were all over the Internet.“Your health is not more important than my liberties,” someone had scribbled on a car window. The pain in my chest — which had persisted and grown throughout the last eight days — was now compounded by something else."	true
1169	Historically, U.S. plumbers have received more calls for help on the day after Thanksgiving than on any other day of the year.	"With American households preparing large dinners of turkey, sides, bread, and pies every year for the annual Thanksgiving holiday, it's no surprise that Black Friday has historically been considered the busiest day of the year for plumbers in the U.S.On Nov. 26, 2003, columnist Jeffrey Page with the New Jersey newspaper The Record published that grease and food slipping down kitchen drains, when combined with having houseguests needing to flushing the toilet, can potentially produce a holiday nightmare:If disaster strikes, there's a good chance it'll happen [on the night of Thanksgiving or the following day] as millions of Thanksgiving cooks peel potatoes, shuck the green peas from their pods, prepare the apples for the pie and the pumpkin for the bread, make the gravy, shell the walnuts, wash the broccoli, and heft that mighty turkey from the refrigerator to the sink to the oven.Chances of clogs increase with the amount of food that stands a chance of slipping down the drain. The problem is that a lot of people are oblivious to the hazards of holiday cooking. They're not sure what can, and cannot, be shoved down the garbage disposal. They're not scrupulous about making sure that the little drain basket is in place. They're careless about preventing grease from snaking down through the basket and down the drainpipe, where it coagulates. Of course, there's not much they can do about their guests' need to use the bathroom – except to invite fewer guests.Precisely because so much is cooked for so many people, and because toilets are pushed to their limits, Thanksgiving turns out to be one of the busiest days of the year for plumbers. It's a day when sensible people give thanks for their blessings, one of which, whether they know it or not, is the acquaintance of a responsive plumber.We compiled data from other newspaper articles that were published in the past two days or so. All of the stories reported that the day after Thanksgiving, sometimes referred to as Black Friday by shoppers and ""Brown Friday"" by some plumbers, had historically been the day when plumbers across the country received the most calls for help.On Nov. 22, 2000, Steve Wiegand published a story for The Sacramento Bee with the headline, ""For plumbers, the day after Thanksgiving is no holiday."" The article said that, ""Although there are no hard statistics, interviews with plumbers indicate that the day after Thanksgiving is the busiest day of the year for those who practice the plumbing sciences.""It also added that, as part of a survey, plumbing companies in the Sacramento area all said they saw about a 50 percent increase in calls compared to the average for other days of the year.On Nov. 23, 2007, The Associated Press reported that the national plumbing company Roto-Rooter also mentioned a 50 percent increase in calls. ""The main problems are caused by grease and cooking oil people put in garbage disposals,"" the article said.In order to minimize the strain on drain pipes, it was recommended to wipe grease from pots and pans with paper towels and to throw those towels away in the trash.Note: The same ""50 percent increase in calls"" number was still mentioned as of November 2022 on rotorooter.com.On Nov. 27, 2014, The Californian newspaper in Salinas published an interview with Mary Kennedy Thompson, president of Mr. Rooter Plumbing, whose headquarters are in Waco, Texas.""Black Friday is the busiest day of the year for plumbers,"" Thompson said, adding that ""garbage disposals weren't designed to replace the trash can.""The article also contained a few tips, one of which said to not operate the dishwasher if a problem is suspected, as all of the discharge will come out of the garbage disposal.On Nov. 28, 2019, The Citizen-Times of Asheville, North Carolina, published a story with a mention of ""Brown Friday.""The article began, ""Forget about Black Friday. Plumbers know the day after Thanksgiving as something else altogether: 'Brown Friday,' so-named for the increase in service calls.""The story named 10 food items that consumers shouldn't put down their drains, according to plumbers. They include artichoke leaves, eggshells, carrots, vegetable peels, celery (or any other fibrous vegetable), bones, pineapple rinds, asparagus, coffee grounds, and onion skin.The story from the Citizen-Times also included the following guidance about using store-bought drain cleaners. Some homeowners might opt to try one of the drain cleaning products if they can't get a plumber over to the house quickly. However, Asheville's Blue Planet Plumbing advised against doing so:Should I use drain cleaners?The official word from Blue Planet Plumbing: No. Here's more, from the plumbing company's blog:""The chemicals in many over the counter drain cleaners have high toxicity levels and create fumes that aren't healthy to inhale. These cleaners are also damaging to metallic pipes, often completely destroying them underground or under slab.""Toxic fumes can hang around long after cleaners have gone down the drain, and the harsh chemicals can also eat away at the finishes in your tubs and sink.Even worse, hydrochloric acid, the primary chemical used in many drain cleaners, can corrode underground pipes, leaching toxins into the soil."	true
1362	The same crying woman appears in photos taken at the scenes of massacres in Sandy Hook, Aurora, Boston, Oregon, Paris, and Manchester.	"On Oct. 1, 2015, ten people (nine innocent victims plus the gunman) died in a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. The incident marked the 294th mass shooting in 2015 alone and prompted yet another renewal of a national gun control debate in the U.S.Folks on both sides of that political debate would likely agree that the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 was a pivotal point in a perpetual American gun control controversy. Perhaps due to the unique horrors of that event, an unusually high number of conspiracy theories grew out of it: Some gun control advocates on social media later described the tragedy as proof positive Americans weren't interested in changing gun laws despite the exceptional pain inflicted by the incident, while some gun rights advocates asserted the events in Newtown were a government-sponsored false flag engineered to artificially justify a ""gun grab.""The latter camp wasn't much of a fringe movement — a key law enforcement figure of the Roseburg shooting, Sheriff John Hanlin, had shared Sandy Hook conspiracy material on his own Facebook wall prior to the Umpqua Community College shooting. The Sandy Hook shooting was somewhat of a watershed moment for Second Amendment ""truthers,"" and the conspiracies that sprang forth from it began coloring subsequent (and in some instances, prior) high-profile shootings or attacks on civilians in America.One of the common conspiracy themes that gained traction after the Newtown shooting involved ""crisis actors,"" individuals who had (to that point) been primarily known to populate disaster drills. As the notion of gun grabbing conspiracies became more commonplace, the term was appropriated by folks who believed the faces of those grieving at (staged) shooting scenes or subsequent vigils were in fact paid government operatives assigned to fabricate the appearance of mourning. A common iteration of the rumor involved photographs taken at crime scenes or vigils in Newtown (Connecticut), Aurora (Colorado), Boston:After the 1 October 2015 shooting in Roseburg, the meme was altered to include what was purportedly yet another appearance by the ""same girl"" seen previously crying in photos from Aurora, Boston, and Sandy Hook. (Presumably, the high-level false flag planners didn't have access to social media and remained unaware their schemes had been unraveled and revealed months earlier):The same technology that enabled people to compile and spread the photo set shown above also allowed anyone interested in the rumor to quite quickly determine whether the ""same girl"" was indeed depicted in all four images included in the meme.The claim was bizarre partly because the individuals involved were not nameless, faceless mourners of whom no trace was found shortly after the respective tragedies. The largest of the images was also the most iconic and heartbreaking: the photograph (taken at Sandy Hook Elementary) that captured the moment during which Carlee Soto learned her sister Victoria Soto was among those killed. The image was not the only one available of Carlee Soto crying, but similar, easily discovered images didn't fit the meme:To the right of Soto in the photo collection (which in several iterations is inaccurately labeled as being from ""Boston"") is Amanda Medek. Medek's sister Micayla Medek was among the dead in the 20 July 2012 Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting, and the image of Medek sitting on steps was one of several captured of her that day:Photographs taken during happier times definitively show that Medek (at the far right) and Soto look nothing alike (save for the moments during which each respectively learned their sisters had been murdered):Pictured to the left of Soto is Emma McDonald, who (unlike Soto and Medek) appeared to be connected to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings solely by her presence at a vigil for the victims. As such, McDonald's link to that tragedy was more fleeting (and photographs of her were harder to come by).The young woman shown at the bottom (after the Roseburg shooting) was identified as Jessica Vazquez, seen crying and hugging aunt Leticia Alcaraz. (Alcaraz's daughter Lucero Alcaraz was among the dead at Umpqua Community College):Following a mass shooting in San Bernardino on 2 December 2015 an iteration of the rumor held the ""same girl"" was again spotted amid news coverage of the event, albeit this time in a larger crowd shot:While all the young women seen in the photographs had long, brown hair (initially), that factor alone didn't make a strong case for a massive government conspiracy encompassing law enforcement agencies at several levels in multiple states (and eventually, multiple countries). In May 2017, the conspiracy theory popped up again after 22 people were killed in a bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. The ""same girl"" was purportedly photographed in Manchester but unlike the earlier photos, the depicted individual was blonde. She was not identified in the Reuters image, a caption for which indicated it was taken at a crisis center in Manchester City's Etihad Stadium: The similarities ended with hairstyles and grief-stricken expressions (and in the latter case, the depicted woman was not a brunette). Four of the six women depicted were identified by name at the time they were photographed (the fifth appeared to be a bystander, and the sixth unidentified) and none was transient to the tragedies with which they were associated or disappeared afterwards: Medek and Soto (relatives of victims in tragedies that were not exceptionally recent) went on to appear in multiple photographs and interviews about the respective incidents. In subsequent iterations in Paris and Manchester, the conspiracy broadened in scope to suggest the ""same girl"" was jetted around the globe to visit the scenes of attacks and shootings."	false
4065	"U.S. President Donald Trump said on ""Sean Hannity Radio"" that the United States Postal Service is the most ""anti-American"" way to vote, and that he would try and dismantle it."	"In early August 2020, Snopes readers asked whether the following meme shared across social media accurately quoted U.S. President Donald Trump's commenting on the United States Postal Service and voting by mail:This quote appears to be a fabricated one.Although the meme's text states that Trump made the remark on a talk radio show hosted by Fox News personality Sean Hannity on July 30, 2020, Trump wasn't a guest on  Hannity's AM radio talk show  that day.It's true that Trump has repeatedly disparaged mail-in voting, falsely stating  that voting by mail leads to rampant election fraud (except in Florida). He even appeared to suggest in a tweet, which prompted widespread backlash, that the November 2020 election should be delayed because the widespread use of mail-in ballots during the ongoing pandemic would compromise the results.Some concern has also been expressed that Trump has reduced the effectiveness of the Postal Service with budget cuts, as The New York Times reported: ""Fueled by animus for Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and surrounded by advisers who have long called for privatizing the post office, Mr. Trump and his appointees have begun taking cost-cutting steps that appear to have led to slower and less reliable delivery.""However, we found no evidence that Trump made the remark in the above-displayed meme. It wasn't posted to his Twitter account or recorded in any statements transcribed by the White House. And Trump was not a guest on the Hannity show on July 30, 2020, so he didn't make the remark there, as suggested by the meme.   These words appear to be someone else's paraphrase of what they assumed Trump was thinking or planning."	false
2792	A video shows a construction worker throwing a saw blade through a two-by-four.	"One sign of a great viral video is that it continues to circulate long after it has left the limelight. In May 2021, more than a decade after this video first went viral, we received a query asking if a construction worker really threw a circular saw blade through a two-by-four:This video first went viral in 2009 and has since been viewed nearly 2 million times. Posts on Facebook over the years added hundreds of thousands additional views. But, while this video is undoubtedly popular, it's also undoubtedly fake. This video was created as part of a viral marketing campaign from Martin Williams Advertising for Integrity Windows and Doors from Marvin. The campaign, dubbed ""The Carl and Stu Skills Challenge,""  featured five videos of suspiciously skilled construction workers. We've only been able to locate one other video from this campaign, which featured the tremendous tape-measuring skills of an anonymous construction worker actor:In 2010, Adweek magazine awarded Martin|Williams Advertising with the BUZZ Award. Here's an excerpt from a news release announcing the award:ADWEEK awarded Martin|Williams Advertising with its prestigious 2010 BUZZ Award for the agency's viral marketing campaign for Integrity Windows and Doors from Marvin, which generated more than seven million online views and mentions on ESPN. The BUZZ Award honors national advertising campaigns exhibiting the best in brand integration and the innovative use of media and product placement to resonate with pop culture.""The Carl and Stu Skills Challenge"" – developed by Martin|Williams Advertising – features five videos showcasing builders' unique talents with various tools found on the job site, including manually throwing a saw blade to cut a piece of wood, flinging a tape measure to retrieve a set of keys and operating a nail gun to create a work of art.""In a traditional category, we were able to create a successful, non-traditional campaign that really seemed to create a lot of buzz, sorry,"" said Tom Moudry, CEO, Chief Creative Officer.According to power tool manufacturer Vermont American, a circular saw blade can spin as fast as 10,000 SFPM (surface feet per minute). We're not sure how fast a human-thrown saw blade spins (or if it has ever been measured), but it's not fast enough to saw through wood. In addition to spinning speeds, power tools also have the added benefit of continuing to spin after they meet resistance. Here's a video of what it actually looks like when you throw a saw blade at a piece of wood:"	false
3593	Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church in Texas received $4.4 million in coronavirus-economic-relief loans.

In late December 2020, many on social media reacted angrily when U.S. legislators announced they had passed the first bill in nine months that would provide economic relief from the COVID-19 pandemic. The measure included $600 stimulus checks for most Americans.Some of the ire was focused on prosperity gospel pastor Joel Osteen, who runs Houston, Texas-based, Lakewood Church, one of the largest evangelical megachurches in the country. Lakewood received $4.4 million in federal coronavirus relief, which prompted some to compare that amount to the $600 stimulus checks.For example, author Marianne Williamson, who ran in the Democratic presidential primaries, tweeted that she was ""very upset"" about millions of dollars in funds given out to wealthy people under the federal government's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was part of the March 2020 coronavirus stimulus package. At that time, most Americans each received a $1,200 check — double the amount approved by Congress in December.It's true that Lakewood received more than $4.4 million in PPP loans, which can be found in an easily searchable database of such loans provided by The Washington Post. Don Iloff, a spokesperson for Lakewood Church, told Houston television station KPRC that Osteen didn't personally benefit from the loan, and that the money from the federal government was used to support 368 church employees while in-person services have been suspended due to the pandemic.On Dec. 22, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that he may torpedo the spending package approved by both chambers of Congress, which includes the $600 stimulus checks, stating that he thought Americans should instead get $2,000 each.The rollout of the PPP loan program has been controversial. An estimated 5.2 million businesses (including Snopes) received loans of various amounts. But some of the disbursals have stoked anger because of the wealth of the people associated with businesses receiving them, while many struggling small businesses that applied for loans were unable to secure them.For example, NFL quarterback Tom Brady's sports performance and nutrition company TB12, for example, received nearly $1 million even as Brady signed a $50 million, two-year contract to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Successful musician Kanye West's shoe brand Yeezy received $2 million."	true
1478	A drone flying between trees captured video of a person being chased by a bear in the snowy wilderness.	"The video was real. The bear, whose name is Tom, was said to have been trained since birth.On Jan. 26, 2022, Reddit user u/namey_mcnameson posted a video that purportedly showed the view of a drone flying between trees in a snowy wilderness to reveal a man being chased by what might have been a grizzly bear. The caption of the video on the r/Unexpected subreddit read: ""Such a lovely day to test out my drone.""Our research for this story took several twists and turns. At one point, we believed that we had uncovered clear evidence that the video had been at least partially faked with visual effects. However, we later received an email and proof that showed the bear in the video was a real, trained animal.The top comment said: ""WE NEED ANSWERS!""Some commenters initially believed that the video might be the work of a CGI artist. ""The snow doesn't flick up very naturally from the footsteps,"" u/wealllovethrowaways said. ""It's very likely CGI, but it's damn good CGI."" Close-up of the bear at 418x480, blown up to 1200 pixels in height. (Courtesy: Reddit)The best available resolution for the video on Reddit appeared to be 418x480, which was quite low. If the video did contain some CGI work, one good strategy to hide that fact might be to lower the quality of the clip to make it more difficult for viewers to study details. The moment the bear looked back. (Courtesy: Reddit)One user believed it to be animation created with the graphics software Blender. Others discussed just how fast bears can run, saying that the person in the video would have been bear food within seconds. ""That bear is a paid actor,"" joked another person.However, some users weren't so sure it was fake. ""I'm under the impression that this is a real video without audio, but the audio was added for comedic effect,"" a commenter said. That comment had more than 200 likes in agreement with believing the video was real. Another person concurred: ""I second this theory."" Speaking of theories, several people also mentioned a one about it maybe being a ""trained bear.""The sound in the clip initially appeared to have been recreated and was not the original audio. The audio from drones can often sound like little more than loud whirring or buzzing from the mechanics that enable it to fly.The one thing that all of the Reddit comments had in common was that no one was initially able to uncover definitive evidence of the origins of the supposed drone video.Hours after it was posted to Reddit, the moderators of r/Unexpected unexpectedly removed the thread with the video. Sometime after that, the video was later tweeted by @TheoShantonas with the caption, ""Lovely day to test out a drone"":From there, it was quote tweeted by various Twitter accounts such as ""The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz,"" who copied in wildlife expert Ron Magill. Magill responded: ""OMG!!! Great video but I find it hard to believe that it wasn't carefully 'produced.' No way that guy could outrun a serious bear in the snow!""We found no further information about the video on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, or the Russian-language social media website VK.com (V Kontakte).It was at that point that we tried an old trick. After downloading the video from Reddit, we used the Adobe product Media Encoder to take a screenshot of the first frame of the video. We then tried a reverse image search on Google Images. Amazingly, it found one result that read, ""Завтрак убегает | Пикабу."" The video had been posted on pikabu.ru just one day before it appeared on Reddit.In the pikabu.ru version of the video, a watermark for TikTok referred to a user named @standartantares. We then visited the TikTok channel for @standartantares and found that the video had been posted on Jan. 24, two days before it showed up on Reddit.In the comments, the person who posted it said that the audio was a ""voiceover."" The video's hashtag #krd may have referred to a Russian YouTube account named KRD FPV that posted another drone video shot in the snow on Jan. 22. No videos on the YouTube channel showed a bear.On the TikTok channel, we found similar drone videos, but only the one with a bear. Two videos appeared to show quite the amazing drone shots of an airplane at sunrise or sunset. Were they real? The hashtags on one of the videos were ""#mavic"" and ""#djv,"" which appeared to refer to the line of DJI Mavic drones and the DJV visual effects review software that's intended ""for VFX, animation, and film production."" Another hashtag in one of the videos said: ""#magic.""In the comments, @standartantares joked that the man was ""still running"": These TikTok comments were translated from Russian to English.At this point, we believed that our work was done and that the hashtag that referenced visual effects meant that there was likely a clever mix of a CGI bear with a background video shot by a drone.Hours after we found the TikTok account, the relevant videos appeared to have been removed. The user, @standartantares, addressed the deletion of the videos, saying in a comment that they would be added back at a later date.On Jan. 29, we received an email from Dima Smirnov, who turned out to be the true creator of the drone video with the man running from the bear. He told us that the @standartantares TikTok channel had stolen his videos.In the comments for his original posting of the bear video, Smirnov told multiple users that it was all real and that the bear was ""like a pet."" He also referenced the man in the video, @black4riday on Instagram, who also said that the bear was real.We responded to Smirnov, asking if he could provide more details and perhaps even some evidence. On Feb. 2, he sent the following video that showed the GoPro source files from the drone. He said that the bear, whose name is Tom, had been trained since birth. The video included the original buzzing sounds on the drone's audio and showed more of the bear, as well as proof that the airplane videos were also real:Smirnov was once interviewed on television about his first-person view (FPV) drone videos, including one that flew over St. Petersburg:In sum, while for several days we believed the drone video of the man running from the bear to be fake, we later received evidence of Smirnov's impressive creative work. It was all real. For these reasons, we have changed the rating to be ""True.""The clip with the drone and the person running from the bear reminded us of another story where we looked at whether or not a TikTok video showed a man saving a dog from train tracks. That video was of higher quality and allowed us to be able to examine small details.With regard to Reddit, we previously debunked a picture that purported to show ""the last photo of the last queen of Mongolia."" We also found a claim to be untrue that said a photograph showed Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein watching former U.S. President Richard Nixon resign. However, another post on Reddit about a man named Capt. Cumming who suggested semen be used as invisible ink during World War I was true.On the subject of bears and videos, we previously were the first to report about the viral video that showed a woman pushing a bear off her fence to save her dogs. We later reported on a video of a bear charging at a man in his own garage. We also covered an incident involving a bear charging at a crowd at a Mammoth Motocross race track. All three happened in California."	true
2637	Guinness World Records recognized Zion Clark, an American entrepreneur and motivational speaker, as the fastest man on two hands in the world.	"Born without legs, Zion Clark is nothing short of inspirational. And in 2021, he joined the Guinness World Records book of fame for being the fast man to run a 20-meter stint on his hands. Clark, 23, was born with caudal regression syndrome, a rare condition characterized by the abnormal development of the lower half of the body where the bones of the spine are often misshapen or missing, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. The condition affects between one to two of every 100,000 newborns in the U.S., and can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. On Feb. 15, 2021, Clark took to his high school gym in Massillon, Ohio, to attempt the beating the record for the fastest 20-meter dash while walking on hands. In what is described as exploding in a “burst of speed,” Clark beat the previous record in his new time of 4.78 seconds, according to a news release published in September. “The message I would give to kids with disabilities or anyone with a disability would be – It’s going to be hard, but if you’ve got the heart and the determination, you can go get what’s yours. If you’re disabled or you’re not disabled, the message stays the same,” said Clark. https://youtu.be/cEItmb_a20M
 
Clark’s record is now written in the pages of Guinness World Records 2022, which he says makes him feel like a “member of an elite group.”"	true
1124	Tucker Carlson emailed Hunter Biden asking for his help in getting his son into Georgetown University, including writing a recommendation letter.	"Since the 2020 elections, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has attacked U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for allegedly engaging in business practices by means of which Hunter allegedly benefited from his father's position. But just a few years ago, according to an internet rumor, Carlson was asking for the younger Biden's help in getting his son into college. A meme going around claims that an email shows Carlson thanking Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown University on behalf of his son, Buckley. This claim is accurate. In 2014, when Joe Biden was serving as vice president, Carlson and his wife, Susie, reached out to Hunter Biden for help in getting their son into Georgetown University. Their email communication was revealed through forensic analysis of a laptop once owned by Biden that he had purportedly left at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019. The laptop was obtained by Trump's then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and its contents pushed out to the New York Post in 2020. The correspondence on Biden's hard drive, a copy of which was also in the possession of the FBI, was largely used to investigate his overseas business dealings during his father's time in the White House, but also have illuminated more about the Carlson-Biden relationship. The emails were given to The Washington Post on a hard drive by activist Jack Maxey, who received it from Giuliani. The Washington Post revealed the details of Carlson's and Biden's communication in May 2022, and was able to confirm with the help of forensic analysis and interviews with people familiar with the communications that this and other emails on the hard drive were real. So what did Carlson actually say? The Post shared an image of a few of the emails in which he thanks Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown ""on Buckley's [his son's] behalf."" He added, ""So nice of you. I know it'll help."" 
Image via Washington PostCarlson's wife wrote to Biden in 2014: ""I realize you don't really know Buckley.

""I will do anything you would like me to do,"" he said.Carlson described his son's interest in squash and fly fishing and wrote, ""He loves Washington for all the right reasons, I think, and really wants to go to school here.""When Biden agreed to write a letter for Buckley, Susie responded with, ""Tucker and I have the greatest respect and admiration for you. Always!""Carlson admitted that he was once close with Biden in a phone interview with the Post. He said: ""Hunter Biden was my neighbor. Our wives were friends. I knew him well. I talked to him many times about addiction, something I know a lot about. And I've said that. I think that Hunter Biden is an addict and that's why his life is falling apart, and I feel bad for him. I've said that many times, and I mean it.""He refused to discuss the emails, however, pointing (with apparent irony) to claims that the timing of the laptop's emergence in 2020 had the hallmarks of Russian disinformation. Previously, Carlson had dismissed and mocked claims of a Russian disinformation campaign as an effort by the establishment and tech giants to protect Joe Biden's 2020 election campaign. It is unclear if Biden ended up writing a letter, but Carlson's son did end up going to the University of Virginia. ""I can't confirm these emails. The emails that you're referring to were described by our intel community as Russian disinformation,"" he said. He added that he could not verify the emails as he did not have access to the account. Hunter Biden declined to comment to the Post.Since 2020, Carlson has regularly skewered the younger Biden on his show, accusing him of getting ""lucrative jobs … because he had an important father.""He did say there were certain lines he would not cross, pertaining to the laptop. In October 2020, he said: ""Much of the material on the laptop is of limited relevance to the public. [...] And by the way, if we're being honest, some of the exchanges between Hunter Biden and his father, and they are on there, too, reveal that whatever you say about them, Joe Biden really loves his son, and they're touching."" "	true
2274	A photograph shows an official poster from the National Health Service warning that the COVID-19 vaccine causes Bell's palsy.	"Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and “advice” you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. 
In January 2022, an image started to circulate on social media that supposedly showed an official poster from England's National Health Service (NHS) warning that the COVID-19 vaccine causes Bell's palsy. This is not a genuine poster from NHS. Furthermore, a link between the COVID-19 vaccine and Bell's palsy has not been proven. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care, which oversees NHS, told us that this was not a ""government sanctioned poster or message"" and that the NHS logo had been used without permission. The spokesperson said:“This is not a government sanctioned poster or message and the NHS logo has been used without knowledge or permission. This kind of misinformation about the vaccine causes harm and costs lives. The evidence is clear – Vaccines are safe, effective and the best defence against Covid. We have mounted a major public information campaign giving people facts and advice about the vaccine at every possible opportunity and specialised government teams work to identify and remove harmful disinformation about the virus.""It's worth noting, too, that the person featured in this poster did not develop Bell's palsy after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. This photograph has been available via stock photo websites since at least 2011. Anti-vaxxers have been pushing the Bell's palsy claim since the COVID-19 vaccines were first introduced. While there have been some cases of people developing Bell's palsy after taking the vaccine, researchers have not found a definitive link between the vaccine and Bell's palsy, a temporary form of facial paralysis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in September 2020:The observed frequency of reported Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population, and there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time.In January 2022, The Lancet published a paper that examined various studies into the relationship between COVID-19 vaccines and Bell's palsy. That paper concluded there was not definitive evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines were linked to an increase in Bell's palsy, and while research was still being done, one certainty remained: ""The benefit of getting vaccinated outweighs any possible risk."""	false
3279	A video taken in October 2020 off of Coney Island showed a bizarre “sea creature” caught by a fisherman.	"A shark expert told Snopes that despite its otherworldly appearance, the “sea creature” was likely a little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) tangled up in a fishing line.A widely circulated video taken in October 2020 off of the coast of Coney Island showed what appeared to be a bizarrely shaped “sea creature” that looked to be out of this world.Backed with the main theme music of Netflix’s sci-fi series Stranger Things, the video was posted by TikTok user Nataliia Vorobok on Oct. 7, 2020, and went viral in January 2021 after British pop-news site Unilad published an article likening the creature to the ""Demogorgon"" featured in the Netflix series. Despite its otherworldly appearance, shark expert David Ebert told Snopes that the “sea creature” was likely a little skate, Leucoraja erinacea. And as for those large wand-like appendages, Ebert said that those are claspers that indicate the animal is a male. “This is a skate, an adult male — you can tell from the claspers — but it looks like it is tangled up in monofilament fishing line, which is giving it a contorted appearance,” said Ebert.Any explanation that the animal was “underdeveloped” or experienced malformations due to poison is not plausible, according to Ebert. A closer look at the video revealed that the ray’s wings wrapped in fishing line, furling them around the animal’s body.Little skates are related to other cartilaginous fishes in the family Rajixae and are found in shallow oceanic waters along the North American east coast, from Nova Scotia, Canada to North Carolina. With a blunt nose and diamond-shaped disc of a body, little skates can grow up to about 20 inches long and have thorny spins on their shoulders, tails and backs that can prick a person if they are stepped on or picked up, according to the Florida Museum at the University of Florida.And interestingly enough, the little skates are known to “walk” along the seafloor with tiny legs — a trait that may help explain how terrestrial animals evolved from swimming in the sea to walking on the land."	true
162	"In July 2023, AMC Theaters served nanobots to ""Sound of Freedom"" film audiences."	"On July 12, 2023, a tweet went viral from a person who claimed to be a former AMC Theaters employee and who reported being fired for refusing to add a liquid that contained nanobots to the soda of a customer who was seeing ""Sound of Freedom."" The claim spread as AMC Theaters' CEO ""slammed"" conspiracy theories about the company purposefully disrupting screenings of the film, after the movie was accused of stirring QAnon conspiracy theories. ""I work at AMC and just got fired for refusing to add this liquid to a customer's soda,"" the tweet said. ""We were instructed specifically to serve this to Sound of Freedom audiences. I am a microbiology student and took it to the lab to examine and found what looks like nanobots inside."" (In 2019, NBC described nanobots as robots that were only a few hundred nanometers wide, with 25 million nanometers composing an inch.)

4074	A photograph shows a dog that suffered burns on its face after escaping a house fire.	"In 2015, a humorous photograph of a dog with a slice of ham on its face was circulated on social media, along with the false claim that the animal that had suffered burns while rescuing a family from a house fire. In 2020, we came across a similar photograph attached to a similar story. This time, however, the picture was real.The above-displayed photograph was taken circa the summer of 2019 and shows a dog named Taka, a Shiba Inu who survived a house fire in Georgia the previous fall. The American Kennel Club (AKC) reported that when the fire broke out, the family was able to get their children out of the house but not 9-year-old Taka. As the fire burned, Taka managed to escape on his own:On Oct. 23, 2018, a fire broke out in Georgia. The family had time to get their kids out, but there was no time to go back in for Taka, their nine-year-old Shiba Inu. The fire burned the entire porch, causing the floor to collapse and Taka to fall through. Taka was able to run to a neighbor’s house. Upon seeing a dog on fire, the neighbors panicked and reached out to Crystal Lesley, a veterinarian at Care More Animal Hospital on Facebook.“When I saw the picture I immediately called her and told her she needed to bring him to me!” Lesley says. “She was able to get some help and they brought him in. He was still smoking when they found him. We had never encountered a burn victim as severe as Taka before and we were terrified that he wouldn’t make it.”The road to recovery was reportedly long and painful. Since the Care More Animal Hospital was not equipped to aid the dog, veterinarian Lesley took Taka to a specialist in South Carolina. Taka needed some serious medical attention — the burns the dog suffered prevented him from blinking and required skin grafts on his face — so the family decided to sign the dog over to the vet's care.Lesley, who saw the dog through months of treatment, would eventually give Taka a new, permanent home. Then, she started to train him as a therapy dog to help burn victims:AKC reported:In order to work in the burn unit, Taka would need his Therapy Dog certification. This is what started Lesley on a journey of training Taka. She started working with trainer Mandy Foster, and Taka immediately loved it and was proud of himself.The first step to therapy dog training is the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. The most difficult part of CGC training was teaching Taka to stay. “He took a little while to do that out in public,” Lesley says. “But honestly, he has flown right through it. He is so smart!”While the picture at the top of this article says ""Taka is now training"" to become a therapy dog for burn victims, this statement is out of date. According to the AKC, Taka obtained his therapy dog certification in July 2019:Taka took the CGC test on July 26 and passed. Lesley was beyond happy. “I am so incredibly proud of him,” she says. “Just thinking back to how far he has come and where he is now, is just so emotional. The amount of love and respect I have for him is profound.”Here's a report about Taka's journey from television station WJBF:"	true
6345	Photographs show snow in the Sahara Desert in January 2018.	"In January 2018, snow fell in a high-altitude region of the Sahara Desert located in northern Algeria. The area has experienced snowfall in the past, and these events often generate significant media coverage due to the seemingly counterintuitive nature of snow falling in a desert (despite the fact that deserts refer to lack of precipitation rather than average temperatures). That media coverage often comes with the claim that it is the first time snow has touched desert sand in decades — despite the fact that such occurrences take place fairly regularly.Just over a year ago, we investigated similar photographs of snow from the same town, Aïn Séfra. Those photographs, as well as these (captured by local photographers) are real and have been corroborated by Algerian news reports. Sekkouri Kamel, who lives in Aïn Séfra, posted a series of photographs to his Facebook account, some of which were subsequently shared by National Geographic.Here are some of Kamel's images: Hamouda Ben Jerad, a professional photographer who also lives in Aïn Séfra, shared images of the desert snow on his Facebook page, including one showing a number of local people sliding down a snow-covered sand dune. Snow has fallen in Aïn Séfra — which, while normally dry, regularly experiences conditions approaching freezing — on at least four occasions in the past six years. On 21 January 2017, flurries from dawn until late afternoon left most of the area blanketed in snow, as reported by French news site France Info. A month before that, there was a brief flurry of snow lasting only a couple of hours, also according to France Info. This event was widely (but falsely) reported as the Sahara Desert's first snow in almost 40 years. In fact, snow was documented over the desert in the Bechar region near Aïn Séfra in January 2012 by Algerian TV channel Central TV, which described it as ""an exceptional natural phenomenon in this Saharan region."" "	true
4047	Kamala Harris' press secretary was hired by Twitter to moderate U.S. President Donald Trump's tweets.	In early August 2020, Snopes readers inquired about social media posts and articles that stated Twitter had hired the press secretary for U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, to moderate tweets posted by U.S. President Donald Trump. Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, tapped Harris as his vice-presidential running mate in August 2020.The media pile-on was initiated on Aug. 5, 2020, after Twitter's Nick Pacilio stated in a tweet that a post from Trump's reelection campaign account, retweeted by Trump, had been removed for violating the platform's rules against spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic:But the tweet above, posted by the co-founder of The Federalist website, is misleading.First, Pacilio isn't currently Harris' press secretary — he served in that role from 2011 to 2014, while Harris was the attorney general of California. Second, he doesn't enforce Twitter rules in his role at the company.Although the tweet above, and other content like it, insinuated that Pacilio was hired recently (late summer of 2020) by Twitter, Pacilio's employment there actually started in 2014. Furthermore, in Pacilio's position with Twitter's communications department, he has no role in platform rules.That latter point was made pointedly in a tweet by Brandon Borrman, Twitter's head of communications:	false
1907	Service station customers are getting stuck by HIV-loaded syringes affixed to gas pump handles.	"A hoax urging service station customers to exercise caution when pumping gas appeared first on the Internet in early June 2000:[Collected via e-mail, 2000]My name is Captain Abraham Sands of the Jacksonville, Florida Police Department. I have been asked by state and local authorities to write this email in order to get the word out to car drivers of a very dangerous prank that is occurring in numerous states.Some person or persons have been affixing hypodermic needles to the underside of gas pump handles. These needles appear to be infected with HIV positive blood. In the Jacksonville area alone there have been 17 cases of people being stuck by these needles over the past five months. We have verified reports of at least 12 others in various states around the country.It is believed that these may be copycat incidents due to someone reading about the crimes or seeing them reported on the television. At this point no one has been arrested and catching the perpetrator(s) has become our top priority.Shockingly, of the 17 people who where stuck, eight have tested HIV positive and because of the nature of the disease, the others could test positive in a couple years.Evidently the consumers go to fill their car with gas, and when picking up the pump handle get stuck with the infected needle. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CAREFULLY CHECK THE HANDLE of the gas pump each time you use one. LOOK AT EVERY SURFACE YOUR HAND MAY TOUCH, INCLUDING UNDER THE HANDLE.If you do find a needle affixed to one, immediately contact your local police department so they can collect the evidence.PLEASE HELP US BY MAINTAINING A VIGILANCE AND BY FORWARDING THIS EMAIL TO ANYONE YOU KNOW WHO DRIVES. THE MORE PEOPLE WHO KNOW OF THIS THE BETTER PROTECTED WE CAN ALL BE.
 [Collected via e-mail, 2006]East Coast - Warning!
In Florida and other places on the East Coast a group of people are putting HIV/AIDS infected and filled needles underneath gas pump handles, so when someone reaches to pick it up and put gas in their car, they get stabbed with it. 16 people have been a victim of this crime so far and 10 tested HIV positive. Instead of posting that stupid crap about how your love life will suck for years to come of you don't re-post, post this. It's important to inform people, even if you don't drive, a family member might, and what if they were next? CHECK UNDER THE HANDLE BEFORE YOU GRAB IT!!! IT MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE! Tell as many people as you can about this serious issue!

It's important to inform people, even if you don't drive, a family member might, and what if they were next? CHECK UNDER THE HANDLE)In common with other AIDS-infected needle scares (e.g., syringe attacks in movies houses and dance clubs and contaminated needles in payphone coin returns), this rumor plays upon our fear of contracting a dread disease through the pursuit of ordinary and harmless activities.There is no Abraham Sands with the Jacksonville Police Department: someone just invented a name to make this ""warning"" look authoritative. No newspaper stories from that city made any mention of Sands, which is unusual (to say the least) about a department's spokesperson; Jacksonville is served by a sheriff's office, not a police department; a phone call to the Jacksonville Sheriff produced the response that they'd never heard of Abraham Sands; and he wasn't listed with the rest of the personnel on the City of Jacksonville Sheriff's Office web site. No news stories out of Florida confirmed the e-mail's claim that 17 people had been injured by these attacks, the City of Jacksonsville Sheriff's Office said the whole thing was a hoax, and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta stated they were not aware of any cases where HIV had been transmitted by a needle-stick injury outside of a health care setting:Besieged with phone calls and electronic mail, officials in Jacksonville are trying to quell an e-mail hoax that claims hypodermic needles concealed in gas pumps are responsible for spreading the virus that causes AIDS.The Sheriff's Office has received more than 1,000 phone calls and e-mails from people around the country trying to confirm the information.The e-mail, titled ""A dangerous prank going around,"" is purported to be from a ""Capt. Abraham Sands"" with the ""Jacksonville Police Department.""The Sheriff's Office has never had a Capt. Abraham Sands and has no idea where the message originated. Also, there have been no reports of needles hidden in gas pumps, said John Turner, spokesman for the Sheriff's Office. And the Jacksonville Police Department ceased to exist in 1968 when it was merged with the Sheriff's Office as part of consolidation.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have no reported cases of AIDS from needle-stick injury to anyone outside the health care field.People are also calling the Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund, whose small staff answered about 200 phone calls on Tuesday alone. Because police is part of the fund's name, people from as far away as California are calling, assuming it is part of the police department in Jacksonville.The Sheriff's Office intelligence unit also has looked into the Internet message to see if anything could be done to stop the rumor. The message is a nuisance but not illegal, Turner said.""We live in a world now where crazy things happen and people want some assurance,"" said spokesman Harry Reagan.Although there have been a few isolated reports of copycat pranksters leaving needles in public places (including gas pumps, such as an incident in May 2017) in the wake of this hoax, none of those incidents has involved a needle bearing any traces of HIV. No matter how it is reworded, the ""Captain Abraham Sands"" message is naught but anotherhoax dreamed up by someone intent upon enjoying the sight of people thrown into a panic over nothing.<!--

2101	"A video of a long snake ""standing up"" and raising its head high into the air is real."	"We shared the video with John Kleopfer, a state herpetologist with the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources. By email, he confirmed that the snake shown in the clip was, in fact, a king cobra.In early August 2022, a video was shared on social media with captions that claimed it showed a ""snake standing up"" and ""raising its head."" Readers appeared to want to know not only if the video was real, but also sought more information about whether it showed a king cobra, black mamba, or other kind of snake.In our initial searches, the oldest version of the ""snake standing up"" video that we located was from a Facebook page named We are Malaysians. It was posted on Aug. 1 with the caption, ""King Cobra"":According to the video's view count, it had been played on the We are Malaysians Facebook page nearly 5 million times in less than two weeks.A reader shared with us another post that featured a slightly longer version of the same video. This lengthier version of the clip was posted on the Zimbabwe-based Sly Media Productions Facebook page on Aug. 11. This indicated that the We are Malaysians posting of the video likely wasn't the first time it was shared.Users in several posts on Reddit debated whether the video showed a king cobra or black mamba raising its head. Both of these types of snakes can raise the front portion of their bodies. The Reddit posts were also filled with lots of jokes about the snake in the video. For example, one user joked, ""That’s me when I’m looking for my wife at Target because I wanted to look at the electronics really quick.""According to the Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute, the venomous king cobra's ""average size is 10 to 12 feet (3 to 3.6 meters), but it can reach 18 feet (5.4 meters).""

1236	A video shows KPRC-TV traffic reporter Anavid Reyes having a meltdown on live TV.	"The video was created by a stand-up comedian named John Crist. At the same time, Anavid Reyes was the name of a woman who worked for KPRC-TV. As of 2022, she was still working as a traffic reporter.On Oct. 31, 2022, a TikTok user reposted an old video. The clip appeared to show a male traffic reporter for KPRC-TV named Anavid Reyes having a tough morning. ""Traffic Reporter Has Meltdown on Air,"" the video's caption read. However, the truth was that this was the work of a stand-up comedian named John Crist. It was not a real traffic report that aired on TV.Crist originally posted the funny video on his Facebook page on Feb. 1, 2021. As of November 2022, that post had racked up more than 8.5 million views. By comparison, the more recent TikTok repost had already received nearly 3 million views in less than 24 hours.In the comedic video, Crist, portraying the character of Reyes, becomes angry at the studio anchor's pronunciation of his first name, Anavid. ""If I'm going to come out here and do these live traffic reports and literally risk my life, I'd appreciate it if somebody back at the studio could learn how to pronounce my name,"" he says. He then pokes fun at how traffic reports on local TV news had purportedly become ""obsolete"" due to the availability of apps like Google Maps.While the video was not from a real news broadcast, it might come as a surprise to some readers that KPRC-TV did employ a traffic reporter by the name of Anavid Reyes. However, unlike Crist, the real Reyes is a woman, not a man.On Nov. 12, 2021, Click2Houston.com, the website for KPRC-TV, highlighted a special accomplishment made by Reyes, just after she had been crowned as the 2022 METRO Traffic Reporter Bus Rodeo champion.""The METRO event organizers invited Houston-area traffic reporters to get behind the wheel and see if they have what it takes to wrangle a 40-foot METRO bus through one of the toughest safety courses in Texas,"" the story read. ""Anavid got a perfect score and was the only traffic reporter who did not hit a cone.""On Crist's YouTube channel, we didn't find the ""Traffic Reports Has Meltdown on Air"" video. However, our search did show a result for another, similar video made by Crist in which he portrayed a weatherman named Ryan Marshall. Its title was, ""Weather Man MELTS down on live TV."""	false

"An image supposedly showing a poorly designed anti-drug / pro-pizza sign is frequently circulated on the internet with mocking comments. The sign features two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Rafael and Donatello, and a slogan that appears to read: ""Say Pizza to Drugs, Say No to Yes.""The wording on this sign has been digitally altered. The original image featured the slogan ""Say no to drugs, say yes to pizza,"" although its rendering was still a bit confusing. The original photograph dates back to 2014, when it was shared to Scavengedluxury, a Tumblr page that frequently featured street photography from around Nottingham, England. Here's a look at the altered image (left) and the genuine photograph (right):While the intended message on this poster was clearly, ""Say No to Drugs, Say Yes to Pizza,"" the barrier in the middle of the poster leads some people to read it as, ""Say No Say Yes, To Drugs to Pizza."" This led to some shares on comedy sites such as 9gag, and eventually, the image was photoshopped to have an even less clear message. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have a long history of peddling pizzas. TMNT video games and movies have featured product placement for Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut. The Turtles have also starred in a number of Pizza Hut commercials and advertising campaigns. The Turtles have also been part of anti-drug campaigns. "	false
3949	"Dean Browning, a white man who previously ran and lost in the 2020 Republican primary for U.S. House Pennsylvania District 7, tweeted, ""I'm a black gay guy"" from his verified Twitter account."	"A tweet from former Lehigh County Commissioner Dean Browning led a handful of Twitter users to do a double-take. Earlier in 2020, Browning lost the Republican primary race for U.S. House Pennsylvania District 7. He described himself in his Twitter bio as: ""A proud pro-life & pro-2A Christian conservative dedicated to enacting common sense solutions to Keep America Great.""On Nov. 10, 2020, someone -- presumably Browning -- controlling his verified Twitter account tweeted: ""I'm a black gay guy and I can personally say that Obama did nothing for me, my life only changed a little bit and it was for the worse. Everything is so much better under Trump though. I feel respected - which I never do when democrats are involved.""The tweet came in response to another Twitter user who responded to one of Browning's pinned tweets. Twitter users speculated that the ""black gay guy"" tweet was apparently to be meant to be issued from an alternate account controlled by Browning under the pretense of being a gay black man who supports U.S. President Donald Trump.Around five hours after the tweet was posted, a user noticed it, and it began to spread virally, picking up thousands of retweets and likes. Browning then deleted the tweet. Soon after deleting it, he tweeted that he was quoting a message he received earlier from another follower.The story of the ""black gay guy"" tweet did not end there, however.An account named @DanPurdy322 is believed by Twitter users to be an alternate account maintained by Browning, meaning the ""black gay guy"" tweet may have been meant to be posted under the @DanPurdy322 persona. After Browning deleted that tweet, @DanPurdy322 tweeted two videos, with @DanPurdy322 claiming to have sent Browning the message that Browning tweeted.We found other instances of @DanPurdy322 responding to someone who replied to Browning.Some Twitter users were quick to note that @DanPurdy322 bore a strong resemblance to William Holte, purported to be singer Patti LaBelle's son. Holte's Facebook account, named facebook.com/william.m.holte in the URL, but Byl Holte by name, contained the same cartoonish profile image from Twitter. @DanPurdy322 also tweeted that ""common sense is the solution,"" which bore a striking similarity to the name of a website listed in Browning's Twitter bio: Common Sense Solutions.In the past, Browning has tweeted about the ""weapon of war"" capabilities of Twitter:Browning's past tweets also included the idea of a ""muzzled"" U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, which included a monkey emoji. Browning also tweeted that Omar's face needed to be ""put on a wanted poster"" to hang in post offices.He also tweeted that Joe Biden turned his son Hunter into a ""crackhead,"" questioned the COVID-19 death toll, said that ""so many other crimes are more deserving of the national eye than Breonna Taylor,"" spread mail-in voting conspiracy theories ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and called MSNBC host Joy Reid ""stupid,"" ""racist,"" and a ""cow.""Other tweets from Browning's verified Twitter account included the following, one of which appeared to push the QAnon conspiracy theory:In August, the Republican-led U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee issued its fifth and final report on Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, detailing the extent to which Trump campaign officials had involvement in the matter. The report detailed fake American personas that were used by Russia to influence real Americans on social media.

228	"At a campaign stop in Texas, an audience member called Ron DeSantis ""just another establishment little bitch."""	"On June 28, 2023, a TikTok user posted a video appearing to show Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also a candidate for the U.S. presidency, being heckled and handling it poorly.

Desantis may just drop out now ! #DeSantisIsADangerToTheUSA pic.twitter.com/wj1Ha3rQPm— TRUMP FOR JAIL 🌊🌊💙💙💙 (@azardey3) June 28, 2023The viral video allegedly includes this exchange between DeSantis and an audience member:WOMAN: Just came here to let you know that you'll never be our president. You're just another establishment little bitch. Thank you. DESANTIS: Well, okay, let's not, let's just, some people are actually here to see me. You know, some people actually like me, for instance. Uh, show of hands, everybody, uh, how many of you are actually gonna vote for me? [Audience member raises hand]DESANTIS:  One guy. Okay. I guess they… this is just really awkward. While the video is real, this audio is either AI-generated or fabricated in some other way.

In reality, the exchange — which begins at 51:30 in the full Rumble video — concerned fentanyl deaths in America. The actual transcript of that interaction looks like this:WOMAN: Thank you Governor. Um, my name is Veronica [...]. My daughter passed away from Fentanyl poisoning. Um, this isn't really a question, but more of a… Sometimes fentanyl overdoses are not overdoses. They're poisonings. So can we start calling them what they are: a poisoning and it's a murder. DESANTIS: Absolutely. And we're sorry to hear about your daughter.

6381	The United States government has secretly negotiated a deal to return the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico to Spain.	"In December 2017, word spread quickly via social media that the United States intends to return the territory of Puerto Rico to Spain after a report detailing such a plan was published in the Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Día.The report said the plan was the result of secret negotiations between the United States and Spain (translation ours):A hundred and nineteen years after the Treaty of Paris, which enabled the transfer of ownership of Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States, Madrid and Washington have virtually finalized an agreement to return the jurisdiction of the Caribbean island to the European country, endi.com sources have confirmed. The deal, which has been negotiated in secret for at least two years, is not yet official, but it has the approval of Presidents Donald Trump of the United States and Mariano Rajoy of Spain and certain technical details are all that remain to finalize. An announcement was expected before the end of the year, but it is possible that the emergence of last-minute complications will delay approval of the transfer until the first days of 2018. The agreement has to be approved by the US Congress, which was occupied until the last hours of his last session by federal tax reform and did not have time to address this issue.It was reported that the agreement has overwhelming support in Congress. ""This has long been done. Moreover, the United States should never have taken possession of Puerto Rico. It was a mistake. Puerto Rico has cost us too much, "" said Alabama Republican Sen. Luke McCullen.Whatever surface plausibility the article may have had stemmed from strained relations between the United States and Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The territory was devastated by the storm, which left millions without power and basic necessities for months. The Trump administration was criticized by many inside and outside Puerto Rico for what was termed an inadequate, too-slow response to the crisis. President Trump said the government's response compared favorably to that in past hurricanes and told Puerto Ricans the effort had thrown the federal budget ""out of whack.""Although El Nuevo Día is a reputable daily newspaper, a number of clues point to the information being false. For one, no such plan has been reported by any mainstream news outlets anywhere in the world but El Nuevo Día. For another, the agreement has not come up for public debate or voting in Congress, despite the claim that it ""enjoys overwhelming support"" there. Additionally, there is no U.S. Senator from Alabama (or any other state) named Luke McCullen. (The article also names a fictional U.S. Ambassador to Spain, ""Cletus Ryder."" The actual ambassador, confirmed by the Senate in November 2017, is Duke Buchan.)A disclaimer at the bottom of the article revealed that the story is, in fact, a prank:Nota del editor: esta historia no es verídica. ¡Feliz Día de los Santos Inocentes![Tr: ""Editor's note: This story isn't true. Happy Day of the Holy Innocents!""]"	false

In late December 2021, various anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists and websites spread a false claim online that ""Over 95% of"" the COVID-19 variant ""Omicron Cases are in Vaccinated People.""Here is one example, which was posted to Twitter:The post above was published on Twitter on Dec. 30, 2021, by the conspiratorial network Disclose TV. It reads:""JUST IN - Robert Koch Institute report released today states that 95.58% of the #Omicron cases in Germany are fully vaccinated (28% of those had a ""booster""), 4.42% are unvaccinated.""In other examples, English-language websites and social media personalities made social media posts that left out the disclosure that the figure was from a German source and pertained to Germans, giving the impression that more than 95% of those with the omicron variant were vaccinated Americans.""REPORT: Over 95% of Omicron Cases are in Vaccinated People,"" one post read, for example.The original source of the ""95.58%"" figure, as Disclose TV pointed out in another post, was German journalist Tim Röhn, who was himself sourcing a weekly report provided by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), a German government agency responsible for disease control and prevention.The ""95.58%"" figure was calculated by Röhn, not RKI, in the following tweet:But as Röhn noted, the calculation was the result of an error made by RKI that was later corrected.""Update: The RKI made a significant change in the weekly report 4 days after publication,"" the above tweet states, translated into English. ""Now there are 1097 instead of 186 unvaccinated people, so the proportion of those who have been vaccinated is significantly lower.""

6376	Queen Elizabeth is so upset at public comments made by royal bride-to-be Meghan Markle that she has suspended or threatened to suspend Prince Harry's wedding.	"With the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle scheduled to take place on 19 May 2018, the British tabloids have kicked into overdrive with gossip and speculation about behind-the-scenes drama in Britain's royal family.Anonymous sources were cited toward the end of December 2017 in reports that Markle was asked to sign a prenuptial agreement, sparking a ""first fight"" between the bride-to-be and Prince Harry. On the internet this unsubstantiated rumor devolved into the full-fledged claim that Queen Elizabeth has ""suspended"" the wedding until the prenuptial is signed. According to a 27 December article on the unreliable web site YourNewsWire, some of Markle's controversial public statements were also a factor in the alleged suspension:Queen Elizabeth Suspends Wedding After Meghan Markle Calls Herself ‘Liberal Activist’Meghan Markle’s “game-playing and histrionics” over the Christmas weekend left such a bad taste in Queen Elizabeth’s mouth that she has forced the future princess to sign a prenuptial agreement with Prince Harry — or else the wedding is off.The problem with Meghan Markle is that she still insists on calling herself an “activist” on her Twitter page, and she is a noted hater of the President of the United States. That could be overlooked if she would “stop spreading divisive ideology” on her Twitter page and instead “keep a dignified silence on political matters“, but her “unsuitable” behavior over the Christmas weekend has left Buckingham Palace “concerned.”We've found no real-world evidence that any of the above is the case, however.Although it's true that Markle, an American actress best known for her ongoing role in the television series Suits, describes herself as an ""activist"" on her Twitter profile and has been known to take political stands, particularly on women's issues, she has not tweeted at all since March 2017. And although it's true that Markle labeled then-presidential candidate Donald Trump ""divisive"" and ""misogynistic"" during a May 2016 television interview, she has made no recent public statements interpretable as ""spreading divisive ideology.""One sign that Markle has already been accepted by the royal family was her invitation to the 2017 Christmas festivities at the queen's country estate in Norfolk. According to the British press, it was the first time someone who has yet to marry into the family was invited to attend such an occasion.The queen's formal consent is required before Prince Harry can marry (under the current rules of royal succession), but according to historian Retha Warnicke, an expert on British royal families of the past, the odds are virtually nil that she would withhold such permission.It also appears unlikely that a prenuptial agreement will be demanded or signed before the wedding can take place. A British family law attorney consulted by US Weekly cited the precedent set by both Prince William (Harry's brother) and Prince Charles (his father), neither of whom entered into a prenuptial agreement before they were wed."	false
4216	In June 2020, Weis Markets banned its employees from wearing any representation of the American flag because it was considered controversial amidst the political climate. They also banned the flag from being displayed on merchandise.	As the United States approached a fraught 2020 election season amid a national reckoning over racism and police brutality, the use and meaning of the American flag also became a subject of debate. Rumors about the destruction and banning of the American flag in different contexts spread online, creating a deeper divide between the right and left. One such rumor surfaced in June 2020, claiming that food retailer Weis Markets banned its employees from displaying the American flag anywhere on their person, and even on merchandise.Snopes readers asked us to look into these rumors, and Weis Markets told us that the claims were categorically untrue.Some Facebook users implied that the alleged ban was connected to protests over the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis. They said the display of political logos, slogans, and symbols on clothing — including employees' protective face masks worn during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic — was even a fireable offense.Another post alleged that displaying the flag was deemed controversial:The rumors appeared to have stemmed from normal regulations requiring that all Weis Markets store employees adhere to their uniform, which is currently a red shirt and black trousers. The company has had such policies for at least 50 years.Weis Markets spokesperson Dennis Curtin told Snopes:We have a uniform policy for our associates which has not changed. Our associates cannot wear logoed, messaged or symbolic items while working. This policy extends to face coverings, which have become part of our uniform due to our COVID-19 safety protocols.Rumors that the ban on the American flag extended to merchandise were also untrue. Curtin said:Weis Markets is an American-owned company that has American flags on its trucks and flags at its stores where permitted by local municipalities and leases. We also proudly support veteran groups such as the Paralyzed Veterans of America, to which we donated $175,000 in 2019. Again, we are simply following our existing dress code policy which reflects a respectful work and shopping environment.	false
1796	A few Democratic lawmakers were spotted checking their phones during President Trump's State of the Union address.	"An image purportedly showing Democratic lawmakers checking their phones during President Donald Trump's State of the Union address was posted by Breitbart's White House correspondent Charlie Spiering on 30 January 2018 along with the claim that the image occurred during a portion of the speech about caring for veterans. This tweet was then turned into a meme and subsequently posted to Facebook pages such as USA Patriots for Donald Trump:The claim that it occurred during a portion of the speech about caring for veterans is also mostly true. One could quibble with this assertion and argue that this image was actually broadcast after President Trump mentioned a variety of groups and topics (including Americans, senators, Supreme Court Justices, the 2nd Amendment, and veterans) and just before he mentioned a piece of legislation aimed at caring for veterans. Here's a transcript of this portion of the speech. The bolded ""screenshot"" signifies when the image appeared on screen:Americans love their country. And they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government.Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court justice and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.We are totally defending our Second Amendment and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their health care decisions.[Screenshot]Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark V.A. Accountability Act. Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 V.A. employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve, and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. It's also true that the pictured lawmakers were Democrats. ABC News labeled this section of the audience as ""Democratic Members of Congress"" in the caption of a photograph, and we believe we have identified the two women at the center of the photograph as Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-California) and Rep. Madeleine Bordallo (D-Guam). Here is video of the moment:
The image of these Democratic lawmakers using a phone during the State of the Union is real. This behavior, however, is not unprecedented. Cellphones are nearly ubiquitous and lawmakers may have used these devices to jot down notes, fact check portions of the speech, or monitor social media to see which portions of the speech were striking a chord with their constituents.A spokesperson for Lofgren told us via e-mail that the California representative was sharing a news article with her colleague and that the ""controversy"" over her use of a phone during the State of the Union equated to ""faux outrage"":Lofgren was sharing a news article with her colleague, but perhaps this faux outrage would be better directed towards the man who routinely disrespects and attacks grieving gold star families and ridicules U.S. servicemen taken prisoners of war.We also found a handful of other people using phones during President Trump's speech. Democrats certainly weren't as enthused as their Republican counterparts during Trump's first State of the Union, but the ""disrespectful"" act of using a cellphone appears to have occurred on both sides of the aisle. We have not been able to identify the politicians using their phones in the following image, but this section of the crowd was labeled ""Republican"" by the Washington Post. Well-known Republicans such as Peter King can also be seen in close proximity to the two men on their phones:Similarly, some Democratic lawmakers were spotted on their phones during another portion of the speech:We also examined video of President Barack Obama's final State of the Union address. Again, we found several examples of politicians using their phones (and even a tablet) during the speech."	true
5677	"A photograph shows a woman named ""Brittany L"" on a hunting expedition, holding a recently-killed leopard."	"In September 2018, a photograph went viral on social media along with a caption which claimed it showed a woman named ""Brittany L."" holding a leopard she had just killed during a hunting expedition.On 10 September, the wildlife artist Sue Dickinson posted the photograph to her Facebook page along with a message which read as follows:
This is Brittany L. She just killed this male leopard in his prime. According to SCI (Safari Club International) this leopard ranks as potentially the 9th largest leopard ever hunted. She's a cretin. Please share if you agree. Let's name and shame her.Dickinson's post was shared hundreds of thousands of times within a week and was re-published through multiple accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, including the supermodel Naomi Campbell.The image is authentic and captures a woman posing with a real leopard that she herself killed.The photograph was first posted on 7 September 2018 to the web site of Safari Club International, a hunting organization based in Tucson, Arizona, as part of a group of new entries into the organization's online record book:
SCI members share their hunter prideSCI Members hunt all over the globe, and are proud to share their successes. By entering their successful hunts in the SCI Record Book, they are not only documenting their hunting legacy for future generations, they are also adding to one of the largest and most comprehensive wildlife databases in the world.
The URL of the controversial photograph contains the words ""Brittany L"" and ""leopard,"" so it was reasonable for internet users to deduce that the woman shown with the leopard had the first name Brittany and a surname beginning with the letter ""L."" Indeed, we can confirm that Brittany L. is the woman shown in the photograph (rather than the name of the person who submitted it to SCI's record book).On 7 September, SCI posted more details about ""Brittany L.'s"" leopard photograph on HuntForever.org, a website affiliated with the organization. That blog post has since been removed, but we obtained an SCI newsletter email dated 7 September with content identical to the blog post's embedded in it (despite the post's having been removed from HuntForever.org itself)."	true

Nathan Deal placed Georgia under a state of emergency in a 12 September 2018 order, no agency  reported that the state was ""at capacity.""

1887	A new product allows people to perform laser surgery on their own eyes at home.	"In 2006, an hoax web site wended its way through the Internet and into our e-mail that appeared to be an advertisement for a ""new"" breakthrough in at-home laser eye surgery:The key to the LASIK@Home system is the Scal-Pal™ Scanning Adjusting Laparascopic Personal Laser. This hand-operated combination femtosecond/excimer laser is made exclusively for LASIK@Home by Walton Group Manufacturing, the same company that makes the the LASIK equipment used by more clinics nationwide.The Scal-Pal™ is actually two lasers in one! First the Scal-Pal™ femtosecond laser cuts a small flap in the cornea of your eye. Then the excimer laser vaporizes a tiny section of the lens without damaging the surrounding tissue. The whole procedure takes only a few minutes and is virtually painless.*[...]*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA.LASIK (Laser in Situ Keratomileusis) surgery is a technique for correcting certain types of refractive problems with the eye (e.g., myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism) through the precise and controlled removal of corneal tissue by a special laser that reshapes the cornea. In the United States, only ophthalmologists (i.e., physicians who specialize in the medical and surgical care of the eyes) are allowed to perform LASIK surgery, and all such procedures must use lasers that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Any vendor, therefore, offering LASIK devices for patients to use on themselves to perform at-home eye surgery would be both dangerous and acting illegally. Fortunately, the LASIK@Home web site referenced above is merely a hoax, not a serious attempt to market such devices. (Among the many clues to the site's invalidity are a lack of a phone number, a physical or mailing address, and a functioning mechanism for ordering the product supposedly being advertised).For reasons that remain inexplicable, the hoax web site made a brief resurgence in 2017, eleven years after its first publication. However, as sincere as the image of ""Dr. Amir Khadim, M.D., Ph.D"" might appear, this web site remains a hoax, and despite the tremendous strides that have been made in in technology and medicine since 2006, home eye surgery without training or oversight remains just as dangerous as it ever was."	false

2985	First lady Jill Biden said she did not agree to marry U.S. President Joe Biden until his fifth proposal.	"First lady Jill Biden and U.S. President Joe Biden have been together for more than four decades, but reports across the internet claimed it took up to five proposal attempts before Jill Biden agreed to marry the then-senator from Delaware. And those reports appear to be true.According to an excerpt from Jill Biden’s book, “Where the Light Enters: Building a Family, Discovering Myself,” published in Time magazine, Biden describes the moments that led to her finally agreeing to marry the future president.In the excerpt titled, ""Why Joe Had to Propose 5 Times Before I Said Yes—And What Finally Changed My Mind,"" she describes how she rejected his proposal four times before finally agreeing after his fifth attempt. Why was she so hesitant? She wrote:I was launching my career and planning for graduate school — and then I had staff calling to schedule dates with my boyfriend around his insane Senate schedule. I was being pulled in so many directions. I knew that if I married Joe, I’d have to give up my apartment, the only space that was just for me. I’d have to quit my job for the boys’ sake, to give them the time to acclimate to having someone new in the house every day and not just on weekends. And I’d have to become Jill Biden, senator’s wife. It was all too much.Joe Biden proposed again and again over two years of dating. Before the fifth try, Jill Biden said he finally set an ultimatum before leaving for a trip to South Africa in 1977:“Look,” he said. “I’ve been as patient as I know how to be, but this has got my Irish up. Either you decide to marry me, or that’s it — I’m out. I’m not asking again.” His blue eyes, normally alight, seemed clouded with gray. “I’m too much in love with you to just be friends.”I had known this moment would come. He’d first proposed almost two years before. Of course he wouldn’t wait forever. We stood for a moment looking at each other, and I nodded.“When I come back,” he said, “I need an answer, yes or no. You don’t have to tell me when. You just have to tell me if.”“Okay,” I told him. And then he was gone.
[...]
The evening Joe got back from South Africa, he didn’t drive home from the airport but came straight to my apartment. [...] I invited him in, but even after the long flight, he had no intention of relaxing for a moment. He stood firm in my foyer and fixed his eyes on me. “I want to know your answer,” he said.I could see that he didn’t want to lose me, but he would walk away for his boys. There was concern in the corners of his eyes, a sternness, and I wondered if the fears that were still nagging at the back of my mind were as visible. But even in the tension of that small entryway, I could feel his love, and I knew it was forever, unconditional. I knew that he and the boys had my heart, and we were too intertwined now to protect ourselves from each other. Marriage license or not, we were already a family.I looked at him and quietly said, “Yes.”"	true
6324	A Ghanaian immigrant and United States Army private named Emmanuel Mensah died after saving multiple lives in a Bronx apartment building fire.	"Emmanuel Mensah was an Army private and immigrant from Ghana who lost his life on 28 December 2017, after saving the lives of multiple neighbors during a horrific apartment fire in the Bronx. A 29 December 2017 account of his heroism appeared in the New York Times:Private Mensah was found in Apartment 15, his uncle said, but he lived in Apartment 11, with a friend of his father’s who was at home with his wife and four children. [He] got that family to safety, then pulled out four more people, his uncle said, before returning to the building. He never emerged; the authorities said he died of smoke inhalation.Just a few weeks later, Mensah’s story gained renewed interest after President Donald Trump, during a bipartisan meeting about immigration reform, allegedly (and infamously) asked the group: ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" referring to Haiti, El Salvador and the entire continent of Africa.After Trump's comments were reported, social media users widely shared Mensah's story as a counterpoint to Trump’s dismissal of immigrants from Africa. A tweet by editor Bill Kristol of the conservative Weekly Standard gave the story both increased exposure and formed the basis for a similarly worded and widely-shared meme:Two weeks ago a 26-year old soldier raced repeatedly into a burning Bronx apartment building, saving four people before he died in the flames. His name was Pvt. Emmanuel Mensah and he immigrated from Ghana, a country Donald Trump apparently thinks produces very subpar immigrants.This story is true. Mensah was a Private First Class in the New York National Guard, immigrated to the United States from Ghana, and became a naturalized United States citizen on 21 September 2017, just weeks before his death. His actions during the Bronx fire have been widely reported. New York City's mayor, Bill de Blasio, commended his actions in a 30 December 2017 tweet:Private Emmanuel Mensah was a first generation immigrant, a soldier, and a New Yorker. He gave his life rescuing his neighbors in the Bronx fire. His heroism exemplifies the best of our city. Rest in peace.On 1 January 2018, Secretary of the Army Mark T. Esper approved Mensah to posthumously receive the Soldier's Medal, described as the ""Army's highest award for heroism that occurs outside of combat."" His citation reads:"	true

2130	The U.S. Constitution contains no pronouns.	Conservatives online have been taking offense at the use of gender pronouns to introduce oneself, particularly after Vice President Kamala Harris described herself with “she/her” pronouns in a meeting at the White House in late July 2022.  Anger at pronoun usage has been ongoing for a long time as part of resistance to gender-inclusive language that accommodates the needs of transgender and nonbinary people. Some conservatives, like this GOP congressional candidate in Florida, have been tweeting out criticisms of the practice:Many have pointed out that the Constitution is filled with pronouns, however. Merriam-Webster defines pronouns as “any of a small set of words (such as I, she, he, you, it, we, or they) in a language that are used as substitutes for nouns or noun phrases and whose referents are named or understood in the context.” Indeed, pronouns are a necessary part of the English language, and the Constitution famously begins with the pronoun “We”: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.According to Darrell A.H. Miller, a professor of law at Duke University, pointed out that the early meaning of this “We” was not very inclusive, and there were no female pronouns in the Constitution: How egalitarian is this We? In the early republic, not very. African Americans certainly were not included in this We. Nor were women, except in some derivative sense, perhaps. But, the Fourteenth Amendment, Brown v. Board of Education, the Warren Court revolution, the (stymied but influential) Equal Rights Amendment, the elevation of one, then two, then four women to the High Court, Obergefell v. Hodges, 17 all made the We more capacious. As Kathleen Sullivan notes: “When new groups were recognized as members of the popular sovereign, The People fundamentally altered their national identity and recommitted to their newly shared commitments.” The We came to contain multitudes.”He added that the “​​The Constitution leans heavily on the pronoun they.” He explains how this pronoun was used and the possible meanings behind it:They and its cognates appear over fifty times in the Constitution, often, but not exclusively, to describe the structure of the legislative powers in a House of Representatives and a Senate assembled in Congress. The House is a they; the Senate is a they; the Congress is a they. Coming so quickly after the stirring pronouncement that the Constitution was ordained by “We the People of the United States,” the switch to the third person plural is somewhat jarring. A majestic statement about unity and nation building, about us, quickly turning into a them. But perhaps this should come as no surprise. As most historians note, the Founding generation was deeply skeptical of anything that smacked of unchecked “democracy”— which they associated with intemperance, demagoguery, and tyranny. It should not come as a shock then that when the institutions of representative government are referenced, it is with a pronoun that stands at a step removed from the sovereign people. Other buffers between the people and the organs of government are similarly smothered in they — the Electoral College, the life-tenured Article III judiciary. This is not the only time Spicer tried to score a political point with these statements that defy or ignore the very rules of the English language. On July 24, 2022, she tweeted, “There are no pronouns in the Bible.” Except, of course, there are, starting with God who is referred to as “he.” 	false
2499	A 96-year-old woman named Elly gave a neighbor, Steven, her house, where he found $15,000 in cash.	"Since at least 2021, an online advertisement has claimed: ""Woman Leaves House to Neighbour, His Mouth Falls Open When He Sees What's Inside."" The picture shows a red circle on a window. We found the same sort of story in a YouTube video titled: ""96 Year Old Woman Donates Her House To A Neighbor Her Heart Drops When She Went Inside.""However, this is all very misleading.The ad, hosted by the Taboola advertising network, likely appeared alongside legitimate news stories on websites for news organizations. This perhaps gave the impression to readers that it was a genuine account of a remarkable moment.We clicked the ad. It led to a 50-page slideshow article on a website named Mister Story. The story was about a 96-year-old woman named Elly. The first page read as follows, including the last part which was bolded by the author:This 96-year-old woman could no longer live in her cottage because she had to go to a care home and so she decided to donate her home to a homeless person, who was always nearby. He was desperate to have a roof over his head and so he moved in in good spirits.But what he found inside was stunning!In the story, Elly fractures her hip, and her family urges her to move into a retirement home near them. She decides to leave her house to a homeless man named Steven, who eventually finds $15,000 in cash inside the dwelling. Elly later tells him the money is to repay him for his ""kindness and help."" In the end, she dies in the retirement home. No last names were provided anywhere in the tale.While this is a nice story, it's also completely made up. We found a disclaimer on the 50th page of the slideshow article that said the story is for ""entertainment purposes"":Steven would see Elly one more time before she passed away. He went to visit her in the retirement home about 6 months after she had given him the house and the money. He could call a million times, but he had to thank her at least once in person. Thank the person who changed his life forever.*This is a story for entertainment purposes. The photos that have been used are Stockphotos.In other words, the ""Woman Leaves House to Neighbour"" story was simply a work of fiction, something that wasn't revealed to readers unless they clicked ""Next Page"" around 50 times."	false
3095	"An online advertisement urging readers to ""wrap a rubber band around your door lock tonight"" revealed a critical safety tip."	"An online advertisement implied there was a security reason for looping rubber bands on doorknobs. It led to a lengthy slideshow article. Forty-two pages later, the story didn't even mention doorknobs.The idea of wrapping a single rubber band around both knobs on a door (to minimize noise for example) has been featured in online advertisements for years. One such ad claimed: ""Wrap A Rubber Band Around Your Door Lock Tonight."" The ad appeared to hint at a critical safety concern.We clicked the ad and were underwhelmed, to say the least. Another version said: ""Put Rubber Bands Over Your Door Knobs If Alone, Here's Why.""The ad led to 42 pages of purported ""unique life hacks."" Some of the tricks in the long story were perhaps a bit odd. One of the pages mentioned how to stack more than one large bowl in the microwave at the same time. It claimed that stacking one of the bowls on a mason jar can free up space down below. It's unclear how often someone is both short on time and needs to microwave many bowls at once.On the first page, a picture of the doorknob trick appeared as a tease. Another photograph showed coins and plastic in a hotel sink, which we previously covered in a separate fact check.However, the lengthy slideshow article never ended up explaining anything about attaching a rubber band to doorknobs. It was clickbait, plain and simple.As for whether a rubber band on doorknobs actually serves a purpose, the answer appeared to be a questionable ""yes.""One of the tips we found involved twisting a rubber band so that the door cannot snap into the door frame. Good Housekeeping advised readers to ""loop a rubber band around a doorknob so it makes an 'X' that presses the latch open."" The column said that the trick is ""especially helpful when you're unloading an armful of groceries, or need to open a sticky door without waking a sleeping toddler (or husband).""And where would we be without mentioning what might be the authority on all things rubber bands: rubberband.com. In a blog entry from 2014, the website said that hooking a rubber band around both knobs could help with noise. Without twisting the rubber band to hold the latch open, the trick could potentially help lessen the sound of a door being slammed.In sum, rubber bands probably won't let you down as badly as misleading ads will.For further reading, we previously reported about a Facebook post that claimed robbers were using rubber bands to break into houses."	false
2940	Domino’s Pizza is bringing back the Noid, a villainous mascot that coincidentally shares a name with a real man who once took hostages at a Domino’s shop in 1989.	"Domino’s Pizza is bringing back a mascot with a controversial history, according to an announcement from the company on April 26, 2021.The Noid was a villainous mascot created by the pizza company in the mid-1980s. With rabbit ears and buck teeth, the Noid was meant to act as a foil for the company, constantly trying and failing to thwart attempts to fulfill delivery orders in less than 30 minutes. The idea for it came from the rivalry between the delivery-focused Domino’s and Pizza Hut, where customers mostly ate in the restaurant at the time.In a statement, Kate Trumbull, Domino’s vice president of advertising, described why the Noid returned: ""The Noid is Domino's oldest and most famous villain, and the pizza delivery testing we're doing with Nuro's autonomous vehicle is exactly the kind of technology innovation that could provoke the Noid to return. However, after 35 years of practice in avoiding the Noid, we're pretty confident we know how to defeat it.""But the Noid was also associated with a more troubling real-life incident involving hostages and a gunman. According to The Washington Post, in 1989 a gunman who shared the same name as the mascot, Kenneth Lamar Noid, attacked a Domino’s restaurant in an Atlanta suburb and took two employees hostage as a result of a misunderstanding.According to a 1989 Associated Press report, a police officer said that Noid was ″having an ongoing feud in his mind with the owner of Domino’s Pizza about the ‘noid’ commercials. Apparently, he thinks they’re aimed at him.″ The police engaged in a standoff with Noid who wanted $100,000 and an unidentified library book in return for the two hostages’ release.According to The Washington Post, Noid also demanded a white limousine that could serve as a getaway car and insisted on talking to Domino’s owner directly. He felt that Domino’s owed him money for the name, according to one of the employees he took hostage. When the police arrived he reportedly fired four warning shots into the ceiling.The standoff lasted six hours after which Noid surrendered peacefully and the hostages escaped. No one was hurt. Noid was charged with kidnapping, aggravated assault, and theft by extortion, but a judge ruled he was not guilty of the charges by reason of insanity. He received psychiatric care, but Noid died by suicide in 1995.Despite this history, the company seems eager to bring the Noid back. Noid's return will include appearances in the “Crash Bandicoot” gaming series and Domino’s promotions of its driverless cars, which are meant to streamline deliveries. According to Domino’s statement: Domino's Pizza Inc. (NYSE: DPZ), the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, has always had one nemesis: the Noid – an antihero that has been trying to prevent great pizza delivery since 1986. Maybe it was the chaos of 2020 that gave the Noid the confidence to return, or possibly the fact that Domino's has continued to innovate around great pizza delivery with amazing technology. Whatever the reason, the Noid simply can't stand it anymore, and the pesky antihero has returned in Domino's new television ads, which begin airing today, trying to thwart the advanced technology of Nuro's R2 robot, a completely autonomous, occupantless on-road vehicle, out on a pizza delivery.
[...]
Starting May 7, the Noid will join the newest installment of the Crash Bandicoot gaming series, Crash Bandicoot: On the Run!, a new mobile adventure that honors the rich 25-year history of the beloved franchise. For a limited time, the Noid will be featured as one of the game's mini bosses, pitting players against the Noid as Crash progresses through the story. Avoiding the Noid has never been so fun!"	true
3490	The National Guard was deployed to protect the Lincoln Memorial during the Black Lives Matter protests in the spring of 2020.	"On Jan. 6, 2021, a mob of violent Trump supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol as members of Congress were engaged in counting Electoral College votes confirming the victory of President-elect Joe Biden.During the sustained attack, social media users shared a picture of camouflage-clad National Guard troops guarding the Lincoln Memorial in the nation's capital during the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020:People shared the photograph, citing it as an example of unequal law enforcement practices in responses to the summer's civil rights demonstrations versus the pro-Trump mob, which occupied the Capitol building for hours, vandalizing the chamber, parading around with the Confederate flag, and breaking into the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, among other things.The D.C. National Guard did deploy in response to the violent mob— with the approval of Vice President Mike Pence — after initial reports indicated the troops would not be deployed.These rioters were acting on Trump's prolonged disinformation campaign in which Trump falsely claimed the November 2020 election was beset by massive-scale fraud. Trump lost by more than 7 million ballots and 74 electoral college votes.The picture is authentic, as we reported in June 2020, and shows National Guard troops stationed around the Lincoln Memorial. As the caption on the Getty Images photograph states, the picture depicts members of the D.C. National Guard standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, ""as demonstrators participate in a peaceful protest against police brutality and the death of George Floyd, on June 2, 2020 in Washington, DC."""	true
3971	U.S. President Donald Trump was golfing when Joe Biden was projected as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.	"On Nov. 7, after the country waited for several days of counting ballots in the 2020 U.S. presidential election between Democrat Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, the race was called by most of the major U.S. news media in Biden's favor. At the time of that historic announcement, social media users alleged Trump was taking a break from electoral politics on a golf course:The rumors were true.According to White House press pool reports, Trump traveled in a motorcade to the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, shortly before news outlets announced Biden's victory around 11:30 a.m. EST.""Passerby gave motorcade a thumbs down,"" according to the pool reports documenting the president's activities for the public. ""POTUS wearing white MAGA cap, windbreaker, dark slacks, non-dress shirt, shoes that look appropriate for golfing"" [sic].At Trump's golf club, Associated Press photographer Patrick Semansky snapped a photograph of Trump holding a golf club in his left hand while standing alongside three unidentified people also holding clubs, as well as picture of him completing a golf swing:Multiple news reporters confirmed the president's schedule, that he was golfing when Democrats began celebrating Biden's win and the Trump campaign issued a statement contesting the election's outcome.""He was playing golf as all of this was going on,"" a FOX News host said.Trump left the golf club about two hours after his arrival, according to the press pool reports. FOX news reported he was heading to the White House.As of this writing, no evidence suggested Trump would be conceding defeat anytime soon."	true
5418	Facebook is deleting an image of a cross carved in honor fallen firefighters.	One surefire way to get people to share an item on social media is to tell them that Facebook (or Twitter or Instagram etc...) is trying to suppress that specific item from spreading. That was the case in November 2018 as Facebook users recirculated an image purportedly showing a cross carved in honor of fallen firefighters while simultaneously claiming that this photograph was being deleted by the social network:Firefighters carved this cross in honor of the fallen in Redding. FB deleted it, let's share it like crazy.	false
329	An illustration from a withdrawn Yellow Pages ad reveals a risqué image when a portion of it is viewed upside-down.	"This is an advertisement from the yellow pages, until they realised that if you turned it upside down and covered the lady's head and the hand holding the glass, all was not as it seemed.The telephone company has now taken this ad out because of the content.Take a look at the first picture, and then the second picture (which is an inverted version of the first), watch as her face and the glass are covered — and see what you get.P.S. Where do people find the time to read the Yellow Pages UPSIDE DOWN??Some critics have long maintained that companies and their advertising agencies often employ subliminal advertising to increase sales by concealing words and images (usually of a sexually suggestive nature) in their advertisements. The nature of ""subliminal,"" of course, means that these alleged hidden persuaders are not obvious to the ordinary viewer and may require intense scrutiny or an unusual approach (such as viewing an image backwards, upside-down, or with a magnifying glass) to discern.Such is the nature of the putative advertisement from the Yellow Pages (a pre-Internet printed phone directory of business services) for a flooring company displayed above, which is accompanied by an illustration of a woman holding a champagne glass that, when flipped upside-down and cropped in half horizontally, resembles an image of a woman with no lower undergarments touching herself in a strategically sensitive area.Several clues might suggest that this image was something put together as a joke rather than a genuine Yellow Pages ad:However, there is indeed a business by the name of D.J. Flooring in Brighton, East Sussex, with one of the phone numbers shown. A call to them elicited the response that the ad was indeed genuine and had been run in the mid-1990s, and the illustration was also used on the company's vans until people started making a fuss about it. The business had to change their phone number due to the notoriety created by the ad; the previous number is now the company's fax line. D.J. Flooring's later Yellow Pages ad was rather sedate by comparison:These types of images have a history of being circulated as copylore/faxlore as well, as demonstrated by a similar example from The Ultimate Book of Rude and Politically Incorrect Jokes:  The same image incorporated into the Yellow Pages ad displayed at the head of this page has also been used in other contexts, as exemplified by a reader-supplied scan of a matchbook obtained in a Geneva, Switzerland, bar circa 1990:  Another reader passed along an example of a genuine Yellow Pages ad (from Kitchener, Ontario, Canada) for a bar that made use of this illustration: "	true
5905	Kawhi Leonard said that he refused to play for the San Antonio Spurs because of coach Gregg Popovich's anti-Trump comments.	"As reporters speculated about what was happening behind the scenes between Kawhi Leonard, coach Gregg Popovich, and the rest of the San Antonio Spurs organization at the start of the 2018 playoffs, a fake quote appeared in meme form:I am growing tired of people questioning my loyalty and trust for a team. I love the Spurs, and I once loved Coach Pop. But I am now questioning his respect for my country. I refuse to play while he continues to berate our president, my president on a national scale. I am tired of being constantly ridiculed by him about the person that I voted for. I felt it was time to take a stand. I hope and pray that you understand.This is not a genuine quote from Kawhi Leonard. It does not appear in any news report published in any credible publication. In fact, the fake quote appears to have originated with parody Facebook page ""Black Adam Schefter."" (Adam Schefter is a reporter for ESPN.)Leonard, who is recovering from a lingering quad injury, was not at the San Antonio Spurs' first few playoff games in 2018, and there has been some speculation that the NBA player is at odds with the organization. The fictional phrase was likely created to take advantage of Spurs fans worried about the star's future. This quote may have also seemed plausible as it was published on the heels of a report from the Washington Post about how Popovich's open criticism of President Donald Trump has turned off some Spurs fans:Since the presidential campaign, Popovich has shared his disdain for Trump. He has called the United States “an embarrassment to the world” and the president a “soulless coward” and a “pathological liar.” The veteran coach is disgusted by comments he called “xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic” — “and I live in a country where half the people ignored all that to elect someone. That’s the scariest part of the whole thing to me,” he said after the election.[...]“It is sad that Pop basically told my wife and my son and me for that matter that we were fools for supporting Donald Trump,” he said. “What happens when someone calls you a fool? You avoid them.”"	false

5250	A photograph shows a massive amethyst geode from Uruguay.	Since at least December 2017, a photograph of an impressively tall geode has bounced around the blogophere, almost always credited to a company called Nowar Minerals Inc. and accompanied by the description “These huge Amethyst Geodes were found recently in the Santa Rosa Mining District, Artigas, Uruguay”:We repeatedly tried to contact Nowar, which appears to be (or to have once been) an online shop that sells Uruguayan geodes, to verify the authenticity of the photograph but were unsuccessful in doing so. Although the pictured geode may be an impressive specimen, we have no reason to doubt its authenticity, as miners from the region tell us it is consistent with other locally sourced geodes, and the Artigas region in Uruguay is famous for producing impressively large amethyst geodes.Geodes are broadly defined as hollow rocks with inward-facing crystals that form via a number of different processes generally involving the slow flow of mineral material into a pockets of air within rocks. In the case of the geodes from the Artigas region, scientists believe they were formed as mineral-laden artesian water percolated through bubbles trapped in 100-million-year old lava flows:The amethyst-bearing geodes found in the flood basalts of the Arapey formation at Artigas (Uruguay) were formed as protogeodes by bubbles of CO2-rich basalt-derived fluids. The formation of the celadonite rim and the lining of the geodes by agate followed by quartz and amethyst were driven by the artesian water of the Guaraní aquifer percolating the basalts from below.A May 2009 paper published in the International Journal of Earth Sciences described the Artigas region as one of the most important for amethyst mineralization and geode mining. (Amethysts are quartz-like, silica-rich crystals tinted purple by a variety of geologic processes.) In a 5 December 2018 Instagram post, Nowar Mineral’s Instagram account described the rock in question as “22 feet tall” and weighing a “mind-boggling 26,000 lbs.”	true

White House insiders are leaking news left and right today about a shakeup to the 2020 Trump re-election campaign. According to two different White House general staffers and a mid-level aide in the West Wing, Trey Gowdy sat with both President Trump and Vice-President Pence for several hours today to discuss the “future of the 2020 ticket.”Rumors have been swirling around the Executive Mansion for weeks that Mike Pence may feel like he could be more beneficial delivering the state of Indiana and running for Senate to fill the seat of Kelly MaCadoo, who has decided to join the ranks of the RINO and retire in 2020. Pence is the best option to keep that seat and it still put him in a good position to run in 2024.

However, that previous post was not visible to users who were not her Facebook friends.We looked to verify three key pieces of information for the readers who asked us to look into this story. We wanted to confirm that a power surge in an air fryer, which was said to have been plugged in with a surge protection product, was the cause of a fire inside Jennings' home. Second, we looked to verify with firefighters whom she said she spoke with that they had seen several air fryer fires just like this one, and that they were trying to get the problem looked at by investigators. We also wanted to find more details about any past recalls of air fryers.According to publicly-viewable information on Jennings' Facebook profile, she appeared to live in Surfside Beach, South Carolina. We attempted to reach out by phone and email using contact information that we found online. We also sent her a message through Messenger. One of our questions would be to ask if the fire she described occurred in the town listed on her profile, or if it had happened elsewhere. We did not receive any responses.In the case that the kitchen fire involving the air fryer and the power surge did happen in Surfside Beach, we contacted the Surfside Beach Fire Department. On the day after we first published this story, we spoke by phone with Keith Williams, the department's fire marshal.""We can find no calls that we have ran that would have been in this nature,"" Williams told us. ""We can't find a call in our county database or in our municipal database that would match up to this call Ms. Jennings would have had."" By email, Williams also added that he would bring the supposed incident up at an upcoming fire marshal meeting for Horry County, in order to find out if any other members were aware of an air fryer fire under the name of Jennings.After finding no luck with our Surfside Beach search, we noticed that Jennings' profile also mentioned that she was apparently originally ""from Chesterville, Ohio."" An online search for Jennings' name on the public-information website WhitePages.com showed a person with the same name supposedly residing in Marengo, Ohio. The listing showed an address at a mobile home park named Bennington Springs. Chesterville and Marengo are both located within the jurisdiction of the Big Walnut Joint Fire District.On the Facebook page for the Big Walnut Joint Fire District, a post was made on the morning of June 15, just three days before the air fryer fire post from Jennings. The post said that a storm had caused a power loss in the area. It also mentioned that there had been a structure fire at the Bennington Springs mobile home park. This information seemed to line up with the details in Jennings' post.Big Walnut Joint Fire District has been busy the last 24 hours, as a result of the storm and power loss we have responded to 18 calls for service including 2 structure fires. 1st fire was with Fredericktown Fire on Yankee Road, and 2nd in Bennington Springs mobile home park. Many of our members have gone almost 24 hours with no sleep. We want to thank the community for continuing to support the Big Walnut Fire District so we can be there for you in times like this.We soon received confirmation from the fire department that Jennings' story was true. Here's what a spokesperson for the Big Walnut Joint Fire District had to say via email:Our department, Big Walnut Joint Fire District, did have a fire on 6/14/2022 at Bennington Springs mobile home park. The picture you included is that scene. It was following a power outage that was county wide due to several tornadoes. The power had been returned to the area approximately three hours prior to the fire. The residents had left the occupancy prior to the power returning. Our investigator, who is with multiple agencies, did rule the cause as the air fryer. This is the only fire our department has experienced with the origin being an air fryer. He stated there have been others - that is from his experience at other departments. This individual is no longer with our department. I do not know the final findings declared by their insurance investigator.The air fryer had been left plugged in to a standard residential GFI outlet. The extension cord [visible in the picture] was for the refrigerator which was being powered by a generator.With the mystery solved, we were also curious to find information on air fryer recalls that had occurred in 2022.On April 21, 2022, Best Buy recalled around 772,000 Insignia air fryers and air fryer ovens, saying it was because they could ""overheat, posing fire and burn hazards."" Later, on Oct. 13, 2022, NewAir recalled 11,750 of its own Magic Chef air fryers too, also because of the same reason. It's unclear what make and model of air fryer appeared in the picture posted by Jennings."	true
3797	"A portion of a scene in ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"" which depicted the World Trade Center's twin towers, was missing from the film's December 2020 broadcast on the Freeform channel."	"The 1992 classic family comedy film ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" has been aired on American television just about every year in recent memory, usually around the Christmas holiday. Its predecessor, 1990's ""Home Alone,"" is often played before the sequel to make a double feature.""Home Alone 2"" sends young Kevin McCallister, portrayed by Macaulay Culkin, to New York City, while his family flies to spend Christmas in Miami. When Kevin's family lands in Miami, they realize that they've lost Kevin. This time, instead of being home alone, he's lost in New York City.Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern reprised their roles as Harry and Marv, as did Catherine O'Hara and the late John Heard who portrayed Kevin's parents. As we previously reported, O'Hara was indeed the same actress who would years later portray Moira Rose on ""Schitt's Creek."" ""Home Alone 2"" was directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes. Ally Sheedy, who worked with Hughes on ""The Breakfast Club,"" made a cameo as an airline employee.Speaking of cameos, despite rumors that made the rounds in 2019, it was incorrect to suggest that Donald Trump's cameo was cut from ""Home Alone 2"" for Canadian audiences after he began his campaign for president in 2015. We previously reported that the scene was cut for time for Canadian television as early as 2014, and the decision did not appear to be politically motivated.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1WngHOFYVQ&feature=youtu.be&t=28In December 2020, Trump's brief scene played in full on the Freeform channel in the United States. Freeform is owned by Walt Disney Television, and in December 2020 the channel scheduled back-to-back showings of ""Home Alone"" and ""Home Alone 2"" on 12 different days, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.But one scene from ""Home Alone 2"" did not play in full on the Freeform channel, and it appeared to be cut in previous years' showings. It depicted Kevin on the ""Top of the World"" observation deck atop one of the World Trade Center's twin towers, which were destroyed nearly 10 years later in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But a shot of the towers is shown from ground level: Courtesy: FreeformThe camera then tilts down to show Kevin walking up the steps to the front of the buildings: Courtesy: FreeformThe final shot of the edited scene is a close-up of Kevin, with an abrupt end to the song that accompanies the montage: Darlene Love's ""All Alone on Christmas"": Courtesy: FreeformThe next shot starts a new scene in Miami where Kevin's parents are speaking with local authorities to try to locate him: Courtesy: FreeformIt's unknown if Freeform or 20th Century Fox edited out part of the Twin Towers scene. The scene was not edited out of the complete version of the film that can be streamed on Disney+."	true
6121	"News stories about a mass shooting at a Florida high school were timestamped days earlier than 14 February 2018, which prove that the mass shooting was actually a ""false flag"" hoax."	"A gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on 14 February 2018, killing seventeen people — mostly teenaged students. Immediately, in what has become a deeply troubling (yet entirely predictable) pattern, Internet trolls took the tragedy as yet another opportunity to hawk ""false flag"" conspiracy theories.Before the families of massacre victims even had the chance to bury their loved ones, disreputable outlets and personalities like InfoWars' Alex Jones began claiming without evidence the shooting was a ""false flag,"" or a government operation carried out for the purpose of seizing guns from Americans.Alex Leary, Washington bureau chief for the Tampa Bay Times, reported that an aide for Florida Rep. Shawn Harrison had claimed in an official e-mail that child survivors of the Florida shooting were ""crisis actors"" who travel around the country posing as victims in mass shootings:Here's the email. I asked for more information to back up the claim and was sent another email that linked to a YouTube conspiracy video. pic.twitter.com/VRSVOcjj3E— Alex Leary (@learyreports) February 20, 2018I was just made aware that my aide made an insensitive and inappropriate allegation about Parkland students today. I have spoken to him and placed him on leave until we determine an appropriate course of action. I do not share his opinion and he did so without my knowledge.— Shawn Harrison (@Shawnfor63) February 20, 2018I’ve been terminated from the State House. I made a mistake whereas I tried to inform a reporter of information relating to his story regarding a school shooting. This was not my responsibility. I meant no disrespect to the students or parents of Parkland.— Benjamin Kelly (@benakelly) February 20, 2018Others pounced on a Google search engine glitch that mischaracterizes the publishing dates of news stories to claim reports about the shooting were posted in advance. For example, a site dedicated to anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist Henry Makow posted an image of the Google search results and claimed there were ""crisis actors"" and multiple shooters, both common conspiracy theory motifs.Images like this one circulated on the message board 4chan and various other disreputable web sites:Listing the date and time for news stories is complicated, as there is no universal standard used. Sometimes, stories have no date and time on the webpage. Sometimes, a story may appear on a page that lists related stories, and they all have different dates and times shown. Sometimes a publisher might be in a different time zone and the date gets picked up incorrectly. All these things may cause us to occasionally list the wrong date. We're looking at ways to improve.Google's public search liaison Danny Sullivan addressed the issue on Twitter, explaining why some of the article dates were misleading:The time comes from this embedded in the story's code:
datetime=""2018-02-14T14:40:35+00:00""
That means the story is as of 2:40pm UTC -- IE Greenwich time, not Miami time. The publication likely forgot to set the time zone to Miami, mistakenly reporting it five hours early.— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) February 14, 2018The first is because we picked up the wrong date for a related article at the end. The others are going to be similar. We can get the wrong date for a variety of reasons. pic.twitter.com/tpKtRqrPr6— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) February 14, 2018
The ""false flag"" conspiracy theory is applied almost as a reflexive reaction to promote unfounded fears of a government takeover, which will be preceded by a forcible national gun grab (although there's never any explanation offered for how a government entity might be clever enough to keep the same hoax with the same people going over and over again for years but too stupid to be able to orchestrate a full takeover)."	false
2529	A video shared to Twitter in October 2021 showed fluid mixing together before appearing to become unmixed.	"A video shared by the Twitter account Amazing Physics on Oct. 27, 2021, showed a person squirting two dots of ink, one green and one red, into a clear vat of fluid. That person then grabbed a crank handle to slowly mix the two colored dots in with the clear fluid before reversing the crank and ""unmixing"" them back to their original locations. Though the video appears to defy thermodynamics, it is authentic and is a concept that Harvard University described as reverse fluid mixing. The cylinder-shaped vat is filled with a thick, viscous fluid like glycerin while the lines of colored fluid are injected into the reservoir parallel to the axis of the cylinder. “When the inside cylinder is slowly rotated (by means of a crank) with respect to the outside cylinder, the lines of colored fluid become mixed with the rest of the fluid. Several revolutions renders the mixture completely clear and ""mixed."" If one now reverses the direction of rotation, the colored fluid lines reappear by ""unmixing"" after the same number of rotations in the opposite sense,” read a presentation posted by the Harvard Natural Sciences Lecture Demonstration. Because the slow, steady mixing does not create turbulence, the colors are able to be “unmixed” due to a concept known as laminar flow. In contrast to turbulent flow, where a fluid undergoes irregular mixing, laminar flow allows a liquid to travel smoothly.To visualize the concept, think of a river where the uppermost layer of the water bounces off obstacles like rocks or eddies, causing it to mix and fold unto itself, thus undergoing what is known as turbulent mixing. Below that uppermost layer is the laminar flow, or the part of the water that follows a straight path and does not hit obstacles and become mixed. “Diffusion processes are, of course, much slower than the time scale of the demonstration. As one cylinder is rotated, the other one can simply think of layers of fluid being displaced without involving turbulence, the boundary layer next to the inner rotating cylinder being displaced the most and the layer adjacent to the outside cylinder the least. Counter rotation slips these layers back into place,” wrote Harvard. Sources“Https://Twitter.Com/Amazing_physics/Status/1453587546278092802.” Twitter, https://twitter.com/amazing_physics/status/1453587546278092802.

3650	In December 2020, an attorney for the neighbors of U.S. President Donald Trump's private club, Mar-a-Lago, sent a letter to the town of Palm Beach requesting that officials stop him from moving permanently into the club.	"Incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump’s post-presidential life is facing hiccups as neighbors around his Mar-a-Lago private club in Palm Beach, Florida, have said they don’t want him to move there permanently once he vacates the White House at the end of his term in January 2021.A demand letter — sent by a lawyer in December on behalf of the DeMoss family, who are neighbors of the Mar-a-Lago property and run an international missionary foundation — to the town of Palm Beach and addressed to the U.S. Secret Service argued that Trump has no legal right to permanently reside in Mar-a-Lago after his presidency.Trump purchased the property in 1985. The letter said that based on an agreement Trump signed in 1993 that converted the Mar-a-Lago estate from a residence into a private club, members could not spend more than 21 days a year in the guest suites, and could not stay longer than seven consecutive days. The agreement took place when Trump’s finances were foundering and Mar-a-Lago maintenance costs were rising. Before the arrangement was sealed, Trump’s attorney assured the town council that Trump would not live at the club. But during his presidency, Trump traveled to Mar-a-Lago at least 30 times, based on a Washington Post tally, and spent at least 130 days there. Reginald Stambaugh, the attorney who wrote the letter, argued that Trump already violated the agreement for visitor stays at Mar-a-Lago.Stambaugh wrote that his clients had security and health concerns about the so-called “microwave security fence” on the property, and how the president’s use of the club would devalue neighboring properties. He alleged that an unidentified client was exhibiting symptoms of exposure as a result of the fence, “which is known to cause permanent brain trauma and other debilitating injuries."" It is not clear when this fence was erected and if it was put up as part of Trump's security detail. The letter outlined the responsibility of the Palm Beach Town Council, as well as next steps for the Trumps:It is the Town Council's responsibility to right these wrongs and restore safety and security to the neighborhood by upholding its Use Agreement [...] In order to avoid an embarrassing situation for everyone and to give the President time to make other living arrangements in the area, we trust you will work with his team to remind them of the Use Agreement parameters [...] Palm Beach has many lovely estates for sale and surely he can find one which meets his needs.The full contents of the letter were shared by The Daily Mail. Given that Trump has legally switched his residence to Florida, and listed Mar-a-Lago as his address for voting in the 2020 elections, he has to prove he lives there for six months in the year. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization told CNN: ""There is no document or agreement in place that prohibits President Trump from using Mar-a-Lago as his residence.”Trump also signed an agreement giving development rights for Mar-a-Lago to the National Trust for Historic Preservation that saves historic sites. As a part of that deal, he agreed to relinquish his rights to develop the club or use it for “any purpose other than club use.”The next steps remain unclear. Palm Beach Mayor Gail Coniglio said the town council could take up the matter after a formal request is made to them, they need to “get some legal advice,” and “take a deeper dive into things.” But experts argue that if the club doesn’t comply, the town could sue, or fine Mar-a-Lago to enforce the regulations."	true
4513	"Nobel laureate Dr. Tasuku Honjo said that COVID-19 was ""man-made"" at a lab in Wuhan, China."	"Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and “advice” you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. 
Throughout the early months of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, we repeatedly came across variations of the claim that COVID-19 was manufactured at a laboratory in Wuhan, China. While dozens of medical experts have already debunked this idea (the evidence indicates that the virus evolved naturally), this bit of misinformation continued to spread on social media. In April 2020, for instance, a lengthy text message started to circulate on Facebook and WhatsApp that supposedly included a quote from Nobel laureate Dr. Tasuku Honjo in which he ostensibly said that COVID-19 was ""invented"" at a lab in Wuhan, China:The text of the post reads: It’s as damning an indictment as it could be stretched to. China is accused of inventing the Coronavirus in its Wuhan laboratory with whatever intent that might have prompted the venture.A Nobel laureate Japanese academician, Dr. Tasuku Honjo (pictured below), who had shared a 2018 Nobel prize for his outstanding works in the study of immunology, had revealed the reasons for blaming China for inventing the deadly virus that had already infected, maimed and killed millions across the globe.Professor Honjo maintains, “I know the Chinese labs where the virus was perfected. I called many times since the Wuhan breakout. Phones are dead. Doctors and technicians involved were killed.”He added, “natural viruses are temperature and climate-sensitive. Corona had affected every nation, irrespective of geography, climate and temperature. Had it been natural, it’s spreading would have been limited to Wuhan like places and climate.”Dr. Honjo threw a challenge in support of his finding and the assertions, saying, “if it’s not proven even after my death, take away my Nobel prize.”Honjo never worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the quotes in this post are fictitious, and China did not ""invent"" this virus. But in this message's defense, it does accurately state that Honjo won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2018.Honjo is currently the Deputy Director-General and Distinguished Professor at the Kyoto University Institute for Advanced Study. A biography on the KUIAS website lists the various institutes and academies Honjo has been associated with since the 1960s. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is not included. We searched for the quotes included in this viral text but could not find them reported by any credible sources. In fact, it appears that this quotation exists solely in social media posts. We did find a Twitter account using the handle @TasukuHonjo that expressed similar sentiments as the above-displayed quotes, but it doesn't appear that this account actually belongs to the Nobel Prize winner. For starters, this account is not verified. It is also only a few days old (its first tweet was posted on April 23) and it has been used almost exclusively to push conspiratorial content regarding COVID-19. The Indian fact-checking website News Meter managed to contact one of Honjo's students who issued a statement on the Nobel Prize winner's behalf. The statement confirmed that this Twitter account was fake, that Honjo never worked at the Wuhan lab, and that these were not real quotes: Prof. Honjo never gave any such statement. Each and every sentence of this post is completely false and has no connection with truth. Prof. Honjo never worked in Wuhan laboratory. He never called there. He did not work on virus origin and functions and other related issues. All the contents are just concocted and nothing else...... The twitter handle you mentioned does not belong to Prof. Tasuku Honjo. it is created by someone possibly with malicious intentions. Please stop this fake news.Furthermore, Honjo's genuine public statements about the pandemic fly in the face of the quotes presented in this viral piece of text.For instance, in an interview with the Nikkei Asian Review, Honjo was asked why medical advancements have not been able to eradicate infectious diseases. While the fake quote included in the above-displayed text falsely claimed Honjo said that ""natural viruses"" couldn't spread around the globe due to factors such as climate, Honjo's genuine response to this question shows that he actually has the opposite view, saying that ""one novel virus can turn the world on its head"" and that ""infectious disease can spread quickly to a large number of patients.""Honjo said:Medicine has evolved dramatically even compared with 20 years ago, but every new virus requires a new response. Physics and chemistry have established principles, but biology is a science that's still developing, and there's so much we still don't know. So one novel virus can turn the world on its head. Many people probably wonder why, but that's just the reality.Infectious diseases are completely different from something like cancer. Infectious diseases can spread quickly to a large number of patients. Meanwhile, incidence and survival rates for cancer largely stay constant, and expertise in the area is growing steadily.Research into infectious diseases needs to go hand in hand with immunology. There's no point in looking only at the virus, and we need to know how people battling the virus respond to it.On April 27, 2020, Honjo published a statement saying that he was ""greatly saddened"" that his name, and the name of Kyoto University, have been used to spread misinformation.Honjo wrote:In the wake of the pain, economic loss, and unprecedented global suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am greatly saddened that my name and that of Kyoto University have been used to spread false accusations and misinformation.This is a time for all of us, especially those of us devoting our careers to the forefronts of scientific research, to work together to fight this common enemy. We cannot delay one moment in this effort to save the lives of our fellow humans. At this stage, when all of our energies are needed to treat the ill, prevent the further spread of sorrow, and plan for a new beginning, the broadcasting of unsubstantiated claims regarding the origins of the disease is dangerously distracting.This University devotes itself to furthering the wellbeing of humanity based on a principal of harmonious coexistence with the natural environment. It is my enduring pleasure and honor to support this aim to my fullest. Let us keep our eyes on the highest goals attainable by our species."	false
6306	A scene from a 2006 episode of the soap opera 'Lindenstrasse' is evidence of a German government effort to convince Germans to accept Muslims or become Muslim.	"In early 2018, far right web sites turned their attention to a years-old episode of a long-running German soap opera, claiming that a conversation about Islam between a fictional woman and her son was evidence that the government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel was using propaganda to persuade Germans to convert to Islam, or accept Islam within German society. The show caused a quite a stir in those circles. ""Germany is brainwashing children to become Muslim for more than a decade,"" read a headline of one such article, on the Voice of Europe web site. ""German state TV is working to prepare the German people for their future,"" wrote Robert Spencer for Jihad Watch. The Vlad Tepes blog wondered aloud whether the scene constituted ""brutal German state propaganda to encourage children to be Muslims."" Paul Joseph Watson, editor-at-large for the conspiracy theorist web site Infowars, incorrectly placed the soap opera episode as taking place after Germany's 2017 federal elections in a YouTube video. And on 12 January 2018, the right-wing German web site Politikstube sparked the wave of interest in the video clip, writing: ""Unbelievable what force-fed television brings about: 'From today on we call God Allah.'""It was immediately picked up and augmented with heavily charged and offensive commentary by Politikstube. The subtitles in this video are accurate, apart from the offensive translation of the Shahada (the declaration of Muslim faith), which is recited in Arabic and means ""There is no God but God. Mohammed is the messenger of God"":
The source of all this concern is a scene from Episode 1084 of the highly popular and long-running weekly soap opera Lindenstrasse, which is broadcast by Germany's main publicly owned television channel Das Erste, roughly equivalent to the UK's BBC One channel.In the episode, entitled ""Islam,"" Lisa Hoffmeister is engaged to be married to her Turkish fiancé Murat Dagdelen, who is a secular, moderate Muslim. Convinced that she must convert to Islam in order to be accepted by Murat's family, Lisa has done some research and sits down to explain what she understands to be the nature of Islam and conversion to her son, whom she had during a previous relationship. During the scene, Lisa performs the Shahada and encourages her son to pray to Allah and ""follow his rules.""We discussed the episode with Michael Meisheit, a screenwriter and novelist who wrote for Lindenstrasse for 20 years, and who scripted the episode in question. Speaking to us by Skype from his home in Berlin, Meisheit told us that Lisa has a ""long history of really problematic issues"" in the show. As a child, she was abused and neglected, spent time in an orphanage, and once even killed someone in self-defense. Though not a villain, she is, in the writer's words, ""the girl who's always doing strange stuff"" and doesn't have a firm grasp on social boundaries. Along the way, she meets Murat Dagdelen, a Turkish man who is the first character to truly love and accept her. In response, Lisa becomes ""over-engaged"" in trying to ""fit in"" with Murat and his family, who are Muslim, albeit to varying degrees of devoutness. Meisheit told us that Murat is not a particularly committed Muslim, but Lisa is convinced that before marrying him, she herself must become a Muslim, in order to fit in with his family. In Episode 1084, Lisa suggests to Murat that she accompany him to the mosque, which he himself does not regularly attend. Confused, Murat tells Lisa ""But you're not even Muslim.""""That's all that is needed to trigger that kind of character,"" Meisheit says. ""'Why am I not a Muslim? How hard can that be?' Then she looks it up on the internet, and the result is that scene [the conversation with her son.]""In response to Lisa's zealousness, those around her (including Murat and his family) tell her to ""take it slow"" and ease off in her conversion to Islam. ""If you criticize this scene alone,"" Meisheit says, ""you're taking it very much out of context. You could very well say the opposite about that scene.""So rather than being ""propaganda"" designed to ""brainwash"" German children and adults to convert to Islam, the subplot of Lisa's conversion to Islam and the scene showing her conversation with her son were deliberately written to show someone with a history of personal problems overdoing her conversion to Islam in an unnecessary and somewhat desperate effort to ""fit in"" with her fiancé's family, who love her anyway. Meisheit says he deliberately wrote the scene ""to show she is overreacting for personal reasons, not religious reasons,"" and that this behavior is ""very typical for that character."" In later episodes, Lisa takes to wearing a Muslim headscarf, but ultimately relents in her zealousness after Murat's aunt — who is a secular Muslim like Murat himself — takes her aside and tells her that her efforts are appreciated but unnecessary, and that Murat's family loves and accepts her as she is. When the episode first aired in Germany in 2006, there was no public outcry or negative reaction, Meisheit told us. As the person who wrote the episode, and the scene involving Lisa's son, he says he finds the uproar, a full twelve years later, to be ""bizarre, knowing what the scene really was."" He added:For me it's a textbook example of taking something out of context.The accusation of ""brainwashing"" by the German state is also unfounded in a second important way. Lindenstrasse is shot and produced in Cologne by Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WRD), one of several regional public television channels that form the ARD consortium, which broadcasts content on a national level on Das Erste — Germany's biggest publicly-owned national television channel.So it is true to say that Lindenstrasse is both made and shown by a public broadcaster. However, the German federal government does not control the content of the show. This was confirmed to us by WDR's Goetz Schmedes, the commissioning editor of Lindenstrasse.The characters, plots and story arcs are all created by the show's writers and producers, Meisheit told us. When he wrote Episode 1084, including the conversation between Lisa and her son, he did so without interference from executives at WRD or ARD, or from the German government. ""Nobody told me to do that,"" he said. "	false
172	Dangerous cosmic rays will pass near Earth tonight, causing bodily harm if you keep personal electronics near you.	"Rumors of dangerous cosmic rays passing by Earth ""tonight,"" largely identical in their phrasing, have been steadily collecting in our inbox for well over a year. The warning, which has been around since at least 2014, and whose timelessness is assured by the lack of specific dates or a discussion of time zones, is generally phrased as such:VERY URGENT! Tonight at 00:30 to 03:30am make sure to turn off your phone, cellular, tablet etc & put far away from your body! Singapore TV announced on the news! Please tell your family & friends! Tonight 12:30pm to 3:30am for our Planet will be very high radiation! Cosmic rays will pass close to Earth, So please turn off your cell phone! Do not leave your device close to your body, it can cause you terrible damage! Check Google & NASA BBC News! Send this message to all the people who matter to you! Thank youEqually imprecise is the science involved in the warning. When astronomers discuss cosmic rays, they are almost always referring to high energy protons from outside our solar system that travel at nearly the speed of light and are thought to be ejected from supernovae, the explosion of stars. Sometimes, however, the term also includes high-energy particles from the sun, as described by Caltech astronomer Richard Mewaldt:Cosmic rays are high energy charged particles, originating in outer space, that travel at nearly the speed of light and strike the Earth from all directions. Most cosmic rays are the nuclei of atoms, ranging from the lightest to the heaviest elements in the periodic table. [...] The term ""cosmic rays"" usually refers to galactic cosmic rays, which originate in sources outside the solar system, distributed throughout our Milky Way galaxy.However, this term has also come to include other classes of energetic particles in space, including nuclei and electrons accelerated in association with energetic events on the Sun (called solar energetic particles), and particles accelerated in interplanetary space.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (among other agencies) constantly monitor the sun for events that would eject solar particles in the direction of Earth. They do this not because of the health risk they pose to humans (unless you are an astronaut in space) but because of the risk they can pose to electrical grids and devices, as described by NASA:When struck by [...] a coronal mass ejection, our planet's magnetic fields jostle back and forth. This generates electric currents, radio waves, and accelerates particles. As the atmosphere changes, GPS satellite frequencies that must travel through the ionosphere can be disrupted, resulting in errors of [...] a couple of yards. For airlines, military operations, farmers' vehicles, and financial transactions that rely on GPS, this interference can prove damaging.Another type of eruption from the sun, called a solar flare, can interfere with shortwave radios. These low frequency radio waves use the ionosphere as a mirror to reflect transmissions around the globe; but during a solar storm, they simply disappear up into the sky—unable to bounce off of an atmosphere so changed by these storms.These events would cause no direct health risk to humans on the surface of Earth, and as such that non-existent risk would not be exacerbated by the presence of a cell phone near you. The idea that NASA would send out a warning to that effect is belied by the fact that not a single warning regarding solar activity from 2010 to 2015 provided any guidance on the placement of your cell phone during such an event. Additionally, the three hour window for avoiding your cell phone is nonsensical, given the fact that such events generally disrupt our magnetic field for a longer period of time.If, however, the warning was referring to a more classical definition of cosmic rays — the high energy (mostly) protons that come from supernova explosions — then the warning is on even shakier scientific ground. That's because cosmic radiation, which is bouncing around all over the place and deflected by any magnetic field it runs into, is not easily tied to a single origin. In fact scientists only conclusively proved that cosmic rays generally come from supernovas in 2013, despite suspicions for a century prior. Cosmic radiation is a slowly varying background process that does not necessitate any action on your part.The only conceivable source of an acute cosmic radiation spike would be a stream of particles ejected directly at Earth from a nearby supernova explosion. In addition to the fact that such an event would conceivably offer decades of warning, and therefore make an exclusive scoop by Singapore TV unlikely, there are also no stars both close enough to us and close enough to the end of their life cycle to produce such an event, according to NASA:Astronomers estimate that, on average, about one or two supernovae explode each century in our galaxy. But for Earth's ozone layer to experience damage from a supernova, the blast must occur less than 50 light-years away. All of the nearby stars capable of going supernova are much farther than this.In terms of health effects to humans on the ground, this background cosmic radiation, similar to the solar radiation, poses no immediate harm and cannot be considered a health risk only unless you are chronically exposed to higher radiation levels in polar regions, according to NOAA:When these particles hit the atmosphere, large showers of secondary particles are created with some even reaching the ground. These particles pose little threat to humans and systems on the ground [...]. The Earth's own magnetic field also works to protect Earth from these particles largely deflecting them away from the equatorial regions but providing little-to-no protection near the polar regions [...]. This constant shower of GCR particles at high latitudes can result in increased radiation exposures for aircrew and passengers at high latitudes and altitudes."	false

422	In May 2023, actor Tom Hanks said he planned to use artificial-intelligence (AI) technology to keep making films after his death.	"In a podcast interview that aired on May 12, 2023, Hanks acknowledged the possibility of having his likeness recreated by AI and used in films; however, he did not say he would definitely use the technology to make films after his death. In full context, he was speaking on the technology's potential impact on the film industry as a whole — not his career specifically. On May 19, 2023, an article on Disney Dining, a website that purports to publish Disney news, claimed that actor Tom Hanks said he would keep making movies after his death by using artificial-intelligence technology. The article's headline stated, ""Actor Tom Hanks Will Keep Making Films After His Death.""In its opening paragraphs, the article claimed:Tom Hanks says he'll be making Hollywood blockbusters long after he dies.Most successful Hollywood actors intend to keep making movies until they die. But actor Tom Hanks–a two-time Academy Award winner and four-time Golden Globe winner–says that won't stop him, and he will continue his acting career, even after he passes away.The article went on to accurately transcribe real quotes from the actor during an interview on The Adam Buxton Podcast, hosted by British comedian Adam Buxton. However, for the purpose of this fact check, we're focusing on the article's underlying claim — which was a false characterization of Hanks' words in the interview. In that interview, which aired May 12, 2023, Hanks talked about the possibilities and concerns that artificial intelligence generated, and the potential legal ramifications for actors who wanted to protect their image, voice, or other characteristics as intellectual property. He discussed on a theoretical level how his image could be used and never said he would use artificial intelligence to make films in any circumstance, much less to keep making films after his death. The conversation took place at the 36-minute mark, when Hanks responded to a question about whether he had placed legal restrictions on the recreation of his performances through AI. We transcribed the full conversation below (emphasis, ours): Adam Buxton: My wife is a lawyer, and she is interested to know whether you have placed legal restrictions on who gets to use AI in order to recreate a Tom Hanks performance when you are no longer acting? Tom Hanks: This is something that is literally part and parcel to what's going on in the realm of intellectual property rights right now. This has always been lingering. The first time we did a movie that had a huge amount of our own data locked in a computer, literally what we looked like, was a movie called ""The Polar Express"" which we made back around the year 2000. And we saw this coming, we saw that there was going to be this ability to take zeros and ones from inside a computer and turn it into a face and a character. That has only grown a billion-fold since then and we see it everywhere. I can tell you that there [are] discussions going on in all of the guilds, all of the agencies, and all of the legal firms in order to come up with the legal ramifications of my face and my voice and everybody else's being our intellectual property. [...]What is a bona fide possibility right now is, if I wanted to, I could get together and pitch a series of seven movies that would star me in them in which I would be 32 years old from now until kingdom come.Anybody can now recreate themselves at any age they are by way of AI or deep fake technology. I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that's it, but performances can go on and on and on and on.Outside the understanding that has been done with AI and deep-fake, there'll be nothing to tell you that it's not me and me alone. And it's going to have some degree of lifelike quality. That's certainly an artistic challenge but it's also a legal one.Buxton: Sure, but I think that people will be able to tell, because what will be missing are the unique choices that you made as an actor and as a person that produce certain performances.Hanks: Without a doubt people will be able to tell. But the question is will they care?Buxton: Yeah they will.Hanks: I think you have more faith in the human condition than others. There are some people that won't care, that won't make that delineation. [...] We're talking about literally a long time ago, this guy invented a machine that could print, that could create lies that would be taken as absolute truths by anyone who read them and then decided to believe them as opposed to examine them. And that guy, his name was Gutenberg and he invented the printing press. This is a super attenuated version of that printing press. AI, deepfake, anything will be able to lie just as well as they can go ahead and be able to tell the truth, and there are gonna be some people who are going to put a huge stake in what is authentic and what is not, just as there are going to be a ton of people who ain't going to care. In sum, Hanks acknowledged the possibility of having his likeness recreated by AI and used in films; however, he did not say he would definitely use the technology to make films after his death. Hanks said ""if [he] wanted to"" he could pitch movies starring an AI version of his younger self, but he did not outrightly say he would do that as a living actor, nor after he dies. "	false
1220	Thanksgiving is the peak day for cooking fires being reported in the U.S.	"Cooking a turkey is not quite as simple as toasting bread or microwaving a frozen dinner. With that in mind, it would not come as much of a surprise to find out that the one day many Americans prepare a large meal, turkey included, would have more cooking fires than any other day of the year.The Thanksgiving holiday is no stranger to rumors. One popular claim is that tryptophan in turkey makes people especially tired. However, that's a myth.As for the rumor about fires, it's true. In this story, we'll provide data to back up the main claim and also provide several cooking safety tips from an authoritative source.On Nov. 11, 2021, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) published an advisory about cooking fires on Thanksgiving Day, saying that the holiday had historically been the peak day for cooking fires being reported in the U.S. In the past, Thanksgiving Day had more than three times as many fires when compared to a typical day of the year.""Thanksgiving is a hectic holiday that involves lots of cooking and distractions, which can make it easy to lose sight of what's on the stove and in the oven,"" said Lorraine Carli, NFPA's vice president of Outreach and Advocacy. ""Unattended cooking is the leading cause of home cooking fires, so we strongly encourage people to keep a close eye on what they're cooking and to minimize the likelihood of getting distracted.""According to NFPA data, cooking was the leading cause of reported home structure fires and civilian fire injuries and the second-leading cause of civilian fire deaths and direct property damage, on an annual average from 2015 to 2019. On Thanksgiving Day alone, an estimated 1,400 home cooking fires were reported to U.S. fire departments in 2019, reflecting a 228 percent increase over the daily average.Similarly, the U.S. Fire Administration, a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), published that, ""For each year from 2017 to 2019, an estimated average of 2,300 residential building fires were reported to fire departments in the U.S. on Thanksgiving Day."" According to their data, the fires caused an estimated annual average of five deaths, 25 injuries, and $26 million in property loss.So, how can people reduce the chance of a fire? The NFPA published a list of Thanksgiving Day safety tips, including a few recommendations that some readers may not have thought of. For example, one of the tips said to keep a lid nearby for pans as a smart way to put out fires, as opposed to using water or a fire extinguisher, neither of which are recommended.- Never leave the kitchen while cooking on the stovetop. Some types of cooking, especially those that involve frying or sautéing with oil, need continuous attention.- When cooking a turkey, remain at home and check it regularly.- Make use of timers to keep track of cooking times, particularly for foods that require longer cook times.- Keep things that can catch fire like oven mitts, wooden utensils, food wrappers, and towels at least three feet away from the cooking area.- Avoid long sleeves and hanging fabrics that can come in contact with a heat source.- Always cook with a lid beside your pan. If you have a fire, slide the lid over the pan and turn off the burner. Do not remove the cover because the fire could start again. Let the pan cool for a long time. Never throw water or use a fire extinguisher on the fire.- For an oven fire, turn off the heat and keep the door closed. Only open the door once you're confident the fire is completely out, standing to the side as you do. If you have any doubts or concerns, contact the fire department for assistance.- Keep children at least three feet away from the stove. Kids should also stay away from hot foods and liquids, as steam or splash from these items could cause severe burns.The NFPA also added that they ""strongly discourage"" the use of turkey fryers due to the dangers they pose. ""For a safe alternative, NFPA recommends grocery stores, food retailers, and restaurants that sell deep-fried turkey,"" the NFPA advisory said.In the past, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) posted a video to show how quickly a turkey fryer, when not properly operated, can explode into a fireball."	true
2729	In August 2021, antibodies derived from a llama's blood were included in a formula given to research participants in a study that aimed to identify a new COVID-19 treatment.	"The clinical trial by a Belgium-based company was ongoing, and the actual extent to which llama-derived antibodies could help COVID-19 patients remained unknown.In addition to pharmacies, hospitals, and vaccination centers, a Belgium farm could be ground zero in the global fight against the highly contagious COVID-19 delta variant, according to news reports that surfaced in late August 2021.Why? The farmland in Ghent, which is about 37 miles (or 60 kilometers) from Brussels, was the home of Winter — a 5-year-old llama who spends her days grazing with about 130 of her alpaca and llama friends, according to a 2020 Golden Goose Award entry dedicated to her contributions to science.But in addition to those traits, Winter's immune system supposedly produced a special, very small antibody that, the August 2021 reports claimed, may lead to medical products that could stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, in humans' immune systems.In short, the underlying assertion was this: Researchers had recently injected human test subjects with a formula that included remnants of cells from a llama's blood to see if, or to what extent, those nonhuman antibodies helped combat SARS-CoV-2.That claim was true, though we'll provide some important context to make sense of the research.Years before the pandemic, Jason McLellan, an associate professor of molecular biosciences at the University of Austin, teamed up with Ghent-based researchers at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology to study camelids' antibodies and how they react to immunizations, according to the Golden Goose Award entry. (""Camelids"" include camels, alpacas, and llamas.) Their goal: to determine whether, and how, llama's immune systems could produce antibodies that could be used for medical therapies.""While humans only make one kind of antibody, made up of heavy and light protein chains arranged in a Y-shape, camelids produce two,"" the entry stated. ""One of these is very similar to a human antibody. The other, called a single-domain antibody, VHH, or nanobody, does not have any light-chain proteins. This makes it much smaller, which is a boon to researchers.""In 2016, with the support of the National Institutes of Health, the researchers narrowed in on coronaviruses. Seven such viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, infect humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most of people will catch at least one in their lifetimes and experience cold-like symptoms. Meanwhile, a smaller population may suffer severe and sometimes fatal infections from coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, or MERS-CoV.Enter Winter, who was 9 months old at the time. Researchers vaccinated her with spike proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to see how her immune system would react, according to a news release and the award entry. The NIH explained the experiment like this:[Spike protiens] latch onto cells, then undergo a structural change that allows the virus to fuse with the cell. Once the virus enters the host cell, it can copy itself and produce more viruses. The nanobodies that the scientists harvested from the llama bloodstream and produced in the lab bound to the spike protein and prevented the virus from entering cells.Flash forward to early 2020, the beginning of the ongoing pandemic.The researchers immediately realized that the small llama antibodies “that could neutralize SARS would very likely also recognize the COVID-19 virus,” Xavier Saelens, the leader of the Ghent research center, told The New York Times in May 2020.“There is still a lot of work to do to try to bring this into the clinic,” he added. “If it works, llama Winter deserves a statue.”In other words, the team — which included Daniel Wrapp, a then-structural biologist at McLellan's lab — used Winter's antibodies engineered during the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV experiments four years earlier to see how, or if, they would bind to the spike protein of the recently discovered coronavirus, according to news reports at the time.If so, that process would effectively block the coronavirus from infecting more healthy cells — in turn, showing the potential to protect COVID-19 patients from getting sicker.""Initial tests indicate that the antibody blocks viruses that display this spike protein from infecting cells in culture,"" the researchers announced via a statement.As a result, the Belgium center established a company, ExeVir Bio, to launch clinical trials. And, on Aug. 18, 2021, those agencies announced in a statement:""The first subjects have been dosed in a Phase I clinical study of XVR011, its llama-derived antibody for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.""In other words, yes, researchers indeed immunized a group of unidentified people with a formula containing the llama's antibodies to see how their immune system would respond. Those participants were chosen at random and among counterparts who received a placebo shot, according to the statement. Going forward, project leaders were prepared to administer additional doses to a ""maximum of three groups of 10 healthy adult subjects"" as part of the Phase I trial.Dominique Tersago, chief medical officer of ExeVir, told Reuters that the technology could be a ""game-changer."" Ultimately, she said they're hoping to create an IV treatment that would be available to immune-compromised people in clinics or severely ill COVID-19 patients in hospitals.Considering that evidence, we rate this claim ""True"" — with the caveat that the research was preliminary and ongoing, and the actual extent to which llama-derived antibodies could help COVID-19 patients on a grand scale remained unknown."	true
3348	A 23-year-old Ohio woman died after her head became trapped between her vehicle door and its frame after colliding with the payment machine in a parking garage.	A 23-year-old woman from Columbus, Ohio, was killed in January 2021 after her head became stuck between her vehicle door and its frame after colliding with a parking garage payment kiosk. According to the Columbus Division of Police (CPD), the fatal accident occurred on Jan. 18 just before midnight local time. Victoria Strauss was exiting a parking garage near the Flytown District in downtown Columbus. When she went to pay for her parking, Strauss reportedly dropped her credit card. When she opened her car door and leaned out of the vehicle to pick up the card, she “inadvertently accelerated and collided with the parking kiosk.”“The collision pinned her between her car door and the door frame,” wrote the police department in a post shared to Facebook on Jan. 18. Her head apparently became caught between the door and frame.An accident investigation unit with the CPD responded and initiated an investigation, which was ongoing at the time of writing. It was determined that Strauss died as a result of the collision and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to a report filed by the department.The Columbus Dispatch reported the Ohio State University graduate and Florida native was found by a security guard. The incident was reportedly captured by security cameras in the garage in which Strauss' car can be seen accelerating.	true
1573	"The FDA announced that the CDC's PCR test for COVID-19 “failed its full review” because it is ""unable to differentiate between COVID and flu,"" resulting in the diagnostic tool’s emergency use authorization (EUA) being revoked under a Class 1 recall."	"While it is true that the CDC withdrew its emergency use authorization request for one of the agency’s issued RT-PCR COVID-19 tests, it is false to say it ""failed its full review"" and false to say that it was withdrawn because the test couldn’t differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. In fact, the agency had simply put forth a new EUA request for a diagnostic that could simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A and B viruses, making it a more efficient choice ahead of the U.S. flu season.

On July 21, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a lab alert announcing that it planned to withdraw its request for emergency use authorization (EUA) for its real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic panel used to detect SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. The test was created by the agency in 2020 in response to the pandemic. In the week that followed the agency’s announcement, social media posts misconstrued the reasoning behind the agency’s decision and used confusing language to not only imply that all RT-PCR tests would be withdrawn from the market, but that it was because the tests ""failed to differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses,"" among other reasons. Snopes readers sent us social media posts like the ones below:To be clear, the CDC announced that it would be withdrawing its EUA for only the agency's 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR by Dec. 31 — but a number of other PCR tests made by other agencies and companies were still slated to be on the market after that date, as of this writing. Furthermore, the CDC issuance was not made because the agency’s tests couldn’t differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses (they can, obviously, or the tests wouldn't work), but rather because the CDC recommended moving toward authorizing tests that can detect both COVID-19 infection and influenza viruses.  “Such assays can facilitate continued testing for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and can save both time and resources as we head into influenza season,” wrote the CDC. A look at the 251 authorized molecular diagnostic tests authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revealed that the CDC listed two RT-PCR tests: the above-mentioned diagnostic panel and a second known as the “Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiple Assay.” The latter, which was issued a EUA on July 2, is what is known as a nucleic acid test intended to simultaneously detect influenza A and B viruses as well as SARS-CoV-2.  U.S. FDA While it is true that the CDC withdrew its EUA request for one of the agency’s issued RT-PCR tests created in 2020, it is false to say that it was because it couldn’t differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses (it can). In fact, the agency had simply put forth an EUA request for a diagnostic that could simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A and B viruses, making it a more efficient choice ahead of the U.S. flu season. As such, we rate this claim as false.  A PCR is a laboratory method used to make many copies of a specific piece of DNA from a sample, according to the National Institutes of Health. An RT-PCR test takes samples of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that live in the upper respiratory system by swabbing a person’s nasal cavity — but similar methods can also detect influenza viruses. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued more than 250 EUAs for individual tests that met certain conditions, from real-time PCR to home collection kits. Some of these were made to screen asymptomatic individuals, while others required a prescription. A spokesperson for the FDA told Snopes that it was important to note the difference between “authorized” tests that receive a EUA  and those that are “approved,” the latter signifying a different level of review with the FDA. An EUA allows the regulatory agency to temporarily authorize unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency — in this case, to diagnose COVID-19 in response to the global pandemic. Approved devices, on the other hand, require a much more rigorous standard of multi-level approval that can take years to attain. But the CDC test is not to be confused with other COVID-19 diagnostic tests that have been recalled in 2021. And to untangle the many iterations of recalls and withdrawals that Snopes readers have sent our team, we dug through the 34 medical device recalls issued this year. Three were SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tools. Each of the below COVID-19 tests received a Class 1 recall, which is indeed considered the most serious type of recall because the “use of these devices may cause serious injuries or death.” But let’s be clear: Any perceived injury is not from direct use of the device, but rather because of the greater risk an inaccurate test result may pose. Let’s take a closer look.On July 7, Quidel recalled its Lyra SARS-CoV-2 assay (M120) due to a risk of false-negative results. The Lyra assay used nasal swab samples collected by a healthcare provider to detect nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2. The manufacturers of the test issued their recall due to a “significant risk” of false-negative results for patients who had otherwise high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 in their respiratory system.“False-negative results may lead to delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of SARS-CoV-2 that may cause patient harm, serious illness, and death. False-negative results can also lead to further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, when presumed negative patients are introduced into groups within health care, long-term care, or other similar facilities,” noted the FDA in the recall notice. Quidel received five complaints but no reports of injuries or death from the issue.On June 10, the FDA recommended healthcare providers stop using Innova Medical Group’s SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid qualitative test. The test claimed to determine whether a person had an active COVID-19 infection by using a nasal swab sample and test strip to detect specific proteins from the virus known as antigens. If the nasal sample had SARS-CoV-2 antigens then a colored test line should have appeared on the test strip to indicate that the person was infected. Innova Medical Group also issued a recall on April 23 because the test wasn’t as accurate as its label claimed to be. Some tests were giving false-negative results, which would again lead to delayed diagnosis or the further spread of the virus. But some tests were also providing false positives that in some cases could lead to being treated for COVID-19 when in fact they were experiencing another illness that required a different course of treatment. On May 28, Lepu Medical Technology recalled its SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid test kit, which again looks for antigens, as well as the Leccurate SARS-CoV-2 antibody rapid test kit. The antibody test used serum, plasma, or blood samples to detect antibodies in a person’s immune system that were produced in response to SARS-CoV-2. This test was not used to diagnose an active infection but rather to determine if someone had been infected by the virus. Both recalls were issued on the grounds that they likely posed a risk of false results. "	false

5435	"A passage from a speech JFK was supposed to deliver on the day he was assassinated stated that ""our duty as a party is not to our party alone, but to the Nation, and, indeed, to all mankind."""	"An image graphic purportedly featuring an excerpt from a speech President John F. Kennedy was scheduled to deliver on the day that he was assassinated was recirculated on social media in November 2018:These lines were part of a speech JFK was slated to make to the Texas Democratic State Committee in the Municipal Auditorium in Austin, Texas, on the evening of 22 November 1963. President Kennedy never had the opportunity to deliver that speech, however, as he was assassinated earlier that day while his motorcade drove through Dealey Plaza in Dallas.A transcript of this undelivered speech is available via the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. The excerpt included in this meme comes from the penultimate paragraph of that text:Finally, I said in Lubbock in 1960, as I said in every other speech in this State, that if Lyndon Johnson and I were elected, we would get this country moving again. That pledge has been fulfilled. In nearly every field of national activity, this country is moving again -- and Texas is moving with it. From public works to public health, wherever Government programs operate, the past 3 years have seen a new burst of action and progress -- in Texas and all over America. We have stepped up the fight against crime and slums and poverty in our cities, against the pollution of our streams, against unemployment in our industry, and against waste in the Federal Government. We have built hospitals and clinics and nursing homes. We have launched a broad new attack on mental illness and mental retardation. We have initiated the training of more physicians and dentists. We have provided 4 times as much housing for our elderly citizens, and we have increased benefits for those on social security.Almost everywhere we look, the story is the same. In Latin America, in Africa, in Asia, in the councils of the world and in the jungles of far-off nations, there is now renewed confidence in our country and our convictions.For this country is moving and it must not stop. It cannot stop. For this is a time for courage and a time for challenge. Neither conformity nor complacency will do. Neither the fanatics nor the faint-hearted are needed. And our duty as a party is not to our party alone, but to the Nation, and, indeed, to all mankind. Our duty is not merely the preservation of political power but the preservation of peace and freedom.So let us not be petty when our cause is so great. Let us not quarrel amongst ourselves when our Nation's future is at stake. Let us stand together with renewed confidence in our cause--united in our heritage of the past and our hopes for the future -- and determined that this land we love shall lead all mankind into new frontiers of peace and abundance.Kennedy was expected to deliver two speeches in Texas on the day that he was assassinated. The other, which was scheduled to take place at the Trade Mart in Dallas, was ""recreated"" by the Times of London and the creative Irish agency Rothco in March 2018:It took eight weeks to bring to life the 2,590 words John F Kennedy never got to speak.Sound engineers pulled 116,777 sound units from 831 of his speeches and radio addresses. These units were then split in half and analysed for pitch and energy. The half units, known as phones, were each about 0.04 seconds long and had to be tested next to each other to ensure that they did not clash. The W sound in weapons, for example, is not the same as the W sound in words."	true
3832	The number of mail-in votes recorded in Pennsylvania during the 2020 election was much greater than the number of mail-in ballots requested.	"One of the many pieces of misinformation repeated by President Donald Trump and his legal team, in an effort to dispute the results of Trump's 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, was the claim that the number of mail-in votes recorded in Pennsylvania greatly exceeded the number of mail-in ballots requested:
Pennsylvania reports having mailed out 1,823,148 ballots, of which 1,462,302 were returned. Yet total mail-in voters number 2,589,242? From where did the extra 1,126,940 votes come?
This claim was egregiously wrong, however.  The 1.8 million figure touted by Trump erroneously represents either:1)  The number of mail-in ballots that Pennsylvania reported had been requested for the June 2020 primary election (not the general election held several months later).2)  The number of mail-in ballots that Pennsylvania reported had been requested by persons registered as Democrats as of the voter registration deadline of Oct. 19.  That figure did not include the hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots that were also requested by persons registered as Republicans (or persons registered with third parties affiliations or with no party affiliation) as of that date:The deadline for requesting mail-in ballots was several days later (Oct. 27), and by then
over 3 million mail-in ballots were requested, of which over 2.6 million were ultimately returned by the specified deadline for ballot counting:"	false
4306	Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam will no longer carry guns in the new Looney Tunes Cartoons series.	"Some good news for Bugs Bunny: Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam will lose their rights to bear arms in the updated HBO Max version of the beloved ""Looney Tunes"" cartoon series, according to a recent New York Times interview with the showrunner.Reports in the Times and other U.S. news outlets in June 2020 about a ban on ""Looney Tunes"" characters using guns prompted queries from Snopes readers seeking confirmation whether or not the claim is true. It is.""Looney Tunes"" have found a new home on HBO Max as a series of shorts that will feature much of the same violent shenanigans despite eschewing guns, with Fudd attempting to get that rabbit using other methods. The animated children's series that originated as a series of short film features in the 1930's started streaming on the platform on May 27, 2020. In an interview with the Times, Peter Browngardt, who also serves as the executive producer of ""Looney Tunes Cartoons,"" said: ""We’re not doing guns ... But we can do cartoony violence — TNT, the Acme stuff. All that was kind of grandfathered in.""The ""Looney Tunes"" series is known for its outlandish characters, including Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Bugs Bunny. Fudd's mission as a hunter was always to hunt down Bugs with a rifle, but he usually ended up injuring himself in the process. On June 12, 2020, Warner Bros. released a clip titled ""Dynamite Dance"" from the series, showing Fudd chasing Bugs around with a scythe.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK541L5x_IY&feature=emb_title ""Looney Tunes"" Story Editor Johnny Ryan said the the series doesn't always align with the messages kids today receive.""We’re going through this wave of anti-bullying, everybody needs to be friends, everybody needs to get along ...

3825	A signature audit of absentee ballots in Georgia must be conducted and could overturn the 2020 presidential vote results in that state.	"Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.One of the many claims U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters made in flailing attempts to reverse Trump’s defeat by Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the 2020 general election was the assertion that Georgia officials were refusing to match the signatures on the envelopes of absentee (i.e., mail-in) ballots with the recorded signatures of the corresponding voters, because that process would produce evidence of widespread voter fraud in a state which Trump lost by less than 16,000 votes:However, forcing Georgia to conduct a signature audit of absentee ballots, as Trump and other Republicans (such as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp) have called for, is something exceedingly unlikely to occur, or to change the election outcome if it did, for a number of reasons.First of all, absentee voters' signatures were already checked twice during the voting, once when they requested their absentee ballots and again after they submitted those ballots:
Under Georgia law, voters may request an absentee ballot via a paper or online application. If requesting a ballot by paper, the application must be signed. That signature is checked against the state’s voter database. If a ballot is requested online, a voter must provide their driver’s license or another ID number to confirm their identification.Voters sign an outer envelope when returning an absentee ballot, and the signature is again checked against the state’s database. The database contains multiple versions of a person’s signatures. The signatures don’t need to be an exact match, but they must be consistent, the secretary of state’s office said.When a signature is missing or not consistent, the voter must fill out a cure affidavit and provide a form of identification to prove their identity. If a voter doesn’t provide this information within three days of the election, the ballot is not counted.
Additionally, the rejection rate for absentee ballots due to signature issues in 2020 was consistent with the rejection rate in 2018 (even though absentee ballots were much more heavily utilized in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), a statistic which counters the notion of rampant absentee voter fraud occurring only in 2020:  
The total number of absentee ballots rejected for signature issues increased by roughly 350% in the November 2020 election in Georgia from the 2018 election — about the same rate of increase in the total number of absentee ballots accepted, according to data from the secretary of state’s office.The overall rejection rate for absentee ballots with missing or non-matching signatures in the 2020 General Election was 0.15%, the same rejection rate as the 2018 General Election.
Finally, even if a signature audit of absentee ballots identified some mismatched signatures that had been missed during the original process, nothing could be done to rectify those votes.  Absentee ballots are separated from their envelopes during the tabulation process in order to protect secrecy and prevent votes from being traced back to the individuals who cast them, so it would not be possible to determine which candidates absentee ballots submitted in envelopes bearing mismatched signatures were cast for and negate those votes.Both Republican and Democratic party representatives declined to exercise their right to observe the signature-matching process for absentee ballots in Georgia, and no state law requires that (or specifies how) a signature audit should be conducted:
[C]ounty election officials keep the signed envelopes for two years. Currently, there’s no state law requiring or outlining the process for rechecking envelope signatures against the state database after those signatures were already confirmed, said Gabriel Sterling, the state’s voting system implementation manager.“If a court orders it or if we have specific investigatory reasons, you do it,” he said of auditing the signatures. “If we make a precedent of ‘I don’t like the outcome. Therefore, we should start investigating random parts of the process’ ... it’s a bad precedent.”"	false
3182	To promote new legislation that would cap monthly insulin prices for Texas residents with diabetes, Texas state Rep. James Talarico said on April 6, 2021, that he suffers from Type 1 diabetes.	"In early April 2021, social media users circulated posts that included a tweet in which Texas state Rep. James Talarico, a Democrat, supposedly shared publicly for the first time that he suffers from Type 1 diabetes and said he was authoring new legislation that would cap monthly insulin payments for diabetic Texans.The alleged tweets by Talarico were authentic.On April 6, he shared via his official Twitter account as a Texas legislator side-by-side photos of him presumably being treated for diabetes symptoms at a medical facility and promoting the bill (H.B. 40) at a media event.Over the course of 20 tweets, Talarico shared a story in which he recounted experiencing near-fatal symptoms of Type 1 diabetes during a campaign event in spring 2018, and he ultimately received a diagnose for the chronic condition at age 28. The thread began:3 years ago I almost slipped into a coma and died. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. I paid $684 for my first 30-day supply of insulin. Some pay $1000+ a month. Many die without it. Today I introduced legislation to cap the price of insulin at $50 a month.I haven’t shared this story publicly before.Many accounts, like the one below, thanked the legislator for opening up and shared their own experiences of trying to pay for insulin or seeing loved ones struggle with the costs.The series of tweets went on to explain market conditions affecting the price of insulin syringes or insulin cartridges for pens or pumps. (According to a Congressional analysis in September 2019, insulin averaged $34.75 per dose in the U.S. — a total that’s almost 2.5 times higher than the average price in other countries.)As a result, Talarico said he authored the bill that would ""cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $50/month,"" pending approval his colleagues' approval.According to legislative records, dozens of lawmakers from both political parties have endorsed the proposal (the text of which is available here). For the first time, they held a public hearing on April 6, the day of Talarico's tweets.“We’ve got to make sure that people in this state who have diabetes, like me, like thousands of your constituents, do not die because they do not make the money because to afford the medicine that they need to live,"" he said at the hearing, according a video obtained by Snopes.As of this writing, the House's Committee on Insurance was considering the bill, and the Senate had approved its version of it."	true
1961	Shoes and sportswear company Adidas was founded by a former Nazi.	"The man who founded Adidas in 1949 had been a card-carrying member of the Nazi Party, but the extent of his involvement with the party and its tenets is debated. After rapper and fashion designer Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, caused an uproar by making anti-Semitic comments, a number of prominent companies rescinded their partnerships with him, including Adidas. The sportswear giant had been in a decade-long partnership with Ye, developing his Yeezy branded sneakers and other products that became best selling items. On Oct. 25, 2022, Adidas announced that they were terminating their partnership with Ye:adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech. Ye's recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.After a thorough review, the company has taken the decision to terminate the partnership with Ye immediately, end production of Yeezy branded products and stop all payments to Ye and his companies. adidas will stop the adidas Yeezy business with immediate effect.This is expected to have a short-term negative impact of up to €250 million on the company's net income in 2022 given the high seasonality of the fourth quarter.  But the company has its own dark ties to anti-Semitism, in the form of its founder, Adolf ""Adi"" Dassler, who had been a member of the Nazi Party. Dassler, according to the Adidas website, registered a company in 1924 as ""Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik"" with the aim of creating the best sports equipment. After this, the website skips over a chunk of history, and goes to 1949:On August 18, 1949, Adi Dassler started over again at the age of 49, registered the 'Adi Dassler adidas Sportschuhfabrik' and set to work with 47 employees in the small town of Herzogenaurach. In the same year, he registered a shoe that included the registration of the soon-to-become-famous adidas 3-Stripes.So what was Dassler up to before and during World War II? His first company was actually started in 1924 with his brother Rudolf. Although a German sprinter wearing the Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory's shoes won the bronze medal at the Olympics in 1932, it was Black American sprinter Jesse Owens who won multiple gold medals wearing Dassler Brothers shoes in 1936, putting the company on the map. The Dasslers both joined the Nazi party in 1933, according to the German magazine Der Spiegel. According to the Oxford Dictionary of Sports Studies, their initial company had ""prospered in the Nazi years in the 1930s, as sport became a popular pursuit associated with the goals of the Hitler regime."" Adi even joined the Hitler Youth in 1935 as a sports coach and supplier. Like many small and medium-sized companies in war-era Germany, they participated in the Nazi war effort. Four years into World War II, the shoemakers in Herzogenaurach, the Dasslers' hometown, were suffering and ordered to cease all civilian operations in Dec. 1943. The German army was in retreat, and resources were scarce. The Dassler factory's shoe-making machines were converted into spot-welding equipment for weapons manufacturing. At this point, everyone in Herzogenaurach was working for the military. The brothers reportedly disagreed on politics, however. According to the book ""Sneaker Wars: The Enemy Brothers Who Founded Adidas and Puma and the Family Feud That Forever Changed the Business of Sport"" by Barbara Smit, Rudolf was more sympathetic to the Nazi cause, while Adolf preferred to focus on the business:The stranglehold that the Nazis established on all aspects of German life forced both brothers to become more deeply involved with the movement. They signed off letters with the obligatory ""Heil Hitler!"" They held the same, swastika-stamped membership card of the National Socialist Driver Corps, the NSKK. The two brothers, however, didn't embrace the cause with equal warmth. While Rudolf vocally expressed his approval of the government's policies, Adi usually stuck to his ordinary, hardworking decency.The Dasslers aided in manufacturing the Panzerschreck, also known as the ""Stovepipe,"" a weapon fashioned after the American bazooka. The Stovepipe was a shoulder-fired steel tube that could penetrate 8-inch thick steel armor. In the plant, shoe seamstresses became welders, and French people were forced laborers. ""The Panzerschreck represented a quantum leap for the infantry in terms of anti-tank defense,"" Christian Hartmann, a military historian at the Munich-based Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ), told Der Spiegel. ""It was the first weapon that German infantrymen fighting on their own could use to destroy tanks from a distance.""And yet, it arrived too late to turn the war in favor of Germany. As Allied forces took over their town and debated destroying their factory, it was Adi's wife, Käthe, who convinced the soldiers that they were only interested in making sports shoes. And the occupying forces became a blessing for the shoe company-- after the U.S. set up a military base in the town and learned that the Dasslers had manufactured Jesse Owens' shoes, they began buying all their products. Large orders from Americans for basketball, baseball, and hockey products gave the Dasslers their first major boost worldwide. Accounts of Adi's relationship with the Nazi Party after the war varied. According to ""Sneaker Wars,"" Adi argued that his participation was a sign of ""political ignorance."" However, during the denazification efforts of the postwar era, he was accused of profiting from the war by a committee.In response, Adi cited his hiring of a prominent antifascist in the factory, alongside refugees and prisoners whom he claimed to have treated generously. He claimed that he had focused on sports, conscientiously staying away from political rallies, and was a prominent member of numerous sports organizations, affiliated with conflicting political movements. The book goes on to describe his relationship with Jewish community members:When it came to his relationship with Jews, the shoemaker's records confirmed that he continued to deal with Jewish leather traders long after this had become politically incorrect. But the most convincing piece of evidence in this respect was a letter from Hans Wormser, mayor of the adjoining village of Weisendorf, who described himself as a half-Jew. Wormser vividly recalled how Adolf Dassler had warned him of his impending arrest by the Gestapo and sheltered the mayor in his property. ""A true supporter of Adolf Hitler would certainly not have done this, putting his existence and the well-being of his family on the line,"" Wormser wrote.Rudolf eventually split from Adolf Dassler after the war, going on to found Puma as a rival operation across the river, which became a global company in its own right. Their split was acrimonious, influenced in part by Rudolf being arrested by American soldiers, and accused of being a high-ranking Nazi Party member, who performed counterespionage and censorship. He was told that his arrest was triggered by a ""denunciation,"" which he suspected came from his brother. Later, in front of denazification committees, Rudolf would accuse his brother of being entirely responsible for the production of the Stovepipe. Käthe would go on to defend her husband, saying he did everything he could to exonerate his brother, and that Rudolf was responsible for holding political speeches outside their factory.Adi was first classified by the committees as someone who profited greatly off the Nazi regime, and after numerous appeals to change his classification, his wife's defense, and amidst fighting with his own brother, he was classified as a ""Mitlåufer,"" one of millions of Germans who became party members without actively contributing to the Nazi regime. After all the mudslinging, the brothers resolved to split."	true
3183	A letter details that Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has a ‘dirty’ jail cell and has been repeatedly reminded to flush her toilet.	"As Ghislaine Maxwell awaits trial in the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn on charges that she groomed young girls for convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, her lawyers complained about “horrific” conditions there. In response on April 6, 2021, prosecutors hit back with a letter detailing how Maxwell did not keep her own cell clean and even had to be reminded to flush her toilet.Maxwell’s lawyers have been attempting to get the former socialite released on bail and said that conditions in the detention center have resulted in her losing weight, losing hair, and her ability to concentrate. They argued that the food being provided to her was not heated properly, making it inedible.The prosecutors’ letter, which is available here, also responds to a specific Feb. 16 complaint by Maxwell’s lawyers that she was subjected to an “inappropriately conducted pat-down search.” It states:MDC legal counsel further confirmed that all pat-down searches of the defendant are video recorded. Following this incident, MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell because it had become very dirty. Among other things, MDC staff noted that the defendant frequently did not flush her toilet after using it, which caused the cell to smell. In addition, the defendant had not cleaned her cell in some time, causing the cell to become increasingly dirty. MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell in response to the smell and the dirtiness, not as retaliation for complaining about a particular search.In response to the lawyers’ other complaints, the letter stated that she was assessed as “physically healthy” and at a normal weight, and jail staff had ""not observed the defendant experienced any noticeable hair loss.""Maxwell has been charged with a number of counts tied to allegations of trafficking minors with Epstein in the 1990s. A new indictment filed by prosecutors in March 2021 accuses her of grooming minors for sexual abuse until as late as 2004. She has been denied bail numerous times on account of concerns that she may flee."	true

While some of these pandemic prediction claims attempted to spread the conspiratorial idea that the pandemic had been planned, others fell squarely into the humor category.

6100	Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that pedophilia was good for children.	"The language in a 1974 report that was co-authored by Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has been analyzed and criticized for more than four decades. The piece tackled sex bias in the United States penal code. As these critics have devolved from scholars, to senators, to pundits, to conspiracy-minded web sites, to the lowly meme maker, the accusations against Ginsburg have grown more crude and distorted.In February 2018, for instance, we came across a meme featuring an image of the Supreme Court Justice and a quote ostensibly uttered by her about pedophilia being good for children: This is not a genuine quote from Ruth Bader Ginsburg.This claim is based upon a gross misinterpretation of another misinterpretation, which was itself based upon a simple misreading of a 1974 report entitled ""The Legal Status of Women Under Federal Law"" that was co-authored by Ginsburg, who at the time was a professor of law at the Columbia Law School. The other co-author was Brenda Feigen-Fasteau, a former director of the American Civil Liberties Union's women's rights project.In 1974 Ginsburg and Feigen-Fasteau published a report examining how federal law frequently employed gendered language. This report was used as the basis for the ""Sex Bias in the U.S. Code,"" a report published in 1977, which included a passage explaining the purpose of the study:The Constitution, which provides the framework for the American legal system, was drafted using the generic term ""man."" While the United States Supreme Court, the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, might have determined that ""man"" also means ""woman"" in terms of rights, duties, privileges, and obligations under the Constitution, the Court instead has chosen on numerous occasions to deny to women certain rights and privileges not denied to men.While explaining the ""equality principle"" and arguing that pronouns should be altered in the existing penal code so that both men and women were equally accountable for crimes against both boys and girls, Ginsburg quoted a proposed 1973 Senate bill as an example of legislation which used gender neutral language:The 1937 Senate bill, S. 1400, in §1631, provides a definition of rape that in substance conforms to the equality principle:A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person, not his spouse, and (1) compels the other person to participate: (A) by force or (B) by threatening or placing the other person in fear that any person will imminently be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (2) has substantially impaired the other person's power to appraise or control the conduct by administering or employing a drug or intoxicant without the knowledge or against the will of such other person, or by other means; or (3) the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old.It is the highlighted line that has been repeatedly misinterpreted and distorted over the ensuing decades.It appears that Ginsburg was first accused of wanting to lower the age of consent to 12 shortly before she was confirmed to the Supreme Court in 1993. This accusation reemerged in 2005 after John Roberts was nominated. Both Senator Lindsey Graham and Fox News host Sean Hannity, for instance, used this line to argue that Ginsburg was ""very left-wing"" and immoral:HANNITY: I guess where I am on this, if you look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I mean, she -- the Ginsburg rule, she doesn't have to answer specific questions, clearly pro-choice going in, thinks there may even be a constitutional right to polygamy, has a controversial view we should lower the age of consent to 12, supports legalized prostitution, very left-wing.GRAHAM: Well, there are all kind of hearts. There are bleeding hearts and there are hard hearts. And if I wanted to judge Justice Ginsburg on her heart, I might take a hard-hearted view of her and say she's a bleeding heart. She represents the ACLU. She wants the age of consent to be 12. She believes there's a constitutional right to prostitution. What kind of heart is that?However, Ginsburg never actually said that the age of consent should be lowered to 12.Ginsburg's report was about changing gendered language, not the age of consent, in our existing laws. In the quoted passage, she was not arguing for or against lowering the age of consent; rather, she was quoting a proposed Senate bill as an example of how appropriate gender-neutral pronouns should be used. Ginsburg wrote that she used this bill because it ""conform(ed) to the equality principle,"" not because she agreed with the presented age of consent.Furthermore, Ginsburg mentioned another section of the penal code a few paragraphs earlier which referenced a different age of consent: 16. In both cases, Ginsburg's focus was on the gender of the victim, rather than the age, as her report was specifically concerned with gendered-language in U.S. law:18 U.S.C. § §1154 and 2032 make it a crime for a person to have carnal knowledge of a female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of sixteen years.[...]The ""statutory rape"" offense defined in these sections follows the traditional pattern: the victim must be a female and the offender, a male. Protection of the girl's virtue as an asset to be traded by her family at marriage time can no longer survive as a justification for such provisions. The immaturity and vulnerability of young people of both sexes can be protected through appropriately drawn, sex-neutral proscriptions.The claim that Ginsburg said that ""pedophilia was good for children"" appears to be the result of a decades-long game of telephone that started with a misreading of a 1974 report.It started in 1993, after Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court, when this report was quoted out of context as evidence that Ginsburg wanted to lower the age of consent to 12. As this errant argument was reiterated by pundits such as Sean Hannity it morphed from a single out of context quote to an alleged personal belief at the core of Ginsburg's political views. When the ""Pizzagate"" controversy exploded during the 2016 presidential election, this rumor underwent another devolution as conspiracy theorists claimed that Ginsburg once wrote that she wanted to legalize child rape."	false
3085	A highly detailed image showed the many microscopic components that make up an animal cell.	A highly detailed image shared on social media in 2020 showed the complex microscopic components that make up an animal cell. The image was shared on both Reddit and Twitter on Nov. 7, 2020, by Mahjabin Noroozi, a researcher with the Stanford Cancer Clinical Trials Office. At the time Noroozi described it as the “most detailed model of a human cell to date.”Some social media users likened the image to what might appear to be an aerial photo of India on Diwali night, a five-day festival of lights. However, a reverse image search revealed that the image in question was titled, “Cellular landscape cross-section through a eukaryotic cell” and was created by Evan Ingersoll and Gael McGill for Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., a private biomedical company that studies cell signaling. Cell signaling occurs when individual cells communicate with one another in response to changes in their environment, according to Nature Education.The image in question was a 3D rendering of a eukaryotic cell that was modeled using X-ray, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cryo-electron microscopy datasets. Though it’s not a direct image of an animal cell, it was created to show processes that occur in animal cells.“It is an attempt to recapitulate the myriad pathways involved in signal transduction, protein synthesis, endocytosis, vesicular transport, cell-cell adhesion, apoptosis, and other processes,” wrote McGill. “Although dilute in its concentration relative to a real cell, this rendering is also an attempt to visualize the great complexity and beauty of the cell’s molecular choreography.”	true
3918	Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel published and later deleted a tweet that suggested a U.S. future under a Joe Biden-Kamala Harris presidential administration.	On Nov. 8, 2020, The Associated Press (AP) projected that former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden had defeated President Donald Trump and would become the 46th president of the United States. Trump has yet to concede and is fighting Biden's win in various courts claiming vote fraud.Three days after AP's projection, a tweet mentioning Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the deciding vote in the U.S. Senate was posted on the Twitter account @GOPChairwoman, from Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. It suggested the reality that the Biden-Harris administration is beginning in January.It is true that the tweet was deleted. McDaniel's tweet appeared to be aimed at supporting Republican U.S. Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in the upcoming Georgia runoff elections. The date for the runoff was set for Jan. 5, 2021.The tweet claimed that if Democrats were to gain control of the U.S. Senate in the Georgia runoff elections, Sen. Chuck Schumer would become majority leader, Sen. Bernie Sanders would become chair of the Senate Budget Committee leading to socialism, Sen. Ron Wyden would become chair of the Senate Finance Committee and get rid of tax cuts, Sen. Diane Feinstein would become chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and appoint liberal judges, Sen. Patty Murray would favor government control of healthcare, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the deciding vote in the U.S. Senate. The tweet ended by promoting the Twitter accounts for Loeffler and Perdue.McDaniel's tweet did not cite any sources on what appeared to be fear-driven claims. The tweet was possibly deleted after McDaniel noticed that Bloomberg and other outlets reported that the post appeared to suggest a Biden win.Two days later, McDaniel issued perhaps a safer tweet to an Associated Press story as a way of supporting the two Republican Georgia runoff-election candidates:	true

2142	The Oxford Dictionary added an entry for the word “twerk.”	"Back in 2013, as part of a quarterly online update, the Oxford Dictionary added the word “twerk” to its collection. The addition came after Miley Cyrus’ widely discussed performance at the MTV Video Music Awards, where she performed the dance movement in front of the crowd and the word became ubiquitous in popular culture.In July 2022, a Twitter account shared the following as though it were a recent fact, but these words have existed in the dictionary for several years: “Selfie” and ""twerk"" were added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), while “derp” is located on Lexico, a collaboration between Oxford University Press and Dictionary.com. ""Derp"" does not appear to be available on the OED, though the other two words are available on Lexico. We should note that Lexico is a free site offering ""access to Oxford’s English and Spanish dictionaries and thesauruses for English and Spanish language learners worldwide."" The OED is a subscription service and ""historical dictionary of English"" that captures ""the development of all words – past and present – from the moment they enter the language to their most recent usage, subtly adjusting our image of the English language with each update."" The definition of “twerk,” according to the OED, is: “A twisting or jerking movement; a twitch.” A second definition is, “A sexually provocative dance or dance move involving thrusting movements of the bottom and hips while in a low, squatting stance.” However, twerking has been a well-known dance style long before Cyrus’ performance. Katherine Connor Martin from Oxford Dictionaries said it had been used colloquially for decades in U.S. hip hop. According to the OED, researchers found the word had been used back in the 1800s, where it was spelled “twirk.” The “twerk” spelling came into use in the 1900s. However, not everyone agreed with the definition presented by the OED. Ethnomusicologist and professor Kyra Gaunt disagreed with the OED’s definition, telling Vulture in 2021: “So the word twerk went into the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013 with the wrong definition — the Oxford people got that wrong. They said it was a mix of twist and jerk. I spoke to some local people when I first went to New Orleans in 2011, and a guy driving the taxi that I was taking to go to a conference on gender, sexuality, and hip-hop at Tulane said that twerk was a contraction of to work. And I was like, Oh, of course! It’s to work that body because that is a common trope across translocal communities throughout the United States. Everybody’s “Twerk it baby, work, work that body!” It’s work.” The OED does state in the etymology of the word, “probably associated also with work v.” though it is not clear at what point this was added. Lexico also includes that etymological tidbit in its entry for “twerk,” stating: “Early 19th century (as a noun in the sense of ‘a twitching or jerking motion’): perhaps a blend of twitch or twist and jerk; in modern sense probably influenced by work.” An archival snapshot of this shows that this definition was on Lexico in 2020. "	true
2022	"After an old Toys ""R"" Us store closed in Yuma, Arizona, the same building later became occupied by a gun dealer."	"On Sept. 21, 2022, Twitter user @patriottakes tweeted, ""This old Toys 'R' Us location in Yuma, Arizona is now a gun store."" The tweet displayed two pictures. One of the photos displayed the old Toys ""R"" Us sign, and the second picture showed the same building later as a gun store, Firearms Unknown, still with the former toy store's colorful rainbow extending over its entrance, exit, and front windows. This was all true.A second tweet also showed how signage near a main road was updated from Toys ""R"" Us and Barnes & Noble to instead show the company name, Firearms Unknown, as well as ""Guns & Ammo."" The second picture appeared to come from Yelp.The address of the building was listed as 801 W. 32nd St. in Yuma. According to Google Maps, the old Toys ""R"" Us was still empty and unoccupied as of March 2021. In February 2022, the building reopened as Firearms Unknown.Photographs of the inside of the store showed walls of guns and ammunition in the same space where children and their parents used to browse toys.On July 8, a Facebook user posted about the contrast between the building's former and more recent owners, saying, ""Many many years ago, this used to be a Toys 'R' Us. Not anymore. I find it humorous that they kept the color scheme outside of the building. #pride #guns.""When did the Yuma Toys ""R"" Us store close? According to the Yuma Sun, the toy store appeared to have shuttered around April 2018, and many other store closures for the toy retailer followed as the company faced bankruptcy.The Sun's newspaper article was published on Jan. 25, 2018, and began, in part, as follows:Yuma cus­tomers of Toys ""R"" Us woke up to sad news Wed­nes­day morn­ing. The big box toy store announced plans to close up to 182 stores as part of its Chap­ter 11 bank­ruptcy re­or­ga­ni­za­tion plan, and the Yuma store lo­cated at 801 W. 32nd St. is on the list.Fans of the store filled up lo­cal Face­book groups with com­ments, most of them voic­ing dis­may but a few ex­cited about the go­ing-out-of-busi­ness sale to be­gin in Fe­bru­ary and run through April.“I liked their lay­away at Toys 'R' Us. Wal­mart only had it avail­able the last 4 months of the year but Toys 'R' Us price-matched. I guess I can still order from them on­line,” De­bra Mor­ley posted on What’s Go­ing On in Yuma AZ.“It sucks, but they’re ex­pen­sive com­pared to the other chain stores in town,” Joe Deck­ers wrote.Oth­ers lamented how the clos­ing would af­fect em­ploy­ees and oth­ers pointed out that they do most of their shop­ping on­line anyway."	true
5811	ESPN aired a graphic listing porn star Johnny Sins as a Little League baseball player's favorite actor.	"One of the most fun -- and usually innocent -- aspects of ESPN's coverage of the Little League World Series (LLWS) is the custom introductions provided for each of the players. While Major League Baseball players typically have their stats listed besides their names when they step up to the plate, ESPN uses amusing factoids to introduce the audience to the 10-, 11- and 12-year-olds who make up the roster of the LLWS.On 11 August 2018, an image purportedly showing a somewhat shocking ""fun fact"" associated Little Leaguer -- porn star Johnny Sins' being the favorite actor of player Jack Buening -- started making its way around the internet:When you’re 13 years old, and you just schooled @ESPN !!! ???@JohnnySins @JillKassidyy @nataliaxstarr @lissapolooza #Gottem #Winning pic.twitter.com/XaSLUz0Htp— Brett (@natilight77) August 11, 2018This image reached an even larger audience when it was shared by porn stars such as Lisa Ann, Madison Ivy, and Johnny Sins himself:This is not a genuine screenshot of an ESPN broadcast, however.Jack Buening played for the Las Vegas, Nevada, team during the 2018 Little League World Series, but he did not list a porn star as his favorite actor. The original undoctored graphic (right) stated that Buening's favorite school subject is science:A video of Buening's appearance at the plate during Nevada's game against Northern California (which NorCal won 11-0 to reach the West Finals) can be glimpsed at the 11:10 mark of the following video:This doctored graphic appears to have been created by Twitter user Big Heatdaddy. Although the original tweets are no longer available on that user's timeline, the Twitter account Lookout Landing posted a screenshot reportedly showing Big Heatdaddy admitting that the image was fake and offering up an apology to the young baseball player:FYI the pic going around of the *13 YEAR OLD* Little Leaguer who supposedly named a porny YouTuber as his favorite actor is a photoshop job. He actually likes science. Like a kid does. But now his full name is out there attached to this. And he’s 13. pic.twitter.com/RwiFF89Y9O"	false
2564	"An online gambling company is offering a paid, temporary job watching episodes of ""The Simpsons."""	"In mid-October 2021, various news outlets reported a strange job listing — namely a temporary position offered by a British online gambling company to watch ""The Simpsons"" for money.For example, a Newsweek headline announced, ""You Can Now Get Paid $6,800 to Watch Every Single Episode of 'The Simpsons.'""Well, maybe not you per se, but someone will.PlatinCasino, a British gambling website, posted the job. It's a temporary position requiring whichever applicant is selected to watch all 33 seasons of the popular animated sitcom, plus the 2007 movie spinoff. The compensation for the role will total £5,000, which equates to just over $6,830.The company said it's hiring for the role, of course, for wagering purposes, citing a long-standing meme in which internet users claim that ""Simpsons"" episodes have predicted notable current events:Hired to watch all episodes of the popular American sitcom, The Simpsons Series Analyst will get paid to note down standout events from the show, to help us predict the probability of each one happening.Now if you haven’t already heard of The Simpsons predicting the future, this theory has circulated globally after some of the show’s storylines have come true years after airing. Events occurring in past series that have become reality include Donald Trump’s presidency, the 2013 horse meat scandal, the coronavirus pandemic, and more recently, the fuel shortage across Britain."	true
4082	A video shows a missile striking a building in Beirut in early August 2020 and causing a massive explosion.	"On Aug. 4, 2020, an explosion in the Lebanon city of Beirut left more than 130 people dead, thousands more injured, and many of the surrounding buildings in rubble. As videos of the blast started to make their way around social media, some people started sharing doctored footage that supposedly showed a missile caused this catastrophic event.Here's a screenshot from one such video:This is not a screenshot from a genuine video of the explosion in Beirut. The screenshot comes from a manipulated video containing a digitally inserted missile. The original video, which can be seen below, does not show a missile:After the explosion, U.S. President Donald Trump added confusion to the situation when he referred to the incident as an ""attack."" The explosion in Beirut was not caused by a missile, and there's no indication, as of this writing, that this was any kind of attack.The explosion seen in this video shows the detonation of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly volatile explosive material, that had been stored at the Port of Beirut since the arrival of a Russian-owned cargo ship in 2013. For comparison's sake, approximately 2 tons of ammonium nitrate were used in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. It's not exactly clear what caused this large cache of volatile explosive material to ignite. Videos of the event show a large fire at a warehouse shortly before the blast. The sound of fireworks is also notable in videos. Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, told the Associated Press:""It looks like an accident ... First, there was a fire preceding the explosion, which is not an attack. And some of the videos show munitions what I could call popcorning, exploding like ’pop, pop, pop, pop.’""He added that ""it’s very common to see fires detonate explosives.""""If you have a fire raging next to something explosive, and you don’t put it out, it blows up,"" he said.An investigation into the incident is ongoing. The Associated Press reported that investigators will focus on why this large cache of ammonium nitrate was allowed to sit in the Port of Beirut for several years, as well as any possible negligence that led to the unsafe storage of this material.  Public anger mounted against the ruling elite that is being blamed for the chronic mismanagement and carelessness that led to the disaster. The Port of Beirut and customs office is notorious for being one of the most corrupt and lucrative institutions in Lebanon where various factions and politicians, including Hezbollah, hold sway."	false
